$review_text.: I wanted a bluetooth keyboard that looked good, and supports my iPad up and is about the size of my iPad, and reasonably priced

It's not perfect, but for the money it satisfy all my requests reasonably well, I'd give it 4.5 if I could.Connection:It was easy to connect via bluetooth


If I turn off the keyboard, it takes about 1-2 seconds to reconnect


If I leave it on, it connects pretty much right away.LooksIt looks very slick with the iPad, probably about the same thickness as the iPad


The only thing I don't like about the look is that the keyboard has a slight bend if no pressure is applied to it

So if I leave the lie the keyboard on top of the iPad it's not perfectly flushed.SupportIt supports the iPad well and doesn't tilt over unexpectedly
It doesn't hold the iPad if the case is on so I just carry my iPad naked everywhere now
I can put it on my lap and even have a slight angle and it won't tilt over.Keyboard sizeIt is the width of the iPad, which is only an inch or two smaller than the standard apple keyboard
I thought this won't make too much of a difference, but I can definitely feel that my hands are squished together when I am typing
This is not something the keyboard can help though.NoteAs with all bluetooth keyboards, certain ipad keyboard functions don't work, such as auto-correct or tap space bar twice for a period, etc

It's a bit annoying at times, but you can get used to it.

$REVIEW.: The large majority of keyboards out there are just good enough to get the job done.  Seldom have I ever used a keyboard that actually felt great to type on.  Simply put, this is not only one of them, but quite possibly the best general use keyboard out there today.  No, it's not for gamers, but for everything else, this keyboard rules.A few things to mention:1.  By far, the fastest keyboard I've ever typed on.  The keys have the soft and quick feel of a high quality laptop keyboard, but in a full-sized, stand-alone layout.  Even as I'm typing this review, I'm noticing right away just how much more fluid my typing is and fluidity equals speed as well as comfort.2.  The backlighting works fantastically well.  At the push of the dedicated button located in the upper right-hand corner of the keyboard, you get 4 Illumination settings to choose from:  High, Medium, Low, and Off.  I frequently type in a dark room and, even though I don't need to look at the keyboard while typing, I still find it incredibly useful just to help position my fingers.  It's just a pleasure to be able to see everything laid out in front of you so nicely, also.  The one and only thing to mention about this is that the F1 through F12 keys are not lit up in a soft white glow like the other keys, but the Special Functions right above them (Home Page, eMail, Media Player Controls, etc) are lit up red.  Interesting decision by Logitech on this one as I would have liked those to be lit up, also, but certainly not a deal breaker for me.3.  A quick note about setup on Windows 7 64; it's an absolute breeze.  It's basically a plug and play keyboard, but you can download the Setpoint software from Logitech's support website if you would like to change the Special Function keys.  I doubt that I will ever use that feature, but it's there if you need it.To sum up, this keyboard is a winner.  Very slim, sleek, beautifully professional in design, keys are well lit, and possesses an unmatched level of typing fluidity.  I plan to keep it for a very long time.

$REVIEW.: Kind of shocked at all the high remarks for this device. Yes. It's a stylus, and it works. I didn't expect a lot for five bucks. But... these are about the thickness of a plastic straw, made of aluminum. The stylus tip is too soft. They do function correctly, but the tip depresses too much, and too easily to provide appropriate tactile feedback. I got these for the kids since they were smaller to use on their tablets for more detailed work than their fingers. They are the right size for smaller hands. I'm kind of afraid if they pressed too hard, that the hard edges of the stylus shaft would scratch the display.I have theKensington 2nd Generation Apple iPad 1 and 2 / iPhone / iPod / Motorola Xoom Tablet / Galaxy / Blackberry Playbook Virtuoso Touch Screen Stylus and Pen (Black) Newest Modelwhich is a completely different class and isn't even a fair comparison to these.These should be half the price their sold for, even as the three pack.

$REVIEW.: What I like about this unit is that it is about half the weight of my regular Lenovo laptop power adapters. I have the Lenovo T510 and W500 which are high-performance laptops which require a 90W power adapter. What surprised me was that this 65W rated adapter works with these laptops without getting a complain about lack of power. It also works on my ACER Aspire One network with the provided adapter.This power adapter provides two type of the outputs :- 19.5 V at 3.08 A which is mainly for laptop devices- 5.0 V at 1A for mobile devicesI would recommend checking the power requirement and limitation on the mobile devices before using this on them.

$review_text.: I have a Coby player from a few years ago that works the same as this.  I got this for my wife.  The package arrived from China.  There was no documentation inside, such as a packaging list or return policy.  There was also no instruction book or wrist strap.  It did come with a nice set of earbuds.  Having said that, the machine works great.  I use a rechargable AAA battery.  Just plugged it into the usb port of my computer and used Windows Explorer to drag and drop hundreds of mp3's to the device.  The screen shows the song title and artist, battery level, etc.  For the price, this is a great little player for the gym or walking.

$review_text.: This was a refurbed WN3000RP.The fact that it was pre-owned was well established prior to purchase.When it arrived, there was no cosmetic damage - or, evidence of prior use (much less abuse).A CISCO networking certificate "would" be handy - when setting this thing up.Especially, if one is going the long route - manually configuring the parameters.Me, I cheated - and, pressed the button.I may not understand it - but, it worked.I can connect a smartphone to it and a new ASUS Transformer Tablet.You "do" have to remember (have some way of finding) the host route authentication code.The WN3000RP scarfs it from the host-wifi-router.So, it is not required for the Extender.You need it for your phone, laptop, tablet, etc. to register the device in your hand to the new extender.The instructions are legible, credible, and useable.One can not idiot-proof a device to a sufficiently motivated idiot, - but, this thing comes pretty close.

$review_text.: To begin with-I bought Kensington Pro folio keyboard case for my ipad4 with retina display. I didnt like it that much. so i decided to return that and bought this case instead. It looks great on my white ipad. This case is much better than other cases available in the market. The case feels solid and the keyboard is very stylish and sleek. There is a protection so that when closed, keyboard is not touching the front screen of the ipad. The strap provides extra protection and keep the ipad tight in the case. There are few keys on the keyboard i liked the most - one key on the top right corner of keyboard. Press it and ipad will put to sleep.There are few cons- view angle is not as great in landscape mode as it is in portrait mode, up/down arrow keys on the keyboard are non functional.Overall this is a very good case with keyboard- probably the best in market so far.

$review_text.: In the quest for the perfect go-everywhere-do-everything camera I purchased a Sony HX9V. I had previously tried a Nikon P300 and enjoyed the smaller size and f/1.8 lens. However, the video performance was subpar and i just didn't enjoy using it very much.I've used the camera for a couple of days in different environments and here are my impressions so far:PROS:-Fantastic video quality, the best I've seen from a P&S;-Fast AF in video mode even in dark environments-Fast AF performance for photos-Very comfortable to hold for larger hands-Decent quality photos in bright light-24mm wide angle is very useful-Large zoom range, zoom is smooth and relatively fast-Very sharp, bright screen-Feels well built-Effective image stabilization-Metal tripod attachment in center of camera-Dedicated movie record button-Takes both SD and MS memory cardsCONS:-Larger than some competitors, verging on un-pocketable for pants but fine for a coat pocket-Over aggressive noise processing results in lots of smudging and detail loss at ISO 400+-No aperture priority or shutter priority modes-Sluggish operating in playback mode and while zooming in playback-Start up times to first picture are on the slower side-Reds/oranges look over saturated on screenANNOYING BUT NOT DEAL BREAKERS:-Small, hard to press buttons-Missing some menu controls: no setting for: power off, review time, image rotation on playback, etc.-No external battery charger-Video is slower to start recording that some other camerasOverall I really like this camera but it does have issues (but what product doesn't?)The video quality is fantastic but the photo quality is only average (not terrible, just very average). I think this camera is great for shooting for the web or smaller prints but the detail is just not there and high ISO shots are a smudgy mess. I decided to return the Sony for a Canon S100 (more expensive but better photo qualify and more manual control.) Really wanted to like this camera but I do more photos than video so I couldn't justify keeping it for my needs.

$review_text.: This is a decent product that works well with my tripod and Nikon D-90 camera. It screws down tightly to the tripod and the plate attaches tightly and securely to my camera. I really like this product.It is plastic but I didn't find it smelly as did one 1-star reviewer. Of course I didn't stuff it up my nose to test it either. The plastic appears to be high quality and the entire unit seems to  be strong and well made. There is, however, a problem and that's the reason I've rated it three-star rather than five.It seems that additional quick attachment plates (shoes) are not available anywhere. I have multiple cameras, lights, etc., that I use on my tripods and I'd like to put quick attachment plates for this mount on all of them. I have searched Amazon, Ebay and multiple sites on the web and they just don't seem to be available. I cannot conceive that SIMA would manufacture a product like this without having additional plates available. It appears that most of the other manufacturers do have additional plates available for their mounts but they are considerably more expensive. I suspect that what may be going on here is that SIMA does, in fact, have additional plates available in their product line but none of the distributors stock them, preferring instead to sell the entire complete unit because the price for the SIMA complete unit is about the same as others charge for the plate alone with  one lower-priced exception that I could find.There is a Giotto attachment plate at less than $8 which appears to be just a tiny bit smaller than the SIMA and it may fit. I plan to order it. I will post an update to this review after I've tried it. The only other option is to buy enough SIMA complete units to cover all of my cameras which, to me, seems to be a waste of money and a wasteful use of what I think is a pretty good product. Based on the cost of the entire unit, the Sima attachment plate should cost between $2 and $3 which I would consider a reasonable price for a teeny piece of plastic.Some have complained that the SIMA will not support heavy telephoto lenses. I use my Nikon D-90 with a Sigma 600mm reflector telephoto lens and don't feel there is a problem with the 6+-pound weight. Of course the telephoto lens rather than the camera attaches to the tripod in this configuration which balances the weight securely.In my opinion, this is a five-star product which is diminished because additional attachment plates are not available. If the Giotto attachment plate does not work, I likely will upgrade to a more expensive unit for which I can buy additional attachment plates. And that's sad because the SIMA unit works for me.UPDATE: The Giotto attachment plate is too large to fit the Sima base. It's almost identical to the Sima except for its size. Too bad it won't work.

$REVIEW.: Got two of these cases for me and my girlfriends iPad 4's. The iPads fit in the cases great. All the buttons on the top and the side of the iPad are not block. The bottom of the iPad where you plug in the charger is not block. The front and back camera lens are not block at all. None of the keys on the keyboard are blocked. The case fits like a glove around the screen and none of the screen is block at all. The case  can be set  up to watch movies on your iPad or tilted up a bit to surf the web. I myself just lay it flat and type away. Does not add much weight to the iPad either. When you close the cover your iPad will click and go into sleep mode.  Then when you open the cover up your iPad will awake and be ready for use. No need to turn your iPad on and off anymore unless thats how you want to do it. There is even a holder for your stylus pen if you use one. Overall a great buy and a case I would say every iPad owner should have.

$REVIEW.: As stated in the title, it works, but there is play in the locking pin holes

The lens has a little bit of wiggle room, and you will see the image jump in the view-finder when starting to focus because the lens has a tiny bit of play

That aside, it works quite well, and I've gotten some great shots using this adapter and old Nikkor primes
While there is a little bit of play, I've never been worried that the lens is going to fall off.Issue number 2:The Dandelion AF Focus Confirmation Chip needed to be reinforced with some crazy glue
It came loose the first time I mounted the adapter on the camera, but after a little bit of crazy glue, I haven't had any issues.Overall, I would buy this product again, I'll just be sure to have a tube of crazy glue on hand to reinforce the AF Confirmation Chip.

They sounds great but are very uncomfortable -- they make my ears hot and sweaty. I tried an open ear headphones. They are not as hot but still hot. I tried in-ear earbuds; they don't make my ears hot but tend to fall out of my ears unless I keep a finger on each one, which is very inconvenient.These after shokz headphones works as advertised. There's nothing pressing on my ears to make them hot. However, I have two complaints: Whenever I move my head I feel the headphones dragging. I found that wearing them incorrectly across the forehead is more comfortable. I wish they come up with a more comfortable "wrap".Soundwise, they're not as good as my pro headphones but are perfectly ok for casual use. I also wish there is a non-rechargeable version that draws power directly from an usb port/charger so I don't have to throw them away in a few years when the battery die.

 It strikes the best balance with Mega Pixels, size, wide angle, and video


 The newer version of this camera, unfortunately, tips the balance, since it has too many Mega Pixels to process properly (resutling in reduced image quality)

$REVIEW.: If you're looking for a decent headset to use with applications such as Skype, this is the low-cost choice!  I was using a more expensive wireless headset that kept phasing in and out during calls.  With the iMicro headset, even the person on the other end commented regarding the clarity (without knowing that I had changed headsets).Don't expect a Bose-quality music-listening experience with $12 headphones.  This headset is for utility use, not listening to high-def music.  Not a thing wrong with the sound clarity or quality during conversation.  I just get irritated when somebody complains about sound quality, but are only willing to pay $12 for a set of headphones.The inline controls are very useful - Volume Up, Volume Down, Mute Microphone, Mute Speakers.  The Mute Microphone displays a RED LED so that you know it is muted.  Otherwise, there is a bright-blue LED on the control pad when the headset is plugged in.  The blue LED is quite bright, which may be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your situation.  I don't mind it.The packaging of this product consisted only of a clear plastic bag.  I don't have a problem with that, but if you're getting it as a gift, you might like to know.The microphone on the headset is very flexible, but not something that you'd want to wiggle back and forth much.  It does what it does.

I originally give it a strong three stars, I'm now giving it 5 after some use.  I thought the initial learning curve a little steep, but after figuring out how to run every feature I now feel like a king.  The picture quality and sound have been impressive to say the least. I'm also addicted to the iPod dock.Likes:1. Sounds is excellent.  Great quality for movies or music.2. iPod integration is excellent.3. Bluray picture quality is excellent.4. Unit is very attractive.  Doesn't look like a elephant in a nice living room.5. VIERA link technology provides many conveniences for those using a Pansonic VIERA TV.Dislikes:1. Unit start up is very slow and takes a good minute to boot. Not like old school amps which click on in a second or two. This can be annoying when you are just booting up to eject a rental disk to return.2. Remote and software is superior to most, but still not completely intuitive.  Does take quite a few hours to learn all advanced features.3. "Viera Link." Is powerful but still not enough to get you completely to one remote between your TV and HT.4. Could use a second or even third HDMI for those with gaming consoles.

The P600 had strikingly better image quality with more detail and dynamic range..

The Canon SX50HS shots were "soft" somewhat fuzzy and lacking in detail...in this mornings lighting..
by comparison
Perhaps it was because I had the P600 shutter set on continuous...but in any case in the "Birding" scene setting, it took the Nikon way, way, way..


too long to process a shot and the focusing as well was very, very slow

Shots were faster on "Auto" both focusing and processing

So far I prefer the handling of the Canon ...but the quality of the images from the Nikon was  better

 Everything occurs for a reason, and don't think for a moment that any reputable company doesn't have procedural processes in place from the initial invoice to the out-the-door-delivery

 If nothing else, it further enhances their company's presence to a new or existing customer


 It is most always these items that falter from lack of quality and, hence, that much more difficult to validate their source for return


 I prefer a hard copy to file without pulling orders from Amazon or N..., or God knows where, because it then becomes a mind exercise to trace its origination from an ever cluttered and taxed memory
 But then, perhaps that is their intention


 Once this occurs, they are on my 'do not buy from, again' list
Unfortunately one only learns after placing an order
 These cables may be OK, as I just received them this morning


 Should they fail as I assume they might, it will be my angst and irksome response of finally sitting down to write this that will help in my recall

 Their company expects tracking and I do, too.

$REVIEW.: Plus sides: It's big, it doesn't look bad, does real 1080p resolution, fits on my computer desk (which has a shelf over the monitor area) because it's really wide but only about as tall as my old 22" monitor, and it has two HDMI and one DVI input so I can send my upconverting DVD player's output to it as well as my computer's output


And it uses ridiculously little power --  it comes with a 36 watt power supply and probably uses around 24 watts in normal use, thanks to the thirfty LED backlighting.The only problem area is, LG apparently got a huge batch of very "cool" blue-tinted LED's for their backlight, because the colors are awful


Luckily my Macbook has an option in its color profiles to shift all colors towards the "warm" side of the scale, or I would have had to return this monitor
And it's not because of LED backlighting in general, my MacBook has an LED backlight too

LG just cheaped out on the LED's (it's *hard* to find a true white LED, and they're expensive).Oh, about the base -- there are various complaints on the web that the base is somehow "flimsy"
LG must have redesigned the base or something, because mine is big, round, heavy, and does its job well.

$review_text.: I installed 5 of these in the ceiling of a small family room as the primary speakers for my "secondary" home theatre

Along with a fairly cheap subwoofer, they are certainly more than acceptable -- and much better than I expected considering the price


If you're looking for cheap surround speakers or even a full set, and you're not an audiophile, I doubt you'll be disappointed
My only issue is with the directional tweeter that is basically a "bubble" in the center of the grill...the JBLs I have in my main system look much nicer as the grills are completely flat, without this "bump." Overall, though, highly recommended for home theatre on a budget.

$REVIEW.: Hi!The camera is very good.  Great color and exceptional lense  are features that make it a very good value.That was my initial reaction.Since it has been almost a year now I have to say I am very disapointed in Panasonics poor service after purchase.  Even attempting to get help on the official site is frusterating.  Matter of fact it is the poorest  I have encountered  anywhere.The site seems so easy to navigate but mysteriously changes when I go to cutomer support or the parts department.  I have filled out the contact page inumerous times only to click submit and have it do nothing.A piece fell off my camera. The piece is the one your right thumb uses to hold onto the camera.  I called the 800 number  for information.  Wanted the part number but nobody there even knows what the heck the camera looks like.  I was told someone would call me in three days and six days later I was still waiting.  Finally I called back and was given the national parts and warranty number. Spent 15 minutes on phone. most of it waiting for the rep to confirm that  the part number was right .  After ordering was told I would wait a month for delivery.A month! I got a hole in my camera! I can see electronics!A month later I receive the wrong part.  Completely wrong! They sent me the whole front body cover.  I need this little piece on the back.I tried writing and am now waiting again to ship back and reorder.This is a huge disapointment!I just purchased the FZ30 and although a great camera  I wish I had not because the support is terrible.  Seems like all they want to do is sell new stuff. That is so easy on their site.  But try to identify a part that should not have fallen off to began with and the service is the worst.They advertise lenses as accessories but they don't have them nor do their dealers carry them either.Panasonic has taken a loyal customer like me and made me completely disapointed.  And it sucks to be treated this way!

$REVIEW.: I've had this camera for a year now and love the style, build quality and how compact the unit is. If you search for more info on this camera you will see there is a white balance issue that is noticeable when panning an area with different lighting. Its the main drawback of this camera. There is also no remote and the zoom button is too delicate to get a even zoom without many takes. Only gets 3 stars for these reasons.

$review_text.: I am retired and just sold a Canon GL2 prosumer video camera.  I wanted something HD to throw in a drawer and use when I wanted something better than my P&S camera video.  The price was the selling point.  Lots of written complaints about the autofocus noise but unless you are playing the video with the sound up to max I don't think you won't be able to hear it.  I like the lack of tape and the size.  Took it to a Cowboy Action shoot this last weekend and it did great and kept the gunshots low and still recorded the voices. If I was thinking about doing a professional video I would have kept the GL2.  This takes decent video indoors and even in low light.  I think for the money it's a great camera.  Took a closeup of a flower in the garden and it was an awesome shot, great depth of field and color.  I have a remote mic that I can plug in which is an additional bonus.

$review_text.: This tripod for the price is incredible. I mainly use it for dslr shooting, but I'm sure it would shine with somewhat heavier cameras like the canon XF105 or maybe even XF305. The legs are very sturdy and the head is extremely smooth. My only complaint are the feet. They work fine on carpet, but can slip on most other surfaces. Besides that, this tripod includes all the things you'd expect on a professional tripod: counter balance, fluid head, leveling ball, etc.... As a final thought, BUY IT!

$REVIEW.: Pro:Better than the flimsy gummy case($19.95) that was all I could find when the tablet came out.Provides decent protection in the event of a short drop.At the time of purchase,  it was out of stock-but the price was $3.95 delivered. The price raised the rating by one star.It's tight and won't fall off.Lots of viewing, and holding options.Auto on and off upon closing cover-very handy.Cons.1.Was very, very tight. Had a hard time actually putting it on.2.Clasp is tight, and platic. Be careful if you are thinking about bending it just a hair.3.Speaking of that, I cracked a tab on the bottom (when I  landscape). I was going to prop the tablet at an angle using the notches provided in the cover. But, when I went to pop the bottom of the tablet out, the corners hung and actually caused the edge of my brand new Nexus 7FHD to pop open. I was able to click it back closed, and hope there is no future unseen damage.4. This is where I learned about the fragile plastic. Buying a case that allows me to prop up the tablet was the whole point. So I gently pulled on the offending tab to loosen it up a bit when it snapped. It did not fall off and will still protect the corner in a drop, and it certainly will not snag the corner of the tablet when trying to unfold it into a propped up position anymore. But it is now the opposite-very loose. BE CAREFUL.Overall for the money, unbeatable.  I have similar cases on my Note 10.1 and love it.(Fintie Clickbook series folio hardback) - was not available for the New Nexus at the time.Mark

Too bad they aren't more compact so I can take them along on my morning runs.

$REVIEW.: Pros:Creative Zen X-fi is not a bad MP3 player. It holds a lot and supports big SD cards. Sound quality is good and the enclosed earbuds are not bad. Screen is big and easy to see.  Battery life is very good for audio, fair for video. Unique feature for e-books- has progressive fast-forward so the longer you press the faster it goes. No pressing for ten minutes to find your spot. Bookmark feature works well and allows multiple marks, even in one story or song.Cons:Interface has 13 counter-intuitive buttons, only 4 are marked at all. Difficult to set and retrieve bookmarks and do other button pushing maneuvers. Buttons change use in different windows. Player defaults to Extras window for some reason, so to find a new song you have to push back, back, up, up, up, then a different button down, down to see list of items. Cumbersome.Bottom line: a good player for books or music (not videos) made difficult to use by clumsy interface.

$REVIEW.: After using a 50pack of Memorex successfully, I decided to give Sony a try based on the rave reviews.  I went through the first 15 discs off the top of the Sony stack before giving up.  Every disc aborted the burn process with a "Power Calibration Error".  Never saw this error before with the Memorex discs I had used.  I tried all the possible speeds (8x, 16x, 32x without any luck).  It could be an incompatibility with my DVD drive (it is a Memorex drive, after all), but I can find anything about the issue Googling, at least nothing that will fix it.Anyway, sounds like other folks have had better success so I would just avoid these if one is using a Memorex DVD 16X drive.

$REVIEW.: Even after a month of using this speaker dock, I am left asking - what does it really want to be?  Speaker dock, speaker clock, portable speakers?  It does a number of things right; but it does a number of other things just a bit off - it can do those things in a pinch, but is not really optimal.  If you are looking for a simple speaker dock for the middle of a room, with good sound and few other features - this would be a good selection.  On to the details:Be ye a portable boomer?Omni-directional speakers (really, speakers firing out of both sides of the unit) sound like a recipe for a nice portable speaker and the sound is good, warmer than many and has a decent top-end volume -- but I wouldn't call it a boom box and the 40 sound levels seems excessive (the bottom 10 are so low as to be almost inaudible).  Moreover, the speaker covers are a standard stretched fabric affair and make me want for some kind of carrying case and would require an extra degree of care when out and about.Be ye a speaker clock?It has clock and alarm functions, but as others have noted, they are spartan, middling affairs.  Moreover, with speakers firing out of both sides, placing the unit near a wall (does anyone put an alarm clock in the middle of a room?) seems to be a recipe for poor sound quality.  There's a reason why there are directional speakers.Be ye a speaker dock?Again with weird speaker set-up which would seem to dictate placement away from a wall.  The display is bright and clear - but only shows the clock or the volume level.  Also, as others have mentioned, the remote lacks a lot of functionality - so it really is mostly a true speaker dock - for the middle of your room - but not so distant that you won't get up to operate it.  It just seems to aspire to more.A few other points - it does not come with very many dock adapters and none of them are marked.  There is no way to dim the clock display as far as I know.  When mated to an iPhone, the volume decreases nicely with an incoming call - but it would be nice to be able to route the call through the speakers.-----I reviewed this item over two years ago, and although the unit may lack features compared to alternatives, the sound is quite good.  Placed in the center of a room to share some music, or used outside, paired with my projector to watch some baseball on the wall of the garage - the sound really shines.  I've upped my overall rating to four stars.

$review_text.: I like finally having a keyboard for my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Tablet.  This one is nicely built, small keyboard but large enough for my fingers (but then I have small hands).  It has one fluke that took me a while to figure out.  If you linger on some letters, a pop-up box of foreign ways to input that letter are offered to you. I realize now that this is actually a feature meant for people of other languages that use different characters with certain punctuation over some letters like an accent mark over the letter e.  Since the ad or documentation didn't say anything about that feature, and I didn't understand what was happening, I was about to return it.  At an electronics store I found someone that figured out that hesitating on one of those letters is what triggers that feature which is offering you those options.  Once I knew that, and concentrated on typing more smoothly, it rarely happens.Now I enjoy typing on it, other than that I don't like the way the apostrophe mark works with the function button, too hard to use for someone that uses lots of contractions. But that is a problem with many electronics keyboards I find.  In terms of the overall quality of the keyboard and case I would give it 5 stars, it's very nice and classy looking and durable I would say.
$review_summary.: Nice, once I figured it out, I like it now!

 You can find my exhaustive review here http://goo.gl/u9Gr39 
 I purchased these speakers to replace the factory Jensen speakers in my Bayliner 186 boat


 Installation could not have been simply


 The cut-out was the same size as the Jensen speakers, so all that I had to do is drill a few more holes around the perimeter


 The sound of these speakers is incredibly clear and since they're marine speakers, they made for a boat and can handle a a little but of water on them


 I also purchased the Kenwood receiver and replaced that to further maximize the boat stereo upgrade.

$review_text.: I like full frame cameras that have excellent picture and video quality*. That is definitely this camera. However, its not perfect. Would I recommend it? No.Here's why:1. The hardly acknowledged sensor issue. The sensor issue can get really bad. I was lucky to have only suffered about 1-3 spots and can clean it out, but it keeps returning. Nikon hardly acknowledged this problem until months and months of selling the D600. I have yet to verify if there was ever a fix for this.2. The "fix" is a new model dubbed the 610 with like 2 features that differ from this model but everybody knows its all about the fixed shutter to prevent spots. The value of the d600 has dropped and if previous owners want to trade, its gonna cost another $500-1000. Might as well have bought a d800. Real smooth business there, Nikon. Though my problems are minor compared to others, it feels like D600 owners have been rubbed the wrong way. I have concluded I will not buy another Nikon and am considering jumping to another brand. Just because of this.3.Crippling features that gives the D7000 an advantage over this camera such as slower flash sync speed, slower max shutter speed, and slower continuous burst rate. Why did I trade it?Ironically though, the body is built well. Mine feels more solid than the D3000, D5000, D80, D90, and D7000.*the potential for good image or video quality is pretty much ruined by spots. I start seeing them at least around f/5. I have a list of things to avoid shooting with this camera to save myself the trouble of trying to edit it:The skySunsetSunriseCloudsWaterWallsIf there were some sort of resolution that was agreeable, I would recommend this camera. It's a great camera for masochists. I do love my camera, no argument there, I just disagree with Nikon's direction in handling this whole fiasco. Bad business. Shame on you, Nikon.Final thoughts: Due the announcement of the D610, the price of the D600 has dropped dramatically. Therefore I cannot get any return value for my camera, and realized it is literally a dead weight. In an effort to get something for it, I have listed it on ebay as a paperweight for about 1/1000th of the price. Then I figured it would only put unwanted spots in someone's workspace and unlisted it to avoid bad customer feedback.

$REVIEW.: I needed a remote control to operate a Windows Media Center HTPC. Although I still have to use a wireless keyboard and mouse occasionally for more advanced actions this remote allows me to control the vast majority of functions needed for playing media. It has many function keys which allow it to be solely used to operate the computer. The direction pad mouse works adequately. I find in Media Center the direction key buttons works best, rather than using the mouse. I like there's a button for My PC. I click that and Windows Explorer opens and then i can use the direction keys rather than the direction pad to click on folders. Although I do have to click with mouse first before I can use the direction keys.The IR receiver isn't the best. You have to be sure to place it in a very visible location. I ran it out of the back of the PC and put it under the front of the TV. The cord could stand to be a few feet longer but for the price I won't be complaining and I of course could just purchase a USB extension .I found this remote to work immediately when I plugged it in to a Windows 7 64bit machine. I don't think I could use a HTPC without a remote. A remote makes the HTPC feel more like a consumer electronic device.It's a fantastic device for the price!

The leather feels soft, the magnet holds the case closed when not in use and the camera cut-out is large enough to not interfere with picture taking.

The driver installed automatically upon plugging it in but Windows kept saying the driver wasn't working right. When I would right-click on the adapter to enable it, it would momentarily enable and then go back to disabled. I didn't want to waste any more time on it and returned it. Even though I don't need an "N" adapter for this client I am ordering one for a better chance at Windows 7 compatibility.

$REVIEW.: This was purchased as a Christmas gift to showcase a lifetime of transferred images (about 800 vintage slides & photos).  The operating system on this frame is terrible.  It can't handle that many medium-density images, and will stall while loading them.The result for me was awkward long pauses with hopeful family members eventually becoming disinterested, as images took several minutes to load.The viewing angle of the screen is very narrow.  About like an old-school Passive Matrix Display from a laptop computer from the 1990's.The interface seems to be written by someone translating Engrish as a second language.UPDATE March 2013:It seems that the processor of this frame simply can't accommodate larger-sized photo files.  You can forget about its advertised overall memory capacity.  It simply takes far too long for dense photos to load up.  In our case, when there was a mix of moderate-sized and large-sized photos in a string, the big photo took up to ten minutes to load, while the smaller photo took as little as ten seconds to load.  Our net experience has been beyond frustrating, and this frame is not recommended for captive audiences.

$REVIEW.: I've owned this product for about 2 years now and have one each on a Canon D10 and D20 underwater camera.  This floatation device works great with both cameras.  I've used it in calm pools but also in the open ocean in Mexico and Hawaii.  The material has been durable but I make sure to rinse off the strap in clean tap water after using it in the pool and the ocean.  I was initally worried about the quick release at the attachment point but it is very sturdy with little risk of accidental attachment.  I've seen generic models that look very similar to this one at camera / electronic shops but I can't speak to their quality.  I'd pay to get the genuine Olympus brand.  It's a few dollars more and the alternative is having your expensive waterproof camera at the bottom of the ocean!

$REVIEW.: i bought this product based on it's reviews compared to other FM transmitters.  of course it's not as good as a direct line into your stereo (i.e.-Aux or equivalent) but for those of us that don't have that option, this is a pretty good alternative.my girlfriend has the FM Transmitter by Monster which is what i'm comparing it to, and while it's more expensive i notice less static with theMonster iCarPlay Plus Wireless FM Transmitter/Charger for iPodcompared to this one.  another small complaint i have is when powering up and switching channels on the unit.  i found the Monster cable to transmit to my radio much faster than the Kensington, leaving you less time to listen to static whine in between switching channels or when you first turn on your car.one other note: i don't find the orange backlit screen as bad as the others have commented and is actually quite easy to read at night or during the day.overall, i don't regret this purchase and would recommend it to those that don't want to spend the extra money on the Monster cable.

$REVIEW.: I've applied several screen protectors before, so I was aware of the pitfalls. The biggest issue I had with this one is that it wouldn't land straight on the iPad - no matter how hard I tried. (I ended up using both of them with the same results.)This meant that there was always a little bit of overhang that sat on top of the corner of the screen and that created a lifted spot. I ended up trimming off the corner a little bit to try to repair it. It doesn't look elegant, but the corner is covered by my iPad cover so it will do.The packaging was great and I was surprised to receive a piece of candy with my order! I really wanted to LOVE this one because I was so impressed with the way it was packaged and shipped.In my opinion, the screen cover could be a smidge narrower so that the difficulty I described could be avoided. But that's probably just me.The anti-glare properties work great. That's why I've decided to continue using it. It's done what I wanted it to do.
$SUMMARY.: Kind of hard to apply

$REVIEW.: The USG 50 is a nice step up from the typical home/office routers I've owned in the past. I purchased this device because the D-Link  wireless router I had installed in my restaurant appeared overwhelmed with the traffic created by my guests and the 12 IP cams on my network. I needed to reboot the D-Link unit each morning. I've yet to reboot the USG 50 in over a month.The big difference between this device and the typical router is the incredible flexibility, multiple wired networks, multiple WANS  and much improved security it offers. The down side to all this a much more difficult setup. I was very well versed in setting up Netgear, D-Link and Linksys routers, but this device is much more complicated and confusing to setup compared to the others. If like me, you're  comfortable with these other small office/home routers, be prepared for a bit of a learning curve.Once you begin to understand the different configuration routine, the device becomes much easier to use and configure.PROS:Reasonable price for features/build quality.Good built-in security features.Offers incredible flexibility for multiple LANS/WANS and VPN settings.Very strong tech support from ZyXEL.Handles much more data, users and different networks compared to other, less capable devices.CONS:Difficult to configure for the average person.Some features work only for 30 days (Trial versions of ADP, content filter, anti-spam, anti-virus and IDP signature)After a month of problem free usage, I decided to purchase another sample for my second location.The few calls I placed to ZyXEL were answered fairly quickly with competent staff on the other end.Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase and would recommend this unit to others.

$review_text.: I just got a couple of these 3TB WD Red drives a week ago!  If you want some nice drives for your NAS these are it!  Recommended for 1 to 5 drive bay systems.  My new NAS has 4 bays so I'm using 2 of them right now.  Formatted you get 2.7TB from them!  You want a HDD that is guaranteed to support a NAS, these WD Red drive are them!!!The are Basically Green drives and yet so much more!  They are much faster yet use less Power then other drives and have less heat.  They also have a 3 year warranty and their own phone number to call if you have any problems.  So the little  higher price is worth the longer warranty of these over the other drives.  These have software designed to work in a NAS environment that other HDD can have issues with!NAS's are a fast growing market right now I think.  Since they need Hard Drives, I'm surprised WD is the only ones out with these RED NAS drives.  I'm sure others are working on their own versions for this growing market.  If you want to sell HDD's, especially the 3.5" ones, because Laptops and whatnot is the growing market and they take 2.5" drives or going with SSD drives.Both of my drives worked problem free.  Just mounted to the frames and popped them into my NAS and the NAS did the rest on it's own.  Simple easy!!!  Lower power saves you money in electricity over the years using it and less heat means longer lasting drives!  How can you go wrong?So how do these really stack up in Comparison to other HDD?  Well when it comes to Hardware Reviews everyone knows anandtech.com right!  Check it out.[...]Toms Hardware is also another great review site.  Check out their review of these Red drives![...]Update 5-21-2013I've now had these 2 WD Red 3TB drives for a number of months and so far they've been working out great in my NAS unit.  In fact I just ordered a 3rd one just now as I have room for up to 4 drives.  If you have a NAS, THESE are the drives to get.  Don't even waste your time on the 1 and 2 Gig versions, get these 3 Gig RED's!!!  I'll see how it works out with my NAS as it goes from RAID 1 to Raid 5 mode.  It'll be nice to have some breathing room again with this 3rd HHD.

$REVIEW.: I love this case. I love the style. It looks cool. When I took my iPad to the Apple store, the guy working there said &#34;wow what a cool case. It looks so futuristic!&#34; As far as looks go, I cannot complain.Let's talk protection. I've had this baby on my $800+ iPad Air for several weeks now and I am nothing if not a hurricane on legs. Not to mention, single mother to a five year old who is equally unstable. So you can imagine this thing has been dropped, thrown, stepped on, had stuff spilled on it, and so on and so forth. And the iPad... still as beautiful and scratch-free as the day I bought it. Talk about tough. This case is absolutely amazing. I feel confident taking my iPad anywhere and letting other people touch it without cringing because I know that it is safe in its case. This baby can take - and has taken - quite a beating. For strength and beauty, I would not trade it for anythingSo why four stars, you ask. Here's why. I put my iPad on my desk in front of me thinking it would act like a laptop with the keyboard on it. I tilt the iPad screen to the right angle to use and *bam* it falls over. I know, I know, the iPad is heavier than the keyboard and obviously it won't hold. This is a clear inconvenience that I had not considered. Yes, I understand that they wanted to make the detachable keyboard super lightweight and they definitely succeeded there. But the other piece of the case is much heavier and is attached to the iPad which is even heavier. Alll that weight on one side with so little weight on the other means you can't possibly use the iPad as a laptop. This makes typing on it very difficult. There does not seem to be any way to twist and turn the iPad in a position where it actually stands upright in a comfortable position for typing. You can make it stand up but then the screen is at an uncomfortable angle for typing or the screen rests on the keyboard, covering some of the keys. No matter how I then it, I cannot seem to get the ideal angle. So I gave up on using the keyboard. I purchased a MacBook Air for my laptop needs and use the iPad Air as an iPad. I basically just use the keyboard part as a stand so my iPad stands upright while I am watching shows or movies or anything which doesn't require touching the screen. Because as soon as the screen is touched, the whole setup goes down.So, if you want a case that will turn your iPad into a mini laptop, look somewhere else. This one does not work like that. It was very disappointing because I really was hoping it would work. However, I kept it because of the high level of protection. For the price, this little beauty will protect your investment and look good doing it. So despite its faults, I still love it. My old iPad was so full of scratches and cracks that it was unrecognizable and cost $200 to fix. I bought a kid proof case for $20 and gave it to my daughter. But for this one, I wasn't taking any chances.Long story short - it is gorgeous, a great value to protect your investment, but a failure as far as keeping your iPad upright or using the attached keyboard. Detaching the keyboard isn't so great either because the piece attached to the other side just hangs there and doesn't seem to serve any purpose. Buy this if you want beauty and protection only.
$review_summary.: Beautiful case, top quality protection, doesn't work as a stand and keyboard mostly useless

$REVIEW.: I recently reviewed products that use your houses electrical wires for Internet access, such as from your modem to your tv for netflix access. This is really intuitive though. Rather than be forced to either go through the labor intensive process of installing ceiling speakers or have any extra speakers at all to clutter up your room, this genius idea installs speakers in any room you want and maintains use as a light as well. We've been playing music from our ipod Touch all day while patching drywall holes in our new home. The music is sufficiently loud for a quiet home or office, but don't plan on using it for a large party. The only complaint is that the light itself is not very bright, the equivalent of a 60 watt. I also wonder how long the lightbulb will last and what it will take to replace it, as this main unit is the only one currently on the market, with replacement yet to be available.4.5 stars, and well worth the savings. Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: I haven't had this product for long yet, but I've played around with it a little, and also took it on a recent trip to a family gathering.  I've used the device so far to share out an SD card, and to transfer files around between my android tablet (Xoom gen 1 - 4G/LTE running stock 4.0.4) and my cellphone (Samsung Galaxy Nexus running stock 4.2.2).  The Airstor app works as expected, although the design elements and functionality are a bit rudimentary.  Movie watching is through the Airstor app, and does indeed function fairly well to at least two separate devices simultaneously.I also, as mentioned, took it to a recent family gathering (where people were suitably impressed with it's capabilities) - I used it to transfer photos from my cousin's SD card to my cellphone, and the transfer of the 2+GB of photos went smoothly and quickly.  One small catch I hit here:  During the transfer of the files to my phone, I accidentally clicked on something within the app that caused the file transfer status window to disappear.  I was unable to figure out how to get it to show up again, and thought maybe it had been cancelled -- so I started it up again, and then discovered that I'd actually doubled the transfer request of all the files.  When it hit the duplicate files, it did properly ask me if I wanted to overwrite the file on my device or not, but there was no obvious way to cancel the rest of the job (although I did finally manage to get it to stop).I haven't been able to test out the battery life when sharing, nor it's device recharging capabilities yet - but I'm going on another trip in a few weeks, where I'll be putting it through it's paces much harder, and will update my review with any meaningful news.I gave this 4 out of 5 stars, mostly because the Airstor app is still a bit unpolished, but I expect (hope) that they'll continue to make that app better over time.  That said, the app does work as it should, and I have no qualms about saying that this device is well worth the money![UPDATE: June 2013]An update / warning:  I took this on another trip (to Alaska), and hit a limitation of this unit (RP-WD01) regarding the number files that it can handle on an SD card at one go.  When using my T3i with a 128MB SDXC UHS-1 Class 10 card (SanDisk Extreme), I ended up with around 5000 photo files (a mix of JPG and RAW), and was unable to view the photos on my android tablet after an unspecified pint.  I know that the unit can handle this mixture of file types and the card itself (having used it earlier with fewer photos on the device) - but when I tried later, the software would spin for a while when trying to read the card, and then finally just give up.  I'll try and test out what the number limit is, if I can...
$SUMMARY.: So far, so good

$review_text.: I really can't complain considering the price paid, but just a couple of things to consider for prospective buyers..1. Not really well padded inside, but still the semi hard outer case should protect your GPS well for storing it in a glovebox or console...or carrying in a jacket pocket.2. The stretchy "bellows" that prevent the clamshell from fully opening can sometimes bow out and have to be pushed back in with your finger before zipping up.3. The zipper can sometimes stick a little when going around the corners...not too bad though.Other than those minor issues, this case does what it's supposed to...and for the asking price you really can't expect more than that.

$REVIEW.: Personally I think this little ZyWall works great. It has loads of features, configuration, and is overall a good small business product or even for a small office at home. I was able to configure the device with a little research as the advanced features are sometimes very in-depth.  Of course you should expect that from a device like this. I purchased it for IPSEC and SSL VPN which worked fine for me. However do to software vendor requirements and not being supported product I had to return the device as they would not give full support for the software if we had this device inline. I am really disappointed in software vendors require such stupid requirements. This device is way more capable then the Sonic Wall device we had to put it. I just don't understand why they would accept this device. I almost thought of keeping it for myself. Great Product.
$SUMMARY.: Awesome device - Check with your software vendors for support

$review_text.: This mouse is a very bad replacement for the MX1000. The bottom line is that unless you have NFL or NBA sized hands it's terrible to use. The mouse is very large, sits high, and has a palm arc that's almost a quarter inch taller than my old MX1000. Basically it feels like my hand is always falling off the back of the mouse and the front buttons are hard to reach. The extra height also irritates my wrist and forearm. The only nice thing I can say about the 1100 is that it has extra large mouse feet that make it glide easily. Wish I could find a new MX1000 or Logitech bring it back.

$review_text.: I love reviews that destroy a product simply because people don't take the necessary precautions nor time to figure out something for themselves. Any phone that requires this adapter obviously should be used with a standard SIM card...and if you use anything else you are assuming some responsibility for your device and any subsequent failure.But, I digress and stand down from the soapbox.These work. They do what they are supposed to and don't take a enormous amount of time, effort nor thought to use properly.And...to remove them, take a moment, study your device and...wait for it...BE SMART.Here is the problem most people seem to be having: The contact pins in many phones were designed to accept a standard SIM. With this in mind the adapter (any adapter) cannot make up for the small gap that will exist between the SIM and the adapter itself. I don't care what you use or do, this is not something that can be helped.So here is the safe way to remove the device from most phones. Obviously I only have a limited number of phones I can test this on and you should take some time to study your particular device to see if this will work. I take no responsibility for any problems.Cut a small piece of plastic longer than a SIM but close to the same width. I used a piece of screen protector film with the peel away backing still in place. Such a film is flexible and thin enough to slide between the SIM and the contact pins. You need something this thin because you are going to use it to help assist your SIM with adapter into place and out of your phone if you are removing it.The idea is simple: use this film to push down the pins and to provide a safe insertion and removal. For my wife's blackberry and Galaxy Note I placed the thin piece of film into the SIM slot. Then I inserted the SIM and removed the film. This ensures that the SIM is seated properly in the phone. If you want to remove the SIM you simply insert the film BENEATH the SIM card, push all the way to make sure it is under the SIM completely and between the SIM and the contact pins. Gently remove your SIM while keeping the film in place. Do this right and your card won't rip the contact pins from your phone.Not brain surgery. Just a few moments of thought.
$SUMMARY.: They work..With a 2nd grade IQ you can remove them too! READ FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON REMOVAL

$REVIEW.: Considering the price on this unit I have to say this one stands out very nicely and operates just as it should. I purchased this to replace a Lorex system I had where the remote control was whacked out after a few weeks so this one is hands down much better.  If you think about this system for what it is you have to realize it's a pretty good deal for what it does.Two cameras and small monitor are just fine, for the price there are pretty darn good deal.  As far as Tech Support, that doesn't sway me one way or the other, these days "NO ONE" has any tech support worth the powder to blow them out of the water anyway so you cannot rely on them or what they pretend to know. Today if you don't know it yourself you simply should not buy it. Tech support is generally some people hired off the street with manuals divided into Branch Type problem solving, "Problem "A" = Turn To This Page --- Problem "B" = Turn To The Other Page, that's it, a pre-printed problem solving manual with no technical savvy behind it.None of them have true technical knowledge, you can't single out Uniden, they are all the same way - crude. I had one exception for a garage door opener provided by Buick (Home-Link) I think was there name, the Tech Support people for HomeLink Tech Support actually knew the product and had the answers (thank you Buick & HomeLink) but they were an exception.* When I bought this my thinking was as follows:(1) STAND ALONE UNIT not tying up my computer - I have too much connected to the computers as it is, this system does not need a computer to operate, thank God for that. Leave my computer alone already and let me use it for other things.(2) SIMPLE OPERATION, it works easily and does not have to be routed through several systems before I can get an image of someone at my door. My wife hates to learn a million new techno pages every time something comes out, cell phones, programmable refrigerator - washers - coffee makers - entertainment systems - i-Tunes (changes every week) - printers - answering machine - copiers - gee wiz man it doesn't end does it, a new techno manual for everything. It was nice to see a straight forward setup easy to use which my wife (or me) can operate without being frustrated for an hour.I am pretty tech savvy and I'm the Go To Guy in the neighborhood for any technical things so getting a break on this was nice to see.(3)  No Wires - (of course the cameras have power wires), nice to know I didn't have to drill and run wires all over the house for an afternoon and then listen to how to dam wires show here and there and blah-blah-blah...., this is a very Big Plus.For house security this is a good basic system that simply does the job, they have better technology coming out all the time but for what it is this is nice with some solid positive features. If you think it through before you tackle the setup it should go easy with little or no frustration.  I have been running mine for a over one year and it's been fine.The newer one they came out with has features I like a lot but I'll stick with this one for now, I could end up buying one every six months the way new technology goes.For under $300 you should not expect HDTV and Surround Sound but for the price this is tough to beat, it has operated just as they say and so far so good.Again - for the money you'll be hard pressed to find one better, maybe the Uniden UDS655 (hahaha, another very nice unit with nice options - maybe nicer - hehehe.... look at that one too.)I just installed the Uniden USD655 for a neighbor and that one is pretty darn nice, pretty darn nice indeed.Uniden UDS655 7-Inch Video Surveillance with 2 Outdoor Cameras and 4GB MicroSD CardYup this one is nice too - sure is.

$review_text.: I had this in the box for 3 weeks before I opened it. I was considering returning it because of so many negative reviews. I went ahead and tried it.  I did not immediately hook it up to the computer. I just used it out of the box. It worked GREAT!  You can pick car color and type, which is fun.  It is so easy to program. It remembers recent destinations, which is nice.  I love the red line it gives you for the road to follow with arrows.  When exiting, it gives you a giant yellow arrow so there is no confusion as to which lane to take.  If you take a different turn than it recommends, it quickly recalculates.  You can pick different type voices.  I did, after a week, decide to hook it up to the computer. It did update my maps, with no problems whatsoever.  It didn't say full or anything. (Which  am glad because I do not know how to delete voices or things I do not need on there.) I can't say one bad thing about it. I haven't tried traffic, but not worried too much about that feature. So glad I tried it out. Has alot of fun features. Super easy to see. Set up instructions are very detailed and I recommend going thru it since it basically shows you the features. Would buy again!!!

$REVIEW.: Whenever I need a usb hub for anything I always buy this exact model. I've been using these for years. I've used a lot of these and I have only ever seen one go out (after like two years of use). It doesn't require an external power supply to function either.I've never had any problems with it's speed even though it's USB 2.0.It works with Windows, Linux and OSX and it would probably work with other Oses since it's such a standard thing.You can plug phones, external hard drives, flash drives, USB refrigerators, more usb hubs or really anything just remotely compatible with usb into it. I've taken these apart for use in custom tablets before by soldering them to the motherboard. At one point I was even using one to power components in an unmanned airplane.As far as usb 2.0 hubs go, this is the best. It's also more reliable than any usb 3.0 hub.If they would just make a usb 3.0 version of this that's the same size, that would be great.

$review_text.: MyBelkin N150 Wireless N Router (Latest Generation)had been dropping signals and generally not acting as zippy as I'd like for months


 When I attempted to get the AirPrint function on my newEpson WorkForce 545 Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer, Copier, Scanner, Fax, iOS/Tablet/Smartphone/AirPrint Compatible (C11CB88201)for hours to no avail, it was the last straw.I was torn between theBelkin N900 Dual-Band Wireless N Router + Gigabit (Latest Generation)which seemed like overkill, but would keep me in good shape for years to come, this one, and theBelkin N450 Wireless Dual-Band N+ Router (Latest Generation)
 I'd looked too at Linksys routers, but Belkin had been so good to me for the past 3 years with easy set-up and solid function, I didn't want to mess with success.Ultimately it came down to price versus features

 I went with the N750 because it offered speeds up to 450megs with a dual (2.4Ghz/5Ghz) channel availability

 The N900 was nearly twice the price and the feature boost was minimal, so I saved myself some money instead


 The N450 went up to 300megs and lacked features the N750 has including usb 2.0 ports, media server capabilities and wireless printing.Other features like QoS - uninterupted high speed streaming for videos and gaming, was immediately noticable when using our Roku to stream Amazon Instant Videos.The pre-set security options are great on this router, but be sure you set up your own network password to lock down the settings from hackers
Note each setting has a question mark by it


 Click it to see an explanation of the setting and what it does - very helpful, and allows you to make your network secure and how you want it to be for your needs.I have about 10-12 devices using my network at any given time

 This router gave the network a much needed upgrade and helps us to enjoy our high-speed Internet to its fullest potential.The issue I'd been having with AirPrint not working between my iPad and the WorkForce 545 was resolved with this router, and all of my devices: Roku, iPad, iTouch, PCs running Windows 7 and Windows 8 64-bit, all easily gained network access.Truly I got so much more than I expected with this router, and am very pleased with its performance and features thus far.I especially like that with 2 USB ports, this router can act as a secure media server to my entire network when I attach mySeagate Backup Plus 3 TB USB 3.0 Desktop External Hard Drive (STCA3000101)or similar drive.The Parental Controls for this router are also great

 I set mine up on the medium security setting (blocking potential malware and adult content sites) and found it also blocks email attachment links with those things on them
 A bonus that doesn't require additional security suite protection via software.I'm delighted to recommend this one to anyone who wants to get maximum enjoyment, security and stability from their home network, for under $100.

$review_text.: Wow, is Amazon going to be sorry that they asked me to write a review on this product!!  This camera is such a disappointing piece of junk that we returned it.  Upon further research on the internet, we found that we were one of many people whose XTi produced photos that were incredibly dark and underexposed, even though we bought and used the Canon EX430 Flash with it.  Sent some photos to Canon, and they confirmed that camera was defective.  We then went to [..]and bought another XTi, only to have the same results.  Sent some of that camera's photos to Canon, and they again said the camera was not working correctly!  Their tech supervisor told us that the "green box" fully automatic setting is just a marketing ploy and this model is really incapable of taking a good photo when set on full automatic settings.  Why could my film SLR take an excellent photo on auto focus, auto shutter, auto aperature, etc.?  Don't buy this piece of junk!!

$REVIEW.: The LGP does exactly what I wanted: Records video without needing to be plugged into a PC.  I'm using it to record VJ sessions, not video games, so I really needed something portable and quick, and the LGP delivers!  Once you get everything set correctly, it's beautiful, one-touch recording.But getting everything set correctly is a challenge.  There is a lot of fiddling you have to do before PC-free mode will work, and most of it's undocumented.  Mostly it's about using the PC-Free utility to set the LGP, and making sure your output device is set to the right resolution.  AVerMedia has suprisingly terrific customer support, and they did a great job of answering my questions, but be aware that you might have to contact them before everything works the way you want it to.

$REVIEW.: I was studying for a bluetooth product that can hook up with my Iphone and used in car conveniently. I stumbled across various products but I finalized and found that Motorola products offered the best. Though there are other brands that does it jobs as well. I personally like this model of Motorola product as it is small in design and appeared to be stylish.1. The pairing was effortless. Quick and simple and easy.2. The sounds quality was good. Clear and crisp. Though I am still able to figure out a person is on this bluetooth device during phone conversation when I tried out with my wife.3. The FM modular is working as per intended.I don't fancy the FM modular very much as firstly one need to search for a station and the station frequency cannot be fixed.Secondly the quality through FM is always inferior.I prefer a aux-bluetooth device for music.Anyway, this is a good product. Battery life is good about 1-2 weeks depending on usage.

$review_text.: I purchased this item (not from Amazon) and ended up returning it

The "circuit breaker" disclaimer is a bit misleading

Most modern homes and apartments have either single or 3-phase wiring

What this means is that in a single phase installation (typical of most residential buildings of less than 10 units)is that there are two separate "hot" wirees from the street
If you have a 220volt device, the socket contains a wire from each of the two hot lines


A 125v device is connected to only one
A typical single phase breaker box alternates hot leads
The top breaker is from lead 1, the next down is from lead 2, etc.What this means is that you have a 50% chance that the powerline adapter is on the same hot lead as the receiver


If you are lucky and the receiver and transmitter are on the same hot lead, the system will work


If you are on the other lead, it won't
In a 3-phase breaker box, there are 3 hot leads so your odds go down to 1 in 3.There is a way it appears to make this work if you really need to

Run a network line to near your breaker box

Install an AC outlet on each of the hot leads (this usually needs an electrician)


Get a small 4-port switch and buy an adapter for each of the hot lines


Then connect each of the new outlets to a transmitter


Here's the bad news


There is no guarantee that the transmitters won't interfere with each other.I ended up running network wiring to each room
While this powerline solution seems useful, it will only work under very restricted conditions.

$REVIEW.: I just got this camera for my trip to Hawaii


It came in two days (prime member) as promised by Amazon


I had no idea how the pictures and video would come out

It far exceeded my wildest dreams

The video is easy to use; has so many settings on it, that it worked great outside, inside and underwater
I am not that technology gifted, and I could use it easily

It is totally waterproof

Believe me, I had my doubts, and sure enough, it took fantastic underwater pictures
My friends couldn't believe that they were real

I took beautiful pictures of scenery and pictures of my friends and this camera is truly amazing

The zoom is wonderful, and the pictures are clear.I upgraded my memory card to a 32GB and had no problem with taking over 200 pictures and many videos
I also bought the Wasabi battery charger with extra batteries


I would recommend that if you are going on a trip.It is a little heavier than your quick aim and shoot cameras, but then again, it takes amazing pictures and is waterproof


I used the underwater setting, which uses the flash and my pics are perfect
In clear water and bright sunshine, you probably don't need the flash, but it was recommended by our captain on our snorkeling cruise.I bought the Chum float so I wouldn't lose my camera if I accidentally dropped it under the water in the ocean


It supported my camera fine


I also bought a strap to attach it to my float, and had no problem swimming anywhere with the current


I did not use the strap that came with it

Wish it would have had a normal camera strap and case.Pentax had them on back order, and didn't know when they could ship one


Amazon had them in stock for a great price.I LOVE THIS CAMERA AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!

There is a whole in the case for the micro usb cable.Yes, (2) is true, you can technically close the case while the micro usb cable is plugged in.Okay, here's the problem
The micro-usb flap/cover is designed to be &#34;pulled out&#34; on the Xperia Z Ultra, but designed to &#34;spin around one end&#34; on the Xperia Z Tablet.Thus, for an Xperia Z Ultra case, you can &#34;pull&#34; the micro-usb flap/cover through the opening in the cover.However, for an Xperia Z Tablet, you can NOT &#34;pull&#34; the micro-usb flap/cover through the hole in the cover

Why? Because the micro usb flap/cover is designed to &#34;spin&#34; around one end point of the Xperia Z Tablet.Now, for this particular case, you have two parts:(1) an outside &#34;leather-like&#34; case and(2) an inner plastic case where the Xperia Z Tablet sitsWhen you try to charge via micro-usb and close the case, what happens is:the micro-usb flip/cover is going to rotate around an end point, be hinged on the inner plastic case -- and when you try to close the cover, it'll put this unnatural pressure on the end of the micro-usb flip/cover (as if pulling it out)I don't see the micro-usb flap/cover lasting long under this stress.

Their website indicates that the NEX lenses are &#34;Compatible&#34; but in using them, you are using less than 50% of the area of the full frame sensor.  So why pay more than twice the price for full frame sensor that you won't use?  Mysterious&#8230;  I had a very difficult time figuring out this camera system.  I spent over an hour on Sony chat line and they could not tell me which lenses are full frame.  They kept directing me to a list on the a7R webpage that indicates that there are about 20 compatible lenses, but compatible list contains about 90% APS-C format lenses.  Beware before you buy.

It is a battle that will never be won.They have redone the pads on these and they are very comfortable now. I wear these on six hour stretches without any aches on my ears. They fit like a nice pair of fuzzy winter ear muffs and they just feed GOOD.The music I listen to the most is metal, with some trance and industrial tossed in. They hold up perfectly through all genres. The low end for bass may be lacking if you're in to brain melting lows of some hip-hop and dub. For that, you probably wouldn't be looking at an open air headphone anyways, you would be going closed. The mid range bass does sound excellent, and if you often had a hard time discerning a bass guitar from the drummer, you wont anymore. They become very clear and separate through a set of Grados.My only complaint is the build quality doesn't feel "high end". There is a lot of plastic here, which doesn't really hinder the sound at all, but it does effect the overall aesthetics. As you work your way up the line, they go from plastic to wood.In anycase, for sound alone, you will not be disappointed.

$review_text.: It's shameful to admit but I use headphones to listen to podcasts in my truck


To be fair it's only on back country roads I have driven a thousand times in the wee hours of the morning
I triedUltimate Ears Super.fi 5 Pro Earphones (Black)that plug into your ears and seal, they have superior sound but I like to hear what's going on around me


Then I tried the BOSE (R) In-Ear Stereo Headphones the sound wasn't as good but didn't seal


Problem was they didn't stay in and the little tips kept falling off and getting lost.These Sennheiser Sport lines are great
they kind of pull when you turn your head but seem to get better with use, and never fall off

They don't cover the ear canal so I can hear my surroundings and they sound great.

$REVIEW.: I grabbed thisSony16GB SDHC UHS-1 Class 10 Memory Card (SF16UX/TQN)during an Amazon Gold Box deal. Prior to this purchase, I already own many class-10 cards sold under different brand names, including Sandisk, HP, Transcend, PNY, etc. So I wanted to see how this Sony card stacks up against other brands.I tested this card using theTranscend RDF5 USB 3.0 Card Readerconnected to my computer's USB 2.0 port. The following is a summary of Sequential Write speeds (as reported by "CrystalDiskMark 3.01") for my class-10 SDHC cards, listed from fastest to slowest:-HP class-10 CG790A: 29.7MB/s-Sony UHS SF16UX/TQN(this product): 29.1MB/s &lt;-- [See update below]-Transcend UHS TS32GSDHC10U1E: 29.0MB/s-Transcend class-10 TS16GSDHC10E: 16.7MB/s-SanDisk Ultra class-10 DSDU-032G-AFFP: 12.7MB/s-Toshiba class-10 THNSH032GTRT: 12.0MB/s(See the comparison chart I uploaded to 'Customer Images' section)To qualify as a 'class-10', a SD card only has to sustain sequential-write speed of 10MB per second. As can be seem from the above, the fastest three cards (HP, Sony and Transcend) all exceed this requirement by nearly 3X. One thing I noticed is that they have essentially the same read/write speed, which suggests the top speed is limited by the USB 2.0 port of my computer.Of course, the REAL benchmark needs to be done in the actual application. For that, I inserted each card in my Canon Rebel T1i DSLR camera, set it to save both RAW and JPEG formats, then took 10 consecutive shots in burst mode. The Sony card wins this round 'by a nose'. It took only 15.6 sec to save all 250MB of data in my camera, The Transcend and HP cards are close behind, finishing in 16.2 and 16.7 sec, respectively. In contrast, the Sandisk Ultra took much longer at 23.8s, even though it also qualifies as a class-10.It should be noted that my DSLR camera is fairly old (2009), so it is unable to take full advantage of UHS-1 cards. If you have a modern high-end DSLR, the Sony card should perform even faster. But the speed difference will only be noticeable if you save your image files in RAW format (~25MB each) and also shoot in burst mode. For most people who save in JPEG format (~5MB each), they will most likely never notice any slow down caused by memory card.Bottom Line:This Sony UHS1 SDHC card is among the fastest class-10/UHS-1 cards I have ever tested. Unfortunately, since I don't have an USB 3.0 port, I am unable to unlock its full potential. I still consider it a great value, especially at the deal price I paid (around $1 per GB). But in case this item is not on sale, you may want to consider either the Transcend UHS or HP class-10 card, which are just as fast when used in USB 2.0 mode.Other notes:- The capacity of this '16GB' Sony card, as reported by my computer, is only 15.0GB. This is actually normal because computer people count one Gig as "2 to the power 30", which is 7.3% larger than one billion. So 15.0GB translates to over 16.1 billion bytes, which is '16GB' according to marketing people.- My card has "Made in Taiwan" printed on the back.- The card comes without any storage cases.- On the package there is an offer to download a free "Memory Card File Rescue" program from Sony web site. I don't see it as very useful since it allegedly does not work with non-Sony memory cards.[Update on Dec 26, 2013]I re-tested the same Sony UHS card on an USB 3.0 port, and observed a huge boost in both Read and Write speed:- Sequential Read = 90.2MB/s (was 34.8MB/s)- Sequential Write = 46.7MB/s (was 29.1MB/s)
$review_summary.: Excellent for saving RAW image files in burst mode - if your DSLR supports UHS mode

$REVIEW.: I just purchased a Canon Vixia and I have to say even though I read the reviews here first I now understand what the others were talking about but I would like to add in a bit more than wasn't discussed


The Camcorder has a terrible battery life

I recorded maybe a 15 minute long video (actually it was less than that) but the Camera battery was drained
It didn't die on me but it was hinting it needed to be recharged

That is an absolute terrible battery life for a camera and almost seems like a joke


The camera isn't useful unless you have a longer life battery or an extension cord with a very long cable to keep this plugged into your wall socket at all times


The camera life is completely impractical for recording anything other than a very short youtube video.That so far is the biggest complaint I have about the camera because it's as though it's punishing you if you want to use it

The touch interface is nice and the camera is light and simple to work with BUT, this is the breaking deal with this camcorder, and that is the software it uses.The Canon Camcorders use a program called Pixelia that comes with a Transfer utility and video browser that are beyond problematic


I've spent 2 days trying to get the program to recognize the camera or even the memory card but it simply does not comply


You can go to the Pixelia website and try to download the software but you need a serial number and if you think the one that came with your camera will work think again it does not


The software is such a frustration to use that it isn't at all worth the hassle.So to give you an idea of what I mean here is an example


You can have the HF R300 connected to your computer and your computer will recognize it, the camcorder itself with state that there is a connection BUT, as soon as you click the load feature in Pixelia Transfer Utility you will get the same "No camcorder or memory card detected" over and over again
Uninstall, reinstall, it is a problem with no given solution
I tried to work around it and just upload the video from the card directly


It worked partially as it recognized the card but did not find a video on the card? However, I was able to locate the video on the card through Windows My computer


So where is the flaw when the computer is doing it's part but the software will not recognize the device it is designed to be used with?I thought this was an isolated issue and just my poor luck but as I dug further I found out more about how problematic Pixelia's software can be


I'm familiar with Nikon's software and I've never had these problems with cameras
I own a Kodak and never had that problem uploading images, I even have a Canon printer and never had software problems but for some reason Canon's Pixelia Video software is unbelievably problematic


I've decided to take the camera back to the store and go with a camera from a different brand

It is actually that frustrating to deal with when the problem is not a user error but a program issue.All I can say is that the software is what cost Canon a purchase for their Camera

The camera itself is actually very nice despite the power problems but recording a video and being stuck with it on a memory card and no way of transferring it or uploading it is pointless

There are free programs and some paid programs you can use to transfer you videos directly off the card and edit them but way pay extra money or go through the back route work just to fix what a manufacturer should have been aware of from the start?Overall if you're deciding on buying this Camera be prepared to have an alternative for the short battery life and program upload/editing software


If you're already set with software by means of 3rd party and don't mind shilling out a few extra coins for an extended life battery I think you will have a good camera


It's just a shame it's crippled by poor manufacturing choices.

$REVIEW.: The Motorola S11 Flex does everything it says it does

 It has an awesome style, the volume level is sufficient when biking fast, the button layout is easy and intuitive, and it is comfortable over long distances
 The ability to receive and even make calls using voice commands is a great addition
 I have noticed that when biking at high speeds, it may not recognize your voice command, but I was pretty much expecting that.I have an average size head and although I do notice that it fits tightly, I think that is almost essential, especially when playing sports, because you don't want it falling off on you


 I have not noticed it being overly tight (as some reviewers have said) to it being painful or uncomfortable.Overall, I love these headphones and think that Motorola did a great job in the design and functionality


 I would certainly recommend them for music / receiving calls while running, biking, rollerblading or playing any other moderately active sports.

$review_text.: When the Kindle Fire came out, I ordered a number of different cases because I really wanted to compare and find the right one for me. What I found out is that this case shared the exact same design as the "Elsse (TM) Premium Folio Case for Kindle Fire Cover - Black" which is also available on Amazon.The only real difference between the two models is that this one was packaged more like a retail product and had slightly better materials than the Elsse model. They both worked well for a carrying case, and the magnetic lock was solid. But for a stand, I was disappointed in the landscape positions it could do, and it could not reasonably be used as a stand in portrait mode.If all you are looking for is a carrying case, this may be good enough. I ended up quickly wanting something better.

$REVIEW.: This is one of the first hard drives I have seen that offers easy use between PC and Mac. I have several windows based systems, but I use Macs from time to time through work so it was very refreshing to not have to carry around two separate drives. Given it's storage capacity, it is fairly small. Fits easily in my backpack with my 17.3" laptop and I hardly notice it's there. It has the look and feel of quality and I really like the grippy texture that is becoming more popular with high end PC peripherals. It's just that extra bit of security that the drive won't slip from my hands. When it's on, it's barely audible next to my very quiet laptop and I can't hear it at all over the roar of my PC fans. It is always lukewarm to the touch when in use which is very welcome since one of my older drives (a 10 year old 500GB Western Digital) gets very very warm after only a short time and does give me concern for how long it will last. Luckily that drive is a back up of a back up of a back up! It's not the most portable system as there are models out there that are more stylized and compact, but you also pay a much higher price. I'm not looking for style, and the size is fine for my uses so no complaints here. I really like that it turns itself off when the PC or Mac is turned off as most older (and even some newer ones) hard drives do not have this feature and will just run on and on and on until you remember to turn them off. Quite a pain for some models that don't have a light or any other indicator to tell you they are on. The hard drive comes setup for use with a Mac but it's simple to prepare it for use between both Mac and PC. For the price, I think this is a fine choice for storage even if you don't plan on utilizing both the PC and Mac capabilities. I've heard negative things about Seagate over the years, but this is my third Seagate drive in the last 15 years and none of them have given me any trouble. I have had a very similar model to this one for about a year now and it's still going strong with daily use. Very pleased and highly recommended.

$review_text.: I just bought the Garmin C330 for our 1-week trip to California. Before I left Iowa to fly into LAX, I entered all the addresses I planned to visit. This unit took me to all the right locations (hotels, restaurants, attractions, friends',etc) in San Diego, Orange County, San Francisco, San Jose and back to LAX. Particularly, I had to stop by a house in Newport Coast, CA unexpectedly. This house is in a gated community on a hill top overlooking the Pacific Ocean. It requires many turns to get there. I consider myself a good navigator with traditional map but I think I would have difficulty trying to get there without the GPS. People at the house were shocked that I was able to get there the first time given just the address. I was really impressed with the C330's capability. I also like the POI's features, especially the "fuel" and "restaurant" features. At anytime, it can show me the restaurants (by type such as Fast Food, Chinesee,etc) nearby. It really helped because sometimes a McDonald is only a street or two from either your left or right side and you do not know it. The unit will show all the restaurants nearby around your current position.On I-5 from LAX to San Francisco, it took us to a gas station that had been closed. Luckily, there was another gas station that was about a mile away. New businesses open and old ones close everyday, so I do not expect the POI (point of interest)to be 100% updated and accurate.Negatives: I think another reviewer has pointed out, the volumn control does not work very well. It is either max (a little loud) or you cannot hear it if you turn it down. However, I consider it a minor problem. I wish they have a listing for "pizza." My daughter loves pizza especially Pizza Hut and Papa John. I was having difficulty finding it at first under "fast food" but later on found out they were listed under "Italian." They don't seem to list pizza places that only have carry-out and delivery. Before I leave for a trip, I normally check the Pizza Hut and PPJ websites for their locations, then enter them in the unit.Mounting: The unit comes with suction cup, but I have not tried it out. Since I was going to California (it is against the law in CA to have anything attached to the windshield) I bought the dash mounting kit. The mounting kit worked very well in my rental car. It never slipped even going on the steep hills in San Francisco. I plan to use this dash mount in my own car in Iowa also.I considered a Magelan unit first but after reading user reviews I decided to buy the Garmin C330. I saved about $75 by buying from Amazon compared to same unit sold at Best Buy and Wal Mart.The C320 unit does not have the preloaded map. You would get a CD and need to connect the unit to your PC to download the map of the region to plan to travel to from the CD to the GPS unit.The C330 has preloaded map. It keeps telling you how far before your next turn (e.x "in 1.2 mile turn left, in 500 ft turn left") but does not tell you what street to turn to. All you have to do is glance at the unit. The top of the screen instructs what street to turn to.The C340 is the same as the C330 except it has 2 additional features: the voice tells you which street to turn to, and the traffic management feature (I think you have to subscribe to this service.)In conclusion, I really like this unit. I thought I would not need a GPS since I was very good at navigating using traditional maps. Now, GPS is the way to go for me. Another benefit is when it is foggy or raining and it is difficult to see the street names, you can tell what streets you are coming to next by looking at the GPS.Thank you the US Department of Defense for making the GPS available to us.

Do not underestimate the fun part of having a camera - look beyond the specifications.- Nice screen.- Auto focus is stupid fast with the kit lens in good light. Pretty fast with the panny 20mm.- Build quality seems very good to me.- Excellent IQ.  No its not full frame but if you want full frame - get full frame.- JPEGS are really good, great color and white balance.- Did I say that this was a fun camera to use?- Good lens selection. About all I could ask for now is a lightweight m43 version of Oly's 12-60mm.- The touch screen auto focus is almost instant and fun to use. Sometimes I bump it accidentally but who cares.Cons- Sensor is old news, so high ISO can't match the APS-C competition. But don't let that kill the deal, for most stuff you should be using a flash if its too dark.- A little pricey IMO.- Kit lens sharpness is not stellar (but good for a kit lens).- Low light auto focus is not what I would call stellar, but is on par for CDAF cameras.- 3 FPS continuous is kind slow for a nicer camera. This is not a sports camera.- I wish the screen was reticulated.In short it is excellent for  everyday use, particularly when you do not want to lug your DSLR around. With the Panasonic 20mm I can fit it into a coat pocket comfortably which is nice.  It will fit in large cargo short pockets  with the 20, but its a little heavy to walk around with like that.  With the kit lens it'll fit in a big jacket pocket, but that is starting to push it.  Once you figure out the menu system, you will like it, especially the super control panel, which has been an Oly feature for a long time and is great.I tried a NEX-5N, and while the high ISO was really, really good (yep, its good), I enjoyed using the E-P3 more. It just feels a lot more responsive, shot to shot times seem significantly quicker. It has a built in flash which does come in handy. You can use other flashes, the NEX is limited (although the fl-36r which I have feels big on it).  High ISO is not as good for the pixel peepers but who cares for 90% of the stuff you're going to use. The only reason I would get an NEX-5N over the E-P3 is if I was into manual focus which I am not, or need high ISO a lot.
$SUMMARY.: Very nice camera even if a little overpriced

$REVIEW.: [[UPDATE June, 2011:  We've had this thing on for five years and it still sounds sweet. My one concern is the 'analog' tuner, which collects dust in our tropical environs and creates static when you move the dial. On the other hand, we get to live by the beach in Hawaii, so too bad for us!]]I get my news from DemocracyNow.org daily and listen to all classical radio on the internet and was disgusted with the 10 foot range of the signal transmitted my Rocket FM USB powered FM transmitter (Rocket FM plugs into a computer's USB port and converts my humble iBook into a mini FM radio station so we can listen to internet audio on any FM radio). In addition, there would be signal interference when we just walked around the room. To the rescue: a Henry Kloss Model One AM/FM table radio by Tivoli Audio. It now makes my housemates' Phillips boombox sound like a cheap violin. Not only that, but I put the Model One in the bedroom a full 36+ feet (passing through three double wood-joist drywalls) and the sound is still great (no, I am no audiophile, but...). Add 18 ft. and another double wall and slight static appears. OMG, I can't wait for the [Bleeps] to move out with their [bleepin'] boombox so I can get a second Tivoli (Oh dear, which one to choose?) for the livingroom.

$REVIEW.: I needed a new TV, I did my homework for a month and purchaced the Samsung 46 inch 1080p current model, and of course it turned out excellent. If you are looking for a great 1080p TV, the Samsung fits the role perfectly.Lightweight, sturdy, excellent picture and durable the Samsung brand is one of the best names for high-def TV viewing. It does have some drawbacks, such as weak speaker quality and so-so repair support, but who really buys a 46"+ TV and uses the TV speakers. And Samsungs aren't known for their fragileness and poor worksmanship so you won't be repairing much of them.Now, a side note when ordering. I purchaced it from Amazon at a great price, well below competition prices, and had free delivery with the purchance. The problem is Amazon uses a 3rd party shipping company that isn't that great at delieveries. You can easily find many complaints against them and their procedures. I rate Amazon and Samsung as top notch with their products and service, I rate the delivery company poor. 10 days after ordering I hadn't received my TV nor heard from the delivery company so I called them. Seems they never contacted Amazon to get my delivery info, so the TV was just sitting in their warehouse. I had to CALL THEM to get the TV that I had already purchaced delivered. They also didn't set up or unpackage the TV, they sent 1 person, but the TV is very light and I could handle it easily, but a smaller person might not.Overall, a top notch TV bought from a top notch company, delievered by a not-so-good company. Still a great buy. As a last word, do your homework. Make sure to get the current year brand of the TV, and if you want to test drive it, go to your local TV store and check them out, THEN order it online and save quite a bit of money. When I bought the TV from Amazon it was the new year model and cost 1700 dollars. Best buy was selling it for 2300.
$SUMMARY.: Samsungs, great TV's very nice

The smart features aren't that great and don't work as you would want them too. Entering text is also a pain in the butt.

$REVIEW.: I have been living with a 36" crt for years, and a week ago purchased this 50" Samsung plasma screen.  A few days a year direct sunlight falls on the screen, this handles it somewhat better than the crt with adequate brightness.  Reflections are the same or SLIGHTLY worse than crt, with some reflections being annoying, but you can swivel the display on its stand and for me that gets the really bright spots (sunlit white blinds) out of the way.Resolution is immense.  HD content is great, SD looks as good as before but my expectations are raised now.  I can EASILY discern differences in lens quality used during HD broadcasts, even when all are HD and well focused.  I sit at 11 feet from the screen most of the time.Clarity color resolution... it's just incredible.  With my 36" crt, I had to turn away from the screen on many pan shots because the poor image caused my eyes to cross and hurt.  Its less with this tv, but still there, though I have not tried and blu-rays yet so perhaps its an artifact of 1080i comcast?  While most LCD's looked "sharper" in the store, and were obviously brighter, this picture looked the best.  The LCD's showed over sharpening artifacts like white halos (especially around text), at home this plasma looks very very SHARP.  I think the sharper looking LCD images would wear on me and look fake after a few days.I turned the "color" (saturation) setting down to 30 because at 55 reds were horibbly blown out and colors were cartoonish.  The picture is scarily natural now.  I had gone to the stores thinking the Panasonic Viera would be my TV, but its picture did not look anywhere near as good.  It reminded me of Kodak digital cameras, so unnatural I could wretch.The size of the screen made my eyes strain as the brightness changed rapidly, especially cuts to black.  The tv is in a corner so I placed a regular table lamp behind the screen for "bias lighting" providing a great reduction in eye strain and it looks great to boot.THE SPEAKERS ARE HORRIBLE!  I really honestly mean that, you CANNOT USE the built in speakers.  They clip sound so badly you may not even hear that background music exists, and you will miss half the sound effects.  It sounds like people are talking into coffee cans.  I had to disable the speakers and hook up my sound system permanently for ALL tv watching.  I'm ok with that now that its set up and my remote is programmed properly, but I was hoping for better, there is no excuse for being this bad.  Just miserably awful awful awful bad nasty speakers.  Very Bad speakers.So?  MY conclusion is that while its nice to have an all-in-one tv, its just not practical.  Its never been practical, it never will be practical.  You need a cable (or sat) box to decode all but the fundamental channels, a dvd/blu-ray player for recorded content, and in this case, a stero system in order to hear sound.  The TV provides a picture and nothing else, and in this case, its a great picture so all is well.  Samsung, please stop advertising SRS surround and "rich bass", nobody will ever believe that BS.
$SUMMARY.: Remarkably good picture, remarkably bad sound.

And this goes for this remote from Satechi. Don't get me wrong though. It does a great job and can be a great tool.It replaces my Apple remote easily. Having all the features that I am use to. And the it does just as you would expect when in presentation mode and running Keynote on my Mac. Where it is unique is it's ability to be used as a remote for iPad presentations. Very cool and works well. I do wish it was easier to switch between using it with my laptop vs my iPad. It has to be paired each each time you switch. Another plus for the remote is that it is pretty comfortable in the hand, actually more so than most.I have started using Apple TV in my classroom so that has allowed me to use my iPad or iPhone as a remote and that has worked very well. But for those times that I have to present outside of my room and it's Airplay abilities, this remote is a nice companion.

$review_text.: This is a really cool device.  You can set up a dual monitor on your computer without buying a new video board.  You have to have an USB port available.  On my desk top I have 7 ports, but on my ultrabook I only have two. This unit comes with the software and one 3.0 USB to 2.0 USB plug.  You'll have to supply your own cable from the adapter to the monitor.  The output port from the display adapter is a single 2.0 USB...so you may have to buy a cable or purchase an adapter.  Once you have the correct cable, its plug and chug.  Install the software, follow the prompts.  I really like this with my ultrabook.  I can't give a fair comparison on the image quality since the external monitor I used is one of the older ones and the resolution on it can't compete with the one on my ultrabook; however, the image is crisp and the colors display correctly on the external screen.  If your video board isn't set up for two displays, this is a cost conservative way to get that second monitor.  Used it on my desk top, and I love the fact that I can have two open and visible screens at the same time. Cut/copy and go the other screen to paste..no more opening and closing screens as I do my PowerPoints.. click .. drag...drop.

$review_text.: I didn't expect this flash drive to be so wonderfully compact


It has been several years since I've purchased a flash drive and was expecting a large thumb-drive-size item (and was OK with that)

What arrived is tiny and a much more welcome addition to my keychain.Regarding reviews that the device is flimsy: I have no idea what all these people are doing to their flash drives, but short of physically abusing the unit I'm unclear how you would dent the metal casing or extract the electronics mounted inside

I applied significant pressure to the casing with my fingers and there was zero deflection in the metal

I'm fairly confident I would either need to stomp it on a concrete surface or use vice grips to actually damage it.

$REVIEW.: I got this antennae to use with the echo repeater system. Works good. I actually mounted it in the attic. I realize that may or may not be an issue for me at different times a year, but I will see and let you know later. I also realize depending on many different variables this location will not work for everyone. Being in Wisconsin I am supposed to aim the antennae straight up.My only complaint would be that although they give you mounting hardware. The hardware for mounting it to a pole was too small for the pole my old satellite dish was on. (Could use more pole mounting options)and being that it was still winter out I figured for ease of installation I would try the attic. Hooked it up to the repeater system and they both work great. Only had it a few weeks, have not needed to make any adjustments since setup. If I find anything to add later I will.Just wanted to add that it's been over a year now and still never had to adjust the antennae!

$REVIEW.: I had been looking for a relatively inexpensive pair of headphones I could use while exercising especially that won't fall out while running. I had been a fan of Sony's noise isolating headphones but my biggest complaint was that of many Sony headphones was you could hear the rubbing of the cord through the headphones whenever it made contact with my body. I looked through a lot of different buds of various prices before trying the JVC. When people complain of the sound quality, I have to assume they haven't used the proper of the three included soft buds that you can interchange. I found the largest pair was best for isolation and also provided a solid amount of bass. Midrange and highs I think are very solid. It does a decent job of isolating outside noise while my iPod is on but don't confuse this with noise canceling earphones. That's not what these are. I admit it takes a try or two to get used to fitting the clips over the ear and buds properly into the ear, but once in they feel very comfortable. The hooks over the ear are lightweight and the cord doesn't result in any extra noise. I regret that I wound up getting them at Best Buy as it cost me a few extra bucks even though it still cost me under $20. I've yet to see how long they'll last but you could pay a lot more for worse headphones. So far I'm very pleased with the JVC.

$review_text.: Well,  I bought this to protect my Nikon D40.  First the complaints:CONS:  Having a D40 it's too big for the camera.  I have a the stock lens and a 55-200 DX lens.  I still have a lot of space available.  Too much space that I will have to buy additional spacers.  Right now I insert my  camera with the lens pointing up so that the camera doesn't shift too much.PROS:1.  This bag has gone through 2 tests.  We had a Kids Weekend Cabin Camp and a trip to the beach.  First, it is very comfortable.  I never experienced any fatigue or pain even though I was wearing the bag the whole weekend taking pictures and hiking through out the woods with some 70 plus kids.  I did sweat a little on my back but it quickly dried when I took a rest.2.  Having the phone and an accessory loop was very convenient.  I used it for my cell phone (Blackberry 8100 - fits perfectly) and the accessory loop for the a small walkie-talkie.  Great placement right under the shoulder.3.  Went to the beach, a strong wave went up and got to our stuff including the bag.  All contents was dry and safe.  The bag was a little wet but the camera was safe.4.  The extra space is great for all kinds of stuff.  You can fit a small camcorder.  I put my small point and shoot in the mesh pocket and old Sony DSC-W1 but it still fits.  Also I LOVE the water bottle pocket on the side.  It can accommodate all different sizes of bottles.Conclusion.  A GREAT buy.  I already had my investment back just the fact it protected my camera and was very useful.  I'm 5-6 so the bag is a bit big or looks big.  Also styling isn't too great looks like an awkward school backpack but it's a camera backpack so who cares.  I'm fully satisfied.

$REVIEW.: I am not the most technically savvy person, so I can only tell you what I see and understand about this product.  First of all, it was incredibly easy to open.  There were no fights with the plastic boxes that seem to have no openings and I was not forced to resort to arming myself with scissors or a box cutter, greatly reducing the chances of injury.  Who wants their tombstone to read "She died valiantly fighting product packaging"?  Second, the cable looks great.  It seems far sturdier than other cables I have used in the past and the bits on each end look well made.  Third, and perhaps most important, this product is backed by Amazon, meaning good customer service and support, as well as easy return (if needed).  The product has a 1-year warranty and since I have not had any problems with Amazon service in the past, I am sure that using that warranty, if necessary, would be easy.  I am glad that Amazon has started the Amazon Basics line.  It removes the need for all those little trips to the electronics store and replaced it with easy shopping and easy shipping at competitive prices.

I followed instructions online and it was very simple.The hard drive is silent. Runs a tad faster it seems. So far no complaints about it. Love the extra hard drive space.

$review_text.: I find these headphones to be very tight and I don't have an unusually large elephant head.  I know these are cheap but I expected them to be more comfortable.  They are a pain to wear for me after an hour or so.  The cushions on the earpieces are fine though so if you have a long narror face go for it.  For $20, it's plastics galore as expected but the sound is not bad at all and I primarily use it for gaming so as not to wake up the house at night.Update - I have not changed the original rating because it has nothing to do with it, my dog chewed off the wire.  After much soldering and trying to fix (which was a pain), these are in the bin, RIP.

$REVIEW.: I replaced a large wire cage antenna rigged up on my station facing window in my bedroom on the second floor. I used the same window and the same amplifier. With this new antenna I can get the two Miami, FL VHF stations (10.1 ABC and 7.1 FOX) which are difficult to get at 23 miles from any indoor antenna solution. The way I got these stations previously was a wire cage antenna on the balcony of my living room and I've been waiting for the condo association to call foul at any time. I had no problem getting ALL of the UHF stations before I even hung this antenna in the window.Highly recommended but should cost $25. I basically bought this one for aesthetic reasons so if you already have a working solution, that is what you're paying for.I posted a photo of my bedroom window (with vertical blinds) so you can see the setup that this antenna replaced.
$SUMMARY.: Expensive but worth it.

$REVIEW.: I am not really a TV lover.  I grew up literally on the "Backside of Beyond" where there was no Television reception.  However several years ago I purchased an HDTV which I connect to a computer for watching Blu-ray movies.  However I do like to watch Football.  So in the past I've tried different antennas of this type and generally not had good results.This antenna, by comparison, works wonderfully.  And since the price I paid is about half what competing products in the local stores.  I'm extremely pleased with my purchase.  So now I watch some Football without feeling frustrated because I spent too much on an Antenna that doesn't get good reception.  :D

$review_text.: Let me preface this by stating I did not pay for these.  Vine reviewers get the items for free.  I'm not sure I would drop $200 (cost at the time I am reviewing them) for a pair of headphones, regardless if they were Monster or not.  A hundred bucks, yes, but probably no more than that.  I initially got these to wear for running, but I don't know how well they would hold up to the sweat during use so I cannot comment on their water resistance.  Let me start w/ the packaging.  In a word, awesome.  The magnetic closure storage 'book' these things came in is awesome.  Also included are two different carrying pouches and about a bazillion different size/type of earbuds.  I have seen other headphone reviewers complain about the in-ear fit not working for them, but that just isn't the case with these.  There's just too many options to choose from.  I used these with an Ipod Touch and a Samsung Epic 4G phone.  Sound quality was amazing on both.  I am tempted to try them on a run anyway just because the quality was that good.  The in-line volume control worked as described w/ the Ipod. Obviously it had no effect on the phone.  The Monster brand is synonymous w/ high quality overkill and high price also and these headphones deliver both.  Well worth the kwan if you can afford it.**update**I wore these on a run and the experience was horrendous.  The buds are heavier than many 'sport' headphones and they kept falling out.  Definitely keep these for non-impact movements.

$review_text.: I purchased the R7000 and the Asus AC68 at the same time, so I had the chance to compare them side by side for five days.I assume you've read about the features these routers have, so I won't recap them.  Instead, here is my summary assessment after five days.  I pushed both of these hard to stress test them with wildly high concurrent traffic on the local and wan networks.Both the R7000 and AC68 gave me a 2X boost in local network traffic (I had no idea my old router was slow).  Both were able to achieve sustained downloads of 10-15 gig files over the internet (wired connection) at about 15-20% faster than my old router.I have between 30-40 wireless devices (iPhones, iPads, kindles, laptops, tvs, xboxes, wiis, windows, mac, linux, two wireless printers and an array of wireless enabled power switches, cameras and hue lights by philips) connecting at any one time using a mix of b, g, n and ac networks.  I use Comcast as my ISP.  I also have 8-10 wired devices.The distances some of the wireless clients use is fairly substantial - more than 200ft through walls and brick and more than 400ft through walls and glass to reach some outside devices.  I generate a decent amount of bandwidth usage - my local network traffic is near 1TB a day and my WAN traffic is no less than 8G a day but often much much higher (work).R7000 - a snap to setup, big, bulky, clunky firmware that truly is not yet able to produce some of the features they market (QoS upstream and downstream is problematic, beamforming was not turned on until the second firmware update).  No stability issues - no dropped clients (using beta 197 firmware).  Found no need to reboot.  2.4ghz band operated significantly faster than my old router.  AC network blazing fast.  Updating firmware is a MUST.  Read the forums carefully, certain firmware is more problematic than others.  I installed DD-WRT on it, confirmed it worked, then went back to Netgear firmware.  DD-WRT firmware should let you overclock this router to get enhanced performance for situations like mine with a lot of traffic.  Good range on both 2.4ghz and 5ghz.  I do have a NetGear beam forming capable adapter that I paired with the R7000 and I got excellent distance on the AC network as a result.I did not experience speed degradation or dropped clients.AC68 - easy setup, smaller, sleeker, better build than the R7000.  Firmware is much better out of the box.  Product required no firmware tinkering.  No rebooting needed under high stress.  In fact, I crashed my cable modem but not the router.  AC network blazing fast, like the R7000.  Slightly better range than the R7000, with the exception of the NetGear to NetGear beam forming network adapter (requires firmware with beamforming turned on).  DD-WRT and Tomato are both available for the AC68.If you are not afraid to get your hands dirty and you generate a lot of network traffic then the R7000 is the way to go because it has a faster processor and you can overclock it using DD-WRT.If you want to plug it in and forget it - then I would say the AC68 is a better choice.

$REVIEW.: I can't believe how powerful this laptop is proving to be.....with the i7 processor, 16GB memory, and dual video cards, there isn't a lot this thing can't do.  I've already loaded BF4, COD Ghosts, and BioShock Infinite, and the default graphic settings are maxed out, and this thing has no trouble at all with any of them.  Also, I normally game on a 30" 2560x1600 IPS monitor.....so most every other screen I see looks like crap.  Not so with this laptop, the screen looks great!Pros:  Powerful, love the feel and looks of the lighted keyboard, great looking screen, very snappy with the 8GB SSD cache, very quiet....even under full load of gaming, built in speakers sound great.Cons:  Large for a 15" laptop, power supply brick size (I guess it's needed to power this beast), and yes...the infamous horrible trackpad.  It's as bad as everyone states...it actually depresses below the case when you use the buttons....and the curser moves when you tap the buttons.  Absolutely, positively the worst trackpad in existence....good thing I rarely use one.  Also, I don't consider Windows 8 a con for this laptop.  Install the start button utility...and it's basically just like Windows 7.Even with the cons, I would highly recommend this laptop to anyone.  It's a great value, and you get much more for your money at this price point than you would with other laptops.  Thumbs up!

$review_text.: This antenna is ok but no knock-out.  I agree with one reviewer in that you get better HD reception when you lower and retract the 2 VHF antennas and then turn the UHF antenna side-ways.  On the another hand, I get NO Local channels in my town...go figure.  I do get channels between 50 to 75 miles away... I think this is so weird!Has a nice design than is obscure.  People can walk in and not notice it. But it has a short antenna cable...like real short.  You may want to purchase a longer cable too so that you can move this antennae on top of your entertainment center for better reception.  I would try it but I would  also try something that has better reception capabilities.

$REVIEW.: It's the very same bracket as the Stroboframe I have. I bought this for my second camera. I haven't had a chance to try this one out but I have used the Stroboframe for shooting weddings for a couple of years now and am generally pleased with it. It is nice to be able to switch quickly from landscape to portrait view (and vice versa) without changing the orientation of the flash. My only complaint is that the bracket tends to swivel partially by itself from the weight of the flash. You can adjust this somewhat but you are essentially just tightening a bolt and nut, and the swivel soon loosens up again.

$REVIEW.: This card is okay, but I can't imagine it being an upgrade. I started building computers in 1989 while using DOS. So while I sympathize with those who've had problems with their installation, I didn't (I pulled out my hair in the early 90's, but by 2000 it grew back fuller and more manageable).Here's the problem I have and it might apply only to those building Next Units, or maybe not.  I'm running Win 7  on the NUC and have a Asus laptop with the same using the Atheros AR9485WB card. I'm at my bench in the garage (when I benchmark it's for real) and finish the OS installation (when assembling have all drivers ready, unless you often put on your shoes and then remember socks) and start Win update and my connection is slow as a one legged centipede. So I finish everything and all is well except for speed. Well, the Nuc is getting 2 bars just like the laptop but only  the speed. I try all the settings and even spent an hour doing research because I don't know it all and still no improvement.I knew my wireless was weak and so I merrily skipped down to Office Max to buy an overpriced extender. Seeing the highly recommend D-link I proceeded to to purchase 2 hours of headache, but that's yet another review. After getting my New Age torture device (one button setup my arse) functioning at 100% my laptop gets full or nearly full speed and my Intel with Intel is 80% at best. I use a program called inSSIDer Office (there's a free trial) to sort out signals and give stats and strengths and I'm considered excellent, I love programs that say that about me, but using Comcast speed test (which I prefer) and Speedtest.net and verifying with Windows resource monitor, facts are facts. This will not provide full speed with a 93% perfect signal while my laptop will. I've worried this problem as fully as the first server I built and even rolled back drivers but I may have to enlist several tiny men in lab coats to resolve this conundrum.I see a possible reason being poor antennas in the NUC and may follow up on this by installing an external, or not. Hey, no problem with the Bluetooth! I've promised myself that I won't check the range. If I hadn't thoroughly tested this and my laptop side by side I could have made excuses and assumptions and right now I'd be blissfully ignorant, but my frustration is your gain. I wonder if others reviewing this know if they are getting good speed? Or just good signal. No offense intended to those who do know. Well as usual I write too much and you've probably already started the next review. So bringing you the longest Amazon reviews since 1887 (and without the express written consent of the National Football League) I sincerely hope this helps at least one person.Update: I have purchased a USB wireless and ran tests for 40 minutes and this is what I found. First I ran the same tests against the laptop and taking the average of ten tests on each, they now run at the same speed, up and download. Sorry Intel, but you've been bested by Atheros and now Ralink by Etekcity. But, what's really interesting...I connected to the router instead of the extender and reached identical speeds of 2 Mbps over what I'm paying for. This USB device is also picking up 19 more networks than I previously saw. This doesn't provide Bluetooth but I could have saved the cost of the extender and bought a Bluetooth dongle and had a much better wireless all for $8 more and I can use it with the laptop also.

These subs sound so much better than the polks.  It's like using a surefire flashlight after getting using a regular mag-light.  The 2 subs were too much in the ported box so I put one in a sealed box running on 1500w RMS and it sounds great.  Still louder than the 2 polks and I have had no problems pushing the high wattage to this sub.  Great driver for the money and it will handle the power it says it will.  Pioneer also makes a grill specifically for these speakers that fits nicely and protects your investment.  I would definitely buy this sub again and would recommend it for anyone who wants a good sub on a budget.

On my camera's highest settings (each image roughly 300-500k) I can shoot approximately 500-600 images.I have a Viking 128mb card as a back up if I run out of room (rarely do I need it) In Nine months I have NOT had ANY fatal errors with this card being bad
Which is amazing as I have shot approximately 9K images
and normally shoot until this card is full, or close to it.I have shot with this card in Chicago winters and Chicago summers, which, if you know Chicago, is a good testament to its durability.The Sandisk 256 is a nice roomy dependable 256 card, I highly recommend

I am very good at applying screen protectors, but this one was horrible.  My screen was dust free. I used stickers to make sure the dust was not present. (Stickers this product provides).  I applied exactly like instructions and even watch the video.The air bubbles were tremendous in number.  I could not get them all out.The texture of the screen protector is not smooth.  It seems to have a sticky layer.  Not sticky enough to actually stick a peice of paper to it, but enough to keep the screen from being smooth.When I rubbed my finger across the screen after applying the protector, My finger would grab at the screen protector.It is like a rubber substance.

$review_text.: This screen protector is great, amazing quality and a perfect fit! It comes with everything you need to apply and anyone with half a brain and a little patience can apply this film perfectly

The seller even sends an email with detailed installation instructions and even several video links for every step


If you take your time and follow the instructions you will have no problems with the installation

Takes about 5-10 minutes taking your sweet a$% time
You get a microfiber cloth to clean the screen and rigid card to push the bubbles out.

I got only 3 or 4 uses out of them before the wire came out of the left side, and I had taken the greatest care not to put any stress on any part of them. I should have asked for my money back but instead I threw them away and made a mental note to not buy anything branded with the name Altec Lansing.

$review_text.: I purchased this for an even 10 spot and it was shipped within seven days to me from the UK by Royal Mail. It came in perfect condition and I could smell the leather immediately after piercing the shipping envelope. It is extremely well made and the rounded corners are somewhat stiff. My Lenovo K-1 fits in it snugly and all of the controls are accessible. The device fits into it and a leather cover wraps around the top. This flap has two small magnets sewn into it that attach to additional magnets or metal fitted inside the leather at the bottom of the device. Basically this is from top to bottom. When you unsnap it, it exposes the touchscreen and bends around the back along creases in the leather. It then fits under a stiff leather catch that keeps it sturdy in the upright landscape position. This may not be clear but, trust me, it works very well in the landscape only position. It cannot be used as a stand in the portrait position. However, when the cover is closed you feel like if you dropped it, especially on carpet, the leather case would protect your K1 from damage. it would also most probably protect it from a drop to a wood floor, and very possibly from a hard tile floor. It would mostly depend on how it landed. Recommended if not having a portrait stand is not a dealbreaker. The most quality 10 bucks has ever bought me. Even a $25, no one is selling all genuine leather cases custom made for this device. Your choice of black or brown. In brown, someone may not even know it is a tablet, mistaking it for some kind of attach&eacute; case and might be a theft deterrent. LOL

$review_text.: I love for the purposes of being the self proclaimed PAPA-razzi!!! I could not be happier about the photos I am getting of my family and the scenery around us


 The huge focal length range was ill advised by my real paparazzi friend, who happend to own all pro stuff and told me buy the 14-24, the 24-70, and the 70-200, crazy does he think i am made of money?Anyways 18-55mm is a range that you must cover if you are to get good family shots (ie dinner table) and 55-200 is a range that is fun to have for sporting events and long distances

 Yes you can buy two lenses separately to cover that range at less than $400 but then you better be ready to switch lenses.I was convinced that one lens at a premium price and a better build was worth it

 And I feel I made the right choice no lens swapping except to use appease the side of me that listens dearly to KenRockwell and make use of that 35mm fixed lens that he says is all you need (sorry ken but 18-200 is all I need, the 35 seems like it is a horrible choice for some of the more family oriented situations and being filipino, family means more than 4 people, which is all you can fit in a close shot with the 35mm)

 Plus I am all about looks and this baby is big, it is real pro looking 72 mm is no joke
I get comments on how big my lens is all the time and I must say it feels damn good.

$review_text.: I own the DT880 (which are hard to drive) and wanted something a little more portable and pc friendly.  The tonal balance of the DT 235 is very similar to the DT880.  The bass of the DT 235 is closer to that of the more bass heavy DT990 and the DT 235 doesn't go as deep as either the 880 or the 990.  Overall, they are a bit less smooth and extended and not quite as detailed - but very close.  Now remember these are about 1/6 the price of the DT880 which are considered one of the best headphones around.  If you want something under $100 I doubt you'll find anything better. For classical using a good headphone amp I love the DT880.  But the little DT 235 acquits itself well with everything that I've thrown at it, and frankly I like the bump of the DT235 better for rock music. So overall I am very pleased with the sound and comfort of these guys at a truly amazing price.

$REVIEW.: Recently, I realized that the cloth drawstring bag that came with my Flip camera was staining its plastic white cover, so I was happy to see this product offered on Amazon Vine.My Flip camera fits well inside the middle of the three generously-sized well-padded pockets. There's room to spare in that compartment, so an even larger camera would fit, too. The other pockets afford room for additional accessories. It would even hold a few credit cards and some cash if you didn't want to carry a wallet or small purse.The Velcro closure is snug and there is an option to attach the case to your belt or use the included the wrist strap. If wanted, a neck strap (not included) could be added.The Amazon Basics tag is very low-key which gives this a higher quality look.

$review_text.: From my experience NetGear products are superb. Our home network works off of a Netgear 3400 router which runs a lap top, tower, and Roku. In addition the range extenders work wonderfully as well and have eliminated dead spots throughout the house.Recently I inherited another Desk top but getting it to connect to our network our ISP was a major headache, time consuming and in the end an exercise in futility. I thought an external wireless adapter might do the trick so I ordered the NetGear N300 USB adapter - and Viola! The computer was connected and online in minutes. Remember not to install the adapter until prompted.Installation gives you two choices - the plug N' Go which requires you to press the reset button on the adapter and within two minutes press the reset button on the router I did this a few times but never got a connection. The other way which I found easier is to choose manual - all you do is enter your pass phrase  for your network and or router and that's that - instant connection!Included in the box is the N300 adapter,The USB cable and cradle and cable, the resource CD and related paper work i.e.: easy start instructions, warrantee (one year) and so on. If you're looking for an effortless way to connect a computer to your home or office network and want to avoid the headaches often associated with doing so this little gizmo is brilliant.The price on Amazon can't be beat - roughly a 40% discount and if you have a Prime membership you get two day shipping for free - making the deal on this excellent adapter just that much sweeter.

$REVIEW.: I hadnt heard of Altego before receiving this backpack; so i wasnt sure what quality of product to expect. But i have had this product for about a month now and i am very pleased. The quality is very good, the zippers close/open easily, and the magnetic buckles are great. I love the padded back; which is where you put your laptop. I easily fit in my Dell 17inch laptop inside here; and it doesnt bother my back at all.Inside the main compartment there is another zippered slot (for smaller laptops or important folders i suppose), another slightly smaller unzippered slot (for tablets), and 4 small pencil holders. Theres also 2 thin but long slots; which i find useful for putting in ac adapters and other wires. Its not an overwhelming amount; i think the number of compartments are just right.The outside of the bag has 2 slots on the edges for other stuff. I havent found much use for them personally. There is the zippered slot right in front which is meant for small things (pencils, erasers, hand sanitizers, etc...) and another small one on the at the top.Overall i dont think you will be left disappointed if you purchase this bag. It will hold alot of things , has a desirable amount of compartments, and most importantly feels comfortably and high quality.

$review_text.: I totally agree that there are times our phones and other electronics should be turned off so that rather than posting what a great time we're having, or taking a picture of all the fun, we can actually enjoy the moment!  But often my dilemma is more along the line of needing to be in two places at one time!  If I can have my phone with me, I can engage in another event (kids's baseball game, or shopping with a friend over the lunch hour.  Too often these opportunities are tainted when I end up stressing out over a low or dead phone battery.  I pick my smart phones looking for battery life as a key factor, I also use battery saving tricks etc... but still there are times when I'm just out of battery and luck.This little charger has paid for it's self several times over just by providing a sense of security!  It seems to hold a charge forever when you're not using it, and while I haven't seen my phone go to 100% when charging off of it - it consistently gets me up in the 3/4 range!  I've never just left it charging off of this for hours so it's quite probable it would go to 100% in time. I've used it several times in a row without recharging it, never not seeing a significant bump in power - and always having plenty of power to make or receive a call.I've made friends too!  It's nice to have the ability to share a little power :)

I was recommended these because they have a good sound (which they do; a good amount of bass), but have ear clips that keep them on your ear. While that is what I was told, it turned out not to be accurate. If you have trouble with ear buds, you will have trouble with these. The clips to keep them on your ear loop around the back of your ear, but do little more than keep the chord behind your ear. Meanwhile, the headphones still slip out of my ear (and I am left with a headphone dangling NEAR my ear, but not in my ear.So, I warn those who have trouble wearing ear buds: you will have the same trouble with these. While the sound is good, they will slip out of your ear every bit as much as any ear buds.

 I chose to use the optional AC Power adapter, because I was hooking up the &quot;Viking - Intelliflash smart card reader&quot; and wanted to ensure enough power.Upon rebooting Windows ME automatically recognized the product and installed the required driver
 I verified the installation under &quot;control panel/system/universal serial bus controllers.&quot;  It was newly listed as a &quot;general purpose USB hub.&quot;  I can't imagine anyone having problem adding this hub to his or her existing system.I give it a perfect 5 for ease of installation and excellent value.

Had it not been so portable, I would not have taken nearly as many photos during my vacations. Overall photo quality was good, and the night option in scenic mode captures dark images very well. Daytime shots seem a bit darker than my old Oly C4000, but sharper nonetheless. Great camera, and the price coudn't be better for something of such high quality and convenience.

$REVIEW.: Reviews for amplified splitters and preamps are all over the map

What one person found "a great help" causes "big signal loss" for another person, so it's hard to gauge what will happen with such a purchase

The truth is that these products amplify both signal and noise, so their benefit must be considered with this in mind
Also the sensitivity and noise characteristics of the tuner(s) in the circuit play a big role


This product will help you if your signal situation is just under threshold, meaning that most signals are ok and there are perhaps a few stations which are weaker and have dropouts
If that is the case, the 11 dB of gain from this box should put you "over the top" for the weaker stations
If your reception is mostly marginal, then you will get better improvement from a bigger or higher directional antenna, coupled with the shortest run of low-loss coax


High-gain preamps (30 dB) may have poor noise figures which could swamp the signal; the antenna route is safer but may not be physically possible for everyone


This unit is solid, well-made, and stable, and I am happy with it

I am using it indoors as an amplified splitter feeding a two-input HDHomeRun tuner

Note that the power connection is via the same sort of coax used for signal, with two F-connectors

It is not included.

$REVIEW.: I decided upon this laptop after several hours of poring through reviews (thank you, amazon.com) and from other sites. In the end, the Core 2 Duo, 2GB RAM, being able to get this machine w/XP Pro, were key factors for me, along w/the rest of the specs. I am getting about 3.5hrs w/the standard battery. I prefer to keep the screen on low light, which explains the longer battery life.

I originally bought this right when it came out, but haven't written a review because I hadn't owned it long enough to decide if I made the right purchase or not.To start things off, I really like the touch screen, easy to operate and hold with one hand, but this iPod being my first touch anything, it came to no surprise. I have previously owned a 4th and 5th gen iPod, and realized that I actually prefer them more than I did with the 7th gen. I don't like what was taken away mainly, the games, video camera, speaker, notes, calendars, etc. I do like that it still has radio...but I rarely ever listen to the radio, so I don't really care that much about it. Audio books..never use them. I haven't tried out the blue tooth on this iPod yet, but I'm sure it will be nice to use when I get the right equipment. Overall, I really just like the space, the touch screen, and the it's compact size, but that's pretty much it.

$REVIEW.: The Nikon d7000 shoots pretty good video but extending one's arms to use the screen viewer is very difficult and tiring especially with heavy glass. The Adorama shoulder support solved the problem. I shot hours of still shots and video on a recent cruise and could not have accomplished what I did without it. One caveat however, well endowed members of the opposite sex will not be able to get the camera to shoot horizontally as the camera's front support fits exactly over the bust and causes the camera to point skyward. This not a joke believe me. I also used a Benro tilting head (also from Amazon) to give me more adjudtment. Well worth the money . Some people have questioned its sturdiness, I personally had absolutely no problems with it. Be sensible it is made of a reasonably tough plastic but when tightening any connection don't get too ham fisted. I am sure it will last me a long time if I treat it well.Fpor the price you just cannot be without this device on an extended shoot. I love it.

After a reboot, sometimes you need to go through Setup to reconnect to a network share. Very sensitive to bandwidth. No keyboard to enter login information for network shares or Internet services.

I was willing to spend a bit extra for a product that so many swear by from a company known for upstanding quality.I got exactly what I expected. Though I could have easily gone with 16 gauge wire, I decided to go a step up. The wire's jacket is immensely strong. My wire cutters were having a tough time getting through the clear jacket, so I switched to a simple box cutter and made small, quick, precision cuts. This sped up the process and worked flawlessly. The blue wire makes identification simple. The copper strands are sufficiently strong and effective. My speakers sound excellent and I'm entirely satisfied with my purchase.

I think I lost my cat inside here
It definitely has great airflow
If I hold my hand over the top fan, I feel cool air blowing out


I was a little concerned that it would be noisy because of all the openings, but it's actually very quiet
Just hear the fans a bit, but it's very soft


Red LED light is cool

Red LED light can be turned off which is also cool


Two USB ports in the front are very handy


I like the small tray right on top that I can put my phone or mp3 player on when I'm syncing or charging.- It's very heavy
Back panel popup (to allow stashing of cables) doesn't pop out enough

The ATX power cable is very thick and I tried to route behind the motherboard tray and up the little hold at the bottom, but the cable is so thick that it won't like the back panel slide on securely


So I had to leave that huge cable in the front, which is kind of ugly


Also, the inside is not painted, which is a bummer.o I couldn't figure out how to use the 2.5" adapter brackets to mount an SSD in the hard drive bay

There were no instructions

So I ordered a simpler adapter from Rosewill to plug in there

This was my first build

$REVIEW.: Wireless mouses are quite convenient for use with laptops since you can just set up your laptop, plunk the mouse down, and be productive right away; you don't need to mess with a cord and you don't have to plug anything in. In exchange for that convenience, you need to keep extra batteries on hand so that when the batteries in the mouse die, you can keep mousing away.This is the first Bluetooth mouse I try, and I must say I'm quite impressed. I've tried a few USB wireless mice and the older ones used to need to be re-synced every now and then, usually after changing out batteries. That process involved pressing buttons on the mouse and the receiver in the right order, I always had to do it more than once because I could never remember what order was the right one. They've gotten better since then, and my current USB wireless mouse never needs syncing at all, not even on first use. This one is not quite that convenient; you need to "pair" it before your computer will recognize it. But after that it was recognized every time without fail. I've tried it on both Windows XP and Ubuntu Linux, and it's been working perfectly every time. The computer off and on, turn the mouse off and on, no problem, it starts working again right away. And although laptops come with lots of USB ports these days, it's nice to not have one tied up all the time for use with your mouse.There is just the slightest delay, not problematic, when you move the mouse after it falls asleep. This is the trade-off for long battery life. Speaking of which, the battery's lasted a couple weeks so far. If it can last a couple months that would be really good.The feel of the mouse in my hand is nice too; the buttons are well-placed and easy to press. I personally wouldn't use the forward and back browser buttons since I prefer tabbed browsing, but there are undoubtedly people who would appreciate their presence; plus, they should be able to be re-mapped to provide other functionality.This is a well-made product, which is not the case for some other iHome products I've reviewed. My only quibble is that the batteries are hard to install because the bottom one has to be placed well inside the unit. And be careful not to remove the flexible plastic piece you find inside the battery door because if you don't put that under both batteries to use when you remove the batteries, you're going to need a screwdriver to pry out the bottom battery.

Really, I wasn't expecting much, since they are after all external speakers, but I was pleasantly surprised...  This is a great little unit...  Certainly the best I've ever owned in the "external speaker" market.  :)It's really plug-and-play...  Add the batteries, connect your MP3 player, and you're done.  I've gotten about 20 hours out of the batteries that were included with the unit, which isn't to shabby.  No, there's no AC adapter which would have been nice, but I don't miss having it, since I'd usually be running it off the battery anyway.  It's great to just pick it up and move it without having to disconnect anything when I want to move to another part of the house.  And having it run off the batteries is WAAAAAY better than having it run off of the MP3 player's juice.The sound quality is fantastic, in my opinion.  Definitely impressive considering the size of the speakers.  Sure, it distorts when you turn it up too loud, no, it doesn't sound as great as a stereo, but this isn't a stereo and some distortion isn't uncommon for external speakers such as this.  The fact that there's no distortion when it's played quietly, or even at a moderately loud level, is a miracle in and of itself when it comes to speakers like this, a lot of which sound like distorted garbage at any level, much less a loud one.  The sound quality is fantastic, not flat or echoed, and really quite impressive.On my player, playing a song heavy in bass, I had the speakers turned all the way up (they have a volume control independent of your player, which is helpful for fine-tuning the quality of the sound being put out) and my volume control set to 13 (out of 20) with no distortion, some distortion at 14, and moderate distortion at 16-17.  When I turned my player's volume to 20 (very distorted), but turned down the speakers to a point where I could hear no distortion, it was still louder than when I had the speakers turned all the way up with my player's volume at 13.  When I played acoustic music, I could have both the speakers and my player as loud as they could handle with almost no distortion.The volume on that is quite loud, loud enough to need to speak louder than normal voice to get heard in a room where it's playing.  If you need to go louder than that, well, that's not what these are made for, and you're better off buying a cable to connect your MP3 player to your stereo.Overall, this is a great unit and a great value, and I highly recommend them.  I wouldn't pay $90 for it (since that's apparently the list price), but since you can find it everywhere from here to Wal*Mart to Best Buy for $29-$40, you shouldn't have to.
$review_summary.: Great Deal for $40!!  Great Set of External Speakers!

$review_text.: If you have the PSP and a little extra cash, it's pretty much mandatory that you get a Memory Stick Duo card.  The 32MB that comes in the PSP Value Pack is just a joke -- unless you plan to use the PSP strictly for gaming only, in which case you don't need to buy a larger-capacity memory card.(I suspect Sony includes a small Memory Stick Duo card in the Value Pack to discourage people from copying movies to the PSP.  Just my wild guess.)If, however, you want to take full advantage of the PSP multimedia experience, a larger-capacity Memory Stick Duo is just a must.  Consider yourself lucky, for just six months ago a 1GB Memory Stick Duo (MSD for short) would have made you $300-$400 poorer.  Kudos to Sony for bringing the price down to something we mere mortals can afford.  But curses to Sony for not using an industry standard format like Secure Digital.Anyway, you have pretty much two choices when it comes to 1GB MSD cards.  Either a Sony, or a Sandisk.  Lexar (another company) is supposed to be selling it, too, but I haven't seen theirs in the retail channel, so the choice comes down to either Sony or Sandisk.As I mentioned many times in my previous reviews, I still have lingering doubts about Sandisk's quality control, as in the past I had no less than two Sandisk flash memory cards fail on me when I needed reliability the most (i.e., a "Kodak moment" for my digital camera).  The price difference between a Sony 1GB MSD adn a Sandisk seems pretty small.  BTW, if you see a 1GB MSD for over $150 in a store, you'd be overpaying, so come back to Amazon and get it here.The popularity of the PSP does make both the Sony and the Sandisk 1GB MSD cards hard to find, so maybe you just want to grab whichever one that's in stock.  I myself am willing to pay a bit extra for Sony's reliability, but other people have had luck with Sandisk MSD's, so don't let my experience discourage you from getting a Sandisk.  It's just that with the Sony memory card, you're unlikely to have any problems, assuming you don't bite or let your dog nibble on the card.1GB is a lot of memory.  Most PSP games use 600KB-800KB for game save data.  MP3 tunes encoded at the most common 128kbps bit rate runs about 1MB/minute, so a 4-minute song will occupy 4MB.  Video files are harder to summarize since there are so many different encoding bitrates and options (e.g., 15fps or 30fps, mono or stereo or surround sound).  I encode at 384kbps/15fps/mono, and one hour of video takes about 150MB.  If you want to encode at the more fluid 512kbps/30fps/stereo, expect about 300MB per hour.  In short, you should have no trouble fitting more than one full-length movies on this.  Feel free to e-mail me at gadgester @t hotmail if you have any questions.Because this MSD card is also "MagicGate-compatible", meaning it supports Sony's digital rights management technology, you can use it in Sony's digital audio players that take Memory Stick Duo or the full-sized Memory Stick.  An adapter is included in the package so if you have Sony gear that only takes the original, full-sized Memory Stick (e.g., most Sony miniDV camcorders and digital cameras), you can stick the smaller Memory Stick Duo into the adapter and then insert the adapter into the gizmo.
$SUMMARY.: Perfect for the PSP

$review_text.: I'm using this with my HTPC and couldn't be happier
 No driver needed with XP, and the battery life is good
 I've seen similar that have touch pads built in instead of the trackball, but I feel ergonomically this design is superior, not to mention cheaper in most cases


 I probably wouldn't recommend it if you do a lot of typing because of it's size, but w/HTPC's that is usually not an issue.Only thing I would prefer is Bluetooth instead of RF but that would obviously drive the price up.It does time out rather quickly but that's what makes the battery life so good


 I guess an option to adjust that would be nice, but then a driver would be needed.Other than the quick timeout(which doesn't bother me), this keyboard has been flawless.

$review_text.: This is my first plasma TV.  My prior TV was a 1080i rear-projection TV that has served me well over the past 4 years, but with the new 1080P technology, I decided it was time to upgrade.  I did plenty of research, including the reviews by Consumer Reports, and CNET, and read lots of user feedback from [...].  I decided to go with the Panasonic because of the rave reviews.  I was not disappointed.I did not purchase this item through Amazon, because I just can't make a purchase like this without seeing it with my own eyes.  I went to a local video store and compared it with many other sets, including Hitachi, Samsung, Pioneer, and LG.  I had them show me their demo broadcast, a cable HD channel broadcast (the Army/Navy football game was on that day), and then a Blu-Ray DVD.  To be honest, in the video store, I was a bit concerned with the quality of the HD cable broadcast.  The picture actually looked too sharp in my option, which hurt the quality.  There was a Hitachi next to it that had a softer image that looked very nice.  However, when it came to the Blu-Ray demo, there was no comparison.  I was blow away by the clarity, deep blacks, and vivid color of the Panasonic.  I watch about 50/50 HD television and DVD movies at home, so it was a tough choice between the two, but my gut told me to go with the Panasonic, so I did.I couldn't wait to get it home to see how it looked on my cable at home.  It was so much better than what I saw in the store.  I honestly don't know why it looked so bad at the video store, but I watched NFL football all day today and just couldn't believe how good it looked.  Motion blur...none at all.  And no pixelation on fast motion sports action (which was a problem on my old HDTV).  I also purchased a Playstation 3 as my Blu-Ray player.  It came bundled with Spiderman 3, and all I can say is WOW!  I don't know if I'll ever go to the movies again!  Why bother with this TV at home.My only drawback is that I wish it had 1 more HDMI connection, but I can live with 2.  Plus, the built in speakers really don't impress me. They're pretty tinny, and just sound like low quality speakers.  But since I run everything through my home theater system, that's not a problem for me at all.If you're looking for a 50" plasma, I can easily say you can't go wrong with this TV.

Sleek, smooth, delicate, crisp and most of all, navigation without the need for an internet connection (In your face, Nexus!) :-)I live in Nairobi, Kenya. So the first thing I wanted to do was to load Pan African maps from Garmin. There came a myriad of requirements that I need to have connected my device to PC, so that it is identified, then connect using Garmin Express (which totally refused to install on three borrowed PCs. Borrowed because I use Linux and Garmin got no express.rpm file)So I had to search for alternative maps. OpenStreetMaps came to the rescue and I can safely report that yes, OSM works perfectly with the device.So with all this positivity, why not 5 stars then? Well, I didn't like it that I had to install third party software to either register or download an extra map.Time for Insect and I to go Geocaching....

Went to watch it and within a half hour, it started doing things on its own - it would mute itself, it would change its input... I checked the remote and no one was touching it. I even took out the batteries, but the tv still did things on its own. The most annoying was that it would show the pop up screen for input and just cycle through the input types. cycling... cycling.... finally it would choose one and switch all by itself. I would have to pause the dvr until I could get it to stop cycling and change back to the tv signal. It did that three times in a 20 minute period. very strange.

The only other recommendation I would make would be DO NOT USE CHEAP AZZ Batteries!!!Use the Lithium type AAA's or even Good 1000mA re-chargeable AAA's for their extra power/capacity and regardless of which battery you use to ALWAYS bring an extra battery with you just in case, cuz' if you're battery dies, you WILL MISS not using this amp when listening to your tunes!!!! One person's review said that this amp shuts off his Ipod volume control???? Maybe the volume control on his earbuds bud lines, but it DOESN&#34;T on the Ipod Itself...It adjusts on the Ipod same as always!!!A GREAT BIG-- FYI for anyone considering getting this amp.....this PYLE MODEL IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE FIIO E3 model, I own both models and both are in EVERY SINGLE WAY the EXACT same thing...just different names on it is all... so grab whichever &#34;NAME BRANDING&#34; happens to be cheaper that day!!!!
$SUMMARY.: I LOVE THIS LITTLE BUGGER!!!!

$REVIEW.: At a glance, Corel 12 is an intimidating program to start painting with. Its many tools and features come with limited explanations and one needs to play around with the program a lot in order to become accustomed to it. However, compared to other programs, Corel is one of the best.To someone who's used to trying to come up with great drawings on free programs like GIMP, having all of Corel's advanced tools is truly a new experience. It's got great navigation, wonderful brush sensitivity, and enough windows and docks to sink the Titanic. It's a lot to take in at once, and I'd say it was nearly a month into using the program that I could say I even had the slightest clue what I was doing. It was well worth the wait, though: my art quality has increased about tenfold since I started using the program.Is it worth the dollar price tag, though? This is a case where you get what you pay for. I'd definitely recommend the program to any aspiring artist who has a serious interest. For a hobby artist such as myself, it is possible to get similar results with programs not so capable, but more time consuming. Tough call, but a great product.
$SUMMARY.: Great Product, Very Capable

$review_text.: There is a hand full of Internet apps available on this HDTV but I bought this primarily for the quality of the picture and to support my current Netflix subscription.  Coupled with my purchse of the 4 yr warranty, I am extremely satisfied.  I highly recommend this TV to those who will take advantage of the Internet apps.The only snag I encountered was coordinating the delivery of the TV.  The contracted delivery company gave me a 3 hour window but they weren't able to deliver as promised asking that I wait another 3 hours.  After a reschedule, they delivered as promised.

$REVIEW.: I love the less expensiveSony MDRNC33 Noise Canceling Earbudsso I thought I would try the upgrade. Big mistake. The sound isn't THAT much better when considered against the drawbacks:1) Seems to go through a AA battery about every 8 hours of listening (2 or 3 plane rides). The MDRNC33 uses an AAA battery and goes forever.2) Sends no sound through when off, whereas the MDRNC33 sends unmodified sound through and the tight-fitting ear-canal pad provides substantial noise blocking.3) The User Interface (the buttons) are complex for a new user.4) The physical size and extra weight associated with an AA battery make it less attractive than the MDRNC33 for room in your pocket. When you have it on the extra weight makes it harder to keep on and the bigger box is easier to catch on stuff and pull out.Save your money and buy the little brother. He's a much more sympatico traveling companion.

The only thing I don't like about it is the tablet pen holder on the front of it. I don't use one, don't need it, don't really like looking at it. However, not really that big of a deal.

$review_text.: We were on a rush, because we had a s-video cable and the computer we bought (HP PROBOOK 4530s, with Windows 7), and as you know, today's computers only have VGA and HDMI. So we needed a converter from VGA to S-Video. After some research, we decided that this was our best option. So we ordered it. I was a little afraid that this was not going to work. It came a day before the estimation, and I tested it and it works!! There is no loose of resolution, the size is perfect.So, if you need a converter from VGA to s-video, this is your best option.

$REVIEW.: These have been an unexpected gem in a field of mediocre product.These earphonesa.) seal out external noiseb.) are powerful enough to be heardc.) stay in place in the ears, even with violent head shakingd.) trap sweat in such a way that it does not immediately destroy the earphoneI have three noisy environments where I want to be able to hear: driving in a convertible and listening to audio books, riding a motorcycle and wanting to listen to audio books, and watching movies while walking on the treadmill at the gym

 All of these are surprisingly loud, and so far, I have tried all of the inexpensive would-be noise reducing/noise-cancelling/noise-isolating earphones to very little avail
 I also tried a product called Acoustibuds ([...]), which were too short to actually reach down into the ear canal.These earphones work well, however, providing adequate quality sound in these high-noise environments, and good to very good sound quality in quiet environments
 Driving in a convertible on the freeway (between 96 and 102 dBA), they reduce the ambient noise down to a level (82-85 dBA, is my guess) where the signal seem only slightly amplified when listening to audio books and spoken word (probably about 87-90 dBA).I took them on a trip and found that their simple noise-blocking worked better on an airplane than a pair of noise-cancelling earphones I had been using.The ear pieces which extend down into the ear canals have three sealing cups, each slightly smaller than the last

 These work well to seal the ear canal, as well as catching sweat before it can pool in the bottom of the ear canal and damage the speaker


(Note that you will still have to remove the earphone and drain it as soon as you feel sweat in it - the capacity is not large, but at least it does give you a warning).******* Update ******************I bought these on April 21st, 2011, and they lasted until October 20th, 2011
 They probably had a lot more life in them, but the left ear piece cord became a little loose, and I tried to fix it with a drop of super glue

 Afterwards, the left channel no longer was audible :(
 This was not the fault of the product


 What I wanted to write about was that they lasted through at least 500 hours of wear, most of which involved sweating, and they always worked well and sounded good

 I had already ordered a backup pair, which I am using now, and am about to order a new backup pair!

$REVIEW.: I have owned this bag for roughly five months, and I can say that it has seen it's fair share of use.  I purchased it  as an alternative to myLowepro 35091 Primus AW Premium Backpack (Black).  While the Primus has also been good when I have had a need to lug all my gear around, sometimes that much equipment isn't needed, especially for leisurely shooting.  Because of that, I'd often find myself not taking my camera with me at all.The SLRC-205 helps by providing just enough space for the essentials.  The large camera pocket can fit a decent zoom lens on a smaller body, with a prime or smaller zoom sitting under the hammock. One other large piece of gear in the second largest pocket above (another lens, an external flash, battery grip, tabletop tripod, etc.).  Depending on the size of the the last piece of gear, a few other pieces can be crammed into that space, such as a battery charger.  I have been able to fit a flash and a battery grip in there, but there isn't room for much else.  There are three other pockets, two which sit fairly flush and are pretty much good for only flat items like release cords, cables, cards, and microfiber cloths. The last pocket along the base of the strap can fit random parts (hot shoe cover, flat lens cap, compact USB card reader).The SLRC-205 is also convenient because it doesn't need to be taken off like a backpack. Although I can access my camera from the side access zipper, I need to take it off to grab a lens or get a new filter.  With the SLRC-205, it can be swung up front, and all the pockets can be accessed.  It's great for sitting down without needing to take anything off.My only qualms with this case are as follows:1. One of the corners of the camera pocket doesn't (un)zip very easily.  It could be because I'm placing a lens under the hammock, and the camera doesn't sag down into it completely.2. The hammock itself is a nice idea, but I find it a bit troublesome.  While a lens with a reversed hood can fit through the hammock quite easily, the petal-type hoods frequently get caught when trying to pull the camera out.  It's not a major snag, but it's enough to cause worry, especially if the camera is placed in and pulled out of the hammock often.3. A camera with a battery grip may not fit in the camera pocket and lens through the hammock, at the very least mine will not (Nikon D7000 with MB-D11).  Perhaps by not using the hammock and removing the lens could the camera fit, but then it may be more of a hassle than just not using the battery grip.4. While extremely comfortable in normal clothing, I find that the strap presses against my neck quite a bit while wearing a motorcycle jacket.  Although, I've never had a problem with the bag shifting around, even when I don't use the second strap to secure it.  Plus it's easier to get a sling on with motorcycle gear on than a backpack.5. Maybe it's just the way I'm wearing it, but it's harder to move with a decently sized tripod on the back.  The tripod hangs at maybe a 45 angle; I find my tripod banging up against doors, cabinets, and anything else on my way out.  While my tripod is fairly sturdy, I can't say the same about the things I'm running into.  My Lowepro backpack does a better job of holding a tripod, as it does it vertically.  I'm less worried about hitting things above my head than my side.6. I can't comment on how well the padding in the camera pocket is, but there is none whatsoever in any of the other pockets.  The larger pocket can hold another lens, but protection is nil.Rather than taking off the battery grip and putting into the large pocket (thereby losing space), I've opted to use a sling style camera strap as well.  The loops on the SLRC-205 are rather nice for looping the sling through; I really only have to worry about one strap.  Since the camera is no longer in the bag, I can put more equipment in the hammock area.  The downside to this is that I can't hop onto my motorcycle and ride around town (not that I couldn't but I'd much prefer it if my camera didn't smack against the side of my bike every second). Also, with the sling strap, I can't keep my tripod on my bag, or it'll hit that as well.Overall, the SLRC-205 is a fine bag, and while it's not as useful for larger cameras and equipment-intensive setups, it's great for those who only need a few items (most people). I'd say it's suited to be a vacationing bag, since it can fit under your seat on an airplane, it's good for hopping on and off buses, and you really only need a few basic things to take photos your family and friends will enjoy.

$review_text.: I have this sub in my Eclipse Spider. It is set up with the kappa Five amp and Infinity kappa perfect components and perfect six by nines. This is a phenomenal package that delivers such a great amount of detail and power. The sub itself is very good. It also has a built in 2 ohm switch for a large db rating boost. I am running the five's 300watts at this sub and with the switch turned on its way more than what I need. The sub is very balanced and detailed. It does not drop out in any sweep and has equal volume throughout...rare for big volume subs that just prefer to beat your brains out at certain frequencies.Another reviewer has a similar set up as me and I can echo his sentiments and say that if you are going infinity this is the way to go....along with the Kappa Five amp and Kappa perfect 6 1/2 components...which are totally a beast and the kappa perfect 6by9's. My entire system was bought from amazon and it cost me 1/3 what it would have cost me retail. I also purchased the Pioneer AVH3200BT which was also a great addition to my setup. This is a sub is like a fine vintage Infinity product, and the two ohm/ four ohm switch is one of the coolest things I have seen on a car sub, no bridging involved. I personally think it looks great as well. I don't want to say buy it....because I would like one more in the future for myself, but since honesty is a factor...sigh... buy it.

That part appears very sturdy and durable.Con: The ability for this thing to hold a very light 7 inch tablet is ridiculously horrible.  There are small, square pieces of felt like material that are glued onto the four corners and these are the main component to provide traction to hold the tablet.  Unfortunately, the glue that is used to hold those pieces of felt on is not secure enough and the felt ended up coming off at least two of the corners on both of the headrest mounts that I purchased. The normal movement of your vehicle will cause the tablet to jar loose and slide out of the bottom.

$REVIEW.: When I do astrology readings I have a lot of gifs, text documents, videos, and pdf files to share with the client. I burn them on to DVD but needed storage cases to put the discs into. These are just what I needed. I have a software program what I use to create insert labels and these storage cases have little "lips" to slip the inside label under to keep them in place.

$REVIEW.: I am using this computer to complete this review. Overall I like the computer. I travel a lot in rough country and it is small and light. The battery life is realistically the expected one half of the advertised number of hours or about 7 hours for this one. Also it does not have an adjustment for keystroke pressure so if you hit the keys too hard the cursor will jump to another location which is very time consuming. I recommend this computer with these limitations.

$REVIEW.: I bought this after experience with the larger DSLR pouch and reading reviews on this one. It does fit my new Olympus OM-D EM-5, but it is quite snug. With the kit 12-50 mm lens, there is some space at the end of the lens pocket, with the Oly M.Zuiko 40-150, the lens is pretty much up against the end of the pocket. Fastening the top flap is a bit tight, but you can do up both snaps if you stretch it a little. Again, the pouch gives some weather and impact protection to your camera, and is very compact, so the camera fits nicely in your backpack or bag. I always carry my camera with a cover on, just in case I bump into something or get a little mist. With a little practice, one can get the pouch off and on fairly quickly.However, I think I'll get an accessory grip for the OM-D and this pouch won't fit over the camera + grip. Probably get the D-midsize pouch in that case.The only reason it gets four stars instead of five is because although Op/Tech recommended this for the OM-D, it really isn't ideally fitted for it. If the top of the case had a little bit of a bulge to give the viewfinder a little more space, it'd be nearly perfect.Highly recommended, and made in the USA!
$SUMMARY.: Snug, but secure fit for Olympus OM-D

$REVIEW.: I've had my S500 for about six months, and have used it extensively indoors, outdoors, and underwater.PROSSize.  With any number of slim cases available, the S500 can be worn on your belt very comfortably.  It's not too heavy, and it's small enough that it doesn't get in the way much more than a cell phone, doesn't look like a fanny pack, etc.  If you're considering this camera, size is probably your number one concern, making this a great choice.CONSPictures sometimes come out bright when using the flash.  The brightness isn't bad enough that your pictures won't turn out good, but it is slightly brighter than you might expect (I.e., if you're using another Canon or other digital brand already).  It also looks brighter on the LCD than it does when you view the pictures on a PC.MISC.- At max size and resolution, pictures may be over 3MB in size.  I use a (few) SanDisk 512MB CompactFlash cards (SDCFB-512-A10), which hold around 200 pictures a piece.- Battery life is decent, but you'll probably want a spare if you're going to be on the move all day.  The Canon Digital Elph Camera Accessory Kit includes a battery, mid-size carrying case (great for travel) and a slim belt case.  At ~$60, you can't beat it.- For underwater photography (also good for rain, skiing, etc.), the underwater housing (WP-DC800) works great.  I've taken several hundred underwater shots at a variety of depths (snorkeling and diving), and they come out very clear, with good light levels.Overall, if you want a high-quality, compact digital, I don't know that you can do much better.
$SUMMARY.: Terrific, compact camera...

This board did not disappoint me one bit, it instantly knew what the processor was, and I didn't have to set up the RAM type, but I made sure the timings were correct.for a small board it has plenty of functionality, added a 460 GTX to give the graphics more power, and that card was short enough that the SATA ports are still fully accessible, your going to run into problems with the bigger cards anything over nine inches (460 measured in at 8.9), saved money by using the existing IDE drives, it's great.My nephew now has a decent gaming system, and very powerful workstation in one now, only drawback I can see is the standard heatsink can whine up a bit, but that's nothing major, since you would have to be putting the CPU under a heavy load like a CPU benchmark, Prime95, Video/audio encoding, as the rest of the system is whisper quiet, and the old case is still going strong, case fans still move a ton of air, and you wouldn't know it was on if it wasn't for the power light and front panel.system spec:AMD Phenom II 955 Black EditionGigabyte GA-880-UD2HG.Skill Ripjaw 2x2GB 10666 (1333MHz)EVGA GeForce 460 GTX Superclocked SESamsung Spinpoint F3 5400rpm SATA 3Thermaltake Xaser III case (antique from 2003, but solid case, turns out it can fit anything up to 12x13 Inches in that case...I miss it)

I get to the desktop in about 8 to 10 seconds compared to about a minute with my old 7200 RPM Hard Drive.

$review_text.: It has been three years now since we purchased this little devil and it is still running great! The prints come out perfect on glossy paper (we're using HP premium plus paper) and when I say perfect, I mean they come out like you just ordered from the lab. These are really great pix!Now, a few caveats - First, it does accept bluetooth to print wirelessly. That's a great feature, but WiFi would have been better and given better range. The bluetooth adapter you're looking for if you want to print wirelessly from your phone or laptop is the BU-30. The BU-20 was the one they made to work with it originally but it was discontinued.Second, the plastic panels on the sides could have been better screwed on to prevent flapping. Actually they could be aluminum to make it more likely to survive a fall but that's another story lol. Anyway, they really get to rattling after a few years. I've put a little glue on them (there's nothing special under them to prevent this) and they're good as new.Finally, the lid and the paper eject "tray" stay closed via an interlocking clip. This clip wears over time and makes it difficult to get a good lock. You can add a dab of PVC glue on the clip to replace the part that wears off and it'll start working again like new. Ours only started slipping this year so that's three years of good hard labor.Overall it's a very nice little printer. Well worth the money if you're not the type that likes to wait on prints. Instant gratification.UPDATE: I forgot to add that if your pictures have runs or smudges on them then beat the kids. Chances are one of them has fiddled with the little grey "thickness" adjuster on the front of the printer and ran your paper up so that it rubs on the rollers. To fix just open the eject tray and move the grey lever all the way to the left. Then run a piece of paper through it on the "clean the rollers" setting. Then run the same piece of paper through it on the "clean the bottom plate" setting. Finally let it sit for 15-20 minutes to make sure any leftover smudged ink is dried. That should have you running 100% again.
$SUMMARY.: Great print quality - and it's portable! What's not to love?

The only reason I gave four stars is that the high end can sometimes be a little &#34;tinny&#34; sometimes is just a little &#34;shrill&#34; on some songs.  I read about this before purchasing on some Amazon reviews and got an equalizer app which is great.I found the Noise Cancelling feature was better than Bose and the Sony headphones were more comfortable as well.  Sony also had a better build quality.  The Bose put pressure on the ear drum, the Sony's did not.These are great for airplanes!A nice bonus is the carrying case.  Sturdy.

$REVIEW.: I just finished up my build and got the computer up and running this week. I've been enjoying some great PC gaming due to this card and I must say I'm completely sold on it. I watched the GTX 480 from the moment it came out knowing I was going to buy it. Then just before I did the GTX 580 was released. Even though the 580 is a great card and I give it major props I decided to go with the card that has a little more time on the market. This card has proved itself over and over to people and has been on the market long enough to get all the kinks out. So if your trying to decide between this card and the 580 I would say pick whichever speaks to you most, But whatever you do definately buy from EVGA. They are the best and their products are waaaay better than any other company. I have this card installed, drivers working and no issues what so ever on Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit and have not regretted not getting the GTX 580 at all.So my advice to you is, if you want a card that is supported with great drivers, runs flawlessly and is easy to install that will run everything on the market at highest settings, no doubt get this card. If you want to spend the extra money to show off to friends and brag about having the newest graphics card on the market get the GTX 580. Truthfully i had the money to buy the GTX 580 but opted for a  sound card. Disabling onboard sound adds about 7 frames per second in my build and makes my games rediculously loud and clear. I'm going to be purchasing another one of these cards to SLI with in the near future.

$review_text.: I needed to replace my old flat screen monitor, saw a ad for this monitor, and thought to check it out. The price was decent, found it on sale. So I picked up 2 of them for editing pictures using Photoshop.So far I love the LED feature, it's not and bright,and the screen is tac sharp. Very small bezel and a only about a 1" think make this a slim and very light monitor for 27".Took only minutes to assemble, just add the base, screwed it down. and place the monitor on top. The weight of the monitor hold it in the base. One odd thing, I bought 2 of the monitors to be used together, side by side, but they seem to be about 1/4" different height. Not a big deal, but couldn't get them the same height.One bit more serious issue, but not unexpected was that the black level were different on the two. So when you set them side by side, they, out of the box, had a different color tone to them. Even before turning on the PC you can tell the difference.  After calibration the issue was solved, just don't assume, if you buy two, that they will come exactly the same.Gorgeous monitors, love the nice LG red light at the bottom, very nice touch, you can adjust the light a bit in the menu. Talking about the menu; the buttons are on the bottom and are the touch type. You just have to touch the spot. The issue is that they are hard to use, because they are under the monitor, and in the dark, a pain to use. Again, not a huge deal, they couldn't put the buttons on the front because of the small bezel.On the back you have HDMI and DVI ports, along with the the standard D-Sub monitor port. You also have power port and a plug for speakers or a headphone jack if you're using the HDMI also for sound.Excellent monitor, very few issues, none very serious, highly recommended.

For those reviewers who complained they wouldn't power your laptop sound etc
that is not what they are for

They are great for what they do which is provide clear low volume sound without added power cords at the office, or other areas where you can't plug in, for my BlackBerry or my iPod


Anything with an electric cord in my workplace has to be tested and stickered for safety

These do not


They are durable having dropped them several times without problems


Hooking together when not in use allows one to wrap the cord around them for easy stowing in a desk drawer or briefcase


Can not beat them for the price.

Small and compact, freed up space on my shelf.  Movies load quick. Most impressive is all the internet things available.  I recently went with Amazon Prime (mostly for shipping) so I needed a player with that, but I had no idea there were so many other things available.  My previous players, an Insignia (BestBuy) and Panasonic did not have Amazon Prime.  Insignia was becoming useless because there are no software updates and some new BDs would not play; it had Netflix, CinemaNow, no Amazon, YouTube, etc.  The Panasonic is fine, slow to start, no Netflix or AmazonPrime, but YouTube.  Menus are easy to use, set up was simple simple simple.  I've always been a fan of Sony ever since my first stereo back in 1979!  Definitely recommend.

One star deduction because the sound is terrible - lots of background static.

$REVIEW.: Bought this combo a year ago for work use in office. It's in use 6-8 hrs a day, 5 days a week. For the amount of use, battery life is good. Loved the size of the micro USB receiver to connect both mouse and keyboard to Desktop. Plug and Play is correct, was up and running as easy as that. Software download available through Logitech website to install Logitech Setpoint, this helps with the onscreen indicators and shortcut key programming; aswell as battery life(s)status etc. I have owned many logitech keyboard and mouse combo's, only reason I buy replacements is just to update. I wouldn't spend too much on combo's simply because technology advances fast and as soon as you purchase that latest product an upgrade comes out. Glad that all the Logitech combos I've purchased cost me under $50 and have lasted for the amount of office use I put them through.

$REVIEW.: Great bang for buck.Pros: has a lot of features.First 2 units I received (one for car, one for truck) were bad & had to be exchanged.  Thanks to Amazon for fast turn around (2 days).  One had a bad DVD player "bad disc" with any dvd I put in. Also had a hi pitched whine on the bluetooth source.  Wouldn't go away unless I turned the car off & back on then quickly changed sources.  Second unit would constantly open the motorized screen & continue running the motor non stop. Frustrating since I had to spend several hours trouble shooting & removing the units.Received the 2 replacement units (overnight shipping, thanks again Amazon) and installed them. Some minor quirks but over all good.  Installed the 1st in my truck - the ipod cable sometimes doesn't play right channel audio.  Have to squeeze the adapter & wiggle it.  The 2nd installed in my wifes car, the 4gb sd card for gps was bad on arrival. Luckily I had ordered 2 & copied the software from the 1st sd card onto my laptop.  Then bought a new card at Walmart (also 4 gb) and pasted the information onto the new card.  Put it in & good to go.I'll be contacting the manufacturer for a replacement ipod cable and sd card.  Will also be asking about the map updates as all updating I have attempted thus far failed.Edit:I still haven't contacted the manufacturer for replacement of the defective items.  I'll be doing that Monday.Additional information - this was my first in depth DIY car audio/video install. I ended up around 15 hours per vehicle.  This involved the head unit, door & dash speakers/tweeters, rear view camera, subwoofer under seat & custom dash aux inputs (RCA for video, 1/8" stereo for audio).  If you have some electronic knowledge & are patient this isn't a terrible DIY project.  If you aren't electronically knowledgeable & a patient person ... I highly suggest getting this professionally installed.Have used them driving around town & on a 6 hour road trip.  I've noticed a few things.First - I wish the reset between touch screen presses was faster.  You can only press buttons so fast, about 1-2 times a second.  While this doesn't seem like a big deal, it makes a difference for those who want to turn the volume up/down quickly, cycle through pages on your ipod.Second - making and receiving phone calls.  If you have a disc playing, it will pause the movie to switch to the bluetooth feature.  If the call drops you have to wait 10-20 seconds before making the call again or your call will connect without audio or mic input.Third - sometimes the GPS data fails to load & throws an error.  Clicking yes will reset your settings.  Beware.This is a unit that is very affordable & offers many features.  There are some bugs.  For anyone well versed in windows & programming the Windows CE 6.0 environment can do some cool things.

$review_text.: **Another Update for iPhone performance**I recently purchased an iPhone 4.  To test the mophie, I discharged the phone completely.  I charged the mophie all the way, then plugged it into the iPhone.  It took about 3 minutes to charge the iPhone enough to be able to turn it on (about 5% charge).  I came back in an hour and the mophie was completely discharged and had given a 60% charge to my phone.**Update 12/6/2010**I had a friend try it on the iPad - he said he didn't notice a considerable difference in charging time.  I can't be certain if it does charge the iPad any faster, but at least in his perception, it wasn't clearly noticeable.  He said it did provide a full charge to the iPad.I've also tested pass-through charging and confirmed that when the Mophie is being charged it disables both the 30-pin charging port and the LED flashlight.**End of Update**The Mophie Boost is a good external choice if you primarily use Apple devices.  It's not compatible with other devices (i.e. those that use USB to charge).  This isn't really called out except in the product manual.  The micro-usb connection is for charging the Mophie itself - not for using the Mophie to charge other devices.  The one piece construction is convenient and it feels fairly solid.  It looks slick and the hidden LEDs are a pretty cool feature.  This makes it very easy to see approximately how much charge the Mophie has left.  Also, the LED flashlight stays on for 30 seconds at a time, which to me is more useful than having to hold down the button the whole time.  Overall, it provides a good amount of reserve battery capacity, though in my tests, it only reduced charge time of my nano to 2 hours vs. 3 hours.  While, I recommend the product, the price seems a bit high, and I wish it could be redesigned so as not to block the headphone port while charging.It does have an output that's twice that of USB, which is why they claim to be able to charge devices twice as fast. FYI, the unit's charging output is measured in amps (A) or milli-amps (mA).  1000mA=1A.  A usb connection can only output a max of 500mA, whereas the Mophie outputs 1000mA - this is how they claim it can charge your iPod twice as fast.  Since the Mophie has a total capacity of 1500mAh (milli-amp-hours, ie 1000mA for 1.5 hours), it can theoretically charge your device for 1.5 hours, which should be equal to 3 hours of USB charging (500mA x 3 hours).  Apple doesn't always publish their units' battery capacities.  So on my nano (g4) the manual says that it can get an 80% charge in 1.5 hours and full charge in 3 hours.I ran down the battery in my iPod until completely dead, connected it to the Mophie and let it sit for 1.5 hours.  The screen on the iPod still said charging, but when I disconnected it, the battery meter was full.  I reconnected it to the Mophie, and the iPod said it was fully charged.  The mophie's LED indicators showed 3 out of 4 still lit.  So I was able to fully charge the Nano using only about 25% of the Mophie's capacity.  On my second try, I again fully depleted the iPod's battery and let the Mophie go until the iPod said it was fully charged - this took almost exactly 2 hours for the iPod to state that charging was complete.  Again, one LED on the Mophie was used.  Overall, I was able to charge my Nano 3.5 times before the Mophie's battery needed recharged.  From these results, I can only conclude that while the Mophie is stated to output 1A, either it actually puts out a bit less than that, or the iPod itself can't absorb the charge that fast.  To be clear, though, the Mophie was able to charge the iPod faster than using the USB cable.In my personal use, the Mophie takes 3 hours to charge (which is as expected since a USB port ooutputs 500mA and the Mophies states it has a 1500mA battery).  Just to note, the Mophie doesn't support pass-through charging.  In other words, you can't have the Mophie connected and charging to a USB port and connect your iPod at the same time.Most noteworthy points:-----------------------*Overall, nicely constructed and packaged.*Built in LED flashlight is bright for its size*Came fully charged and ready to use right out of the box!*One piece construction - no caps, flip off covers or other pieces to lose or break.*Fully charged an iPod nano in 90 minutes using only 25% of the Mophie's capacity.*Outputs 1A, which is twice the output as a USB-spec connection (USB spec limits output to 500mA).Criticisms:-----------*The unit blocks the headphone port on my iPod (nano 4g - and I'd assume the 5g, too).  Therefore, you can't charge and listen at the same time.  With other devices where the headphone port is not located on the same side as the dock connector, this won't be an issue.  At present, most iPods will have this same problem.  On the iPad, if you have Apple's case on it, it will fit, but might have to squish it out of the way a little bit.*The indicator lights are on the opposite side of the unit compared to the direction the screen of an iPod Nano (4g) - therefore, while charging you'll have to flip the unit over if you want to see the charge remaining in the Mophie. It would have made more sense to me to flip the connector so that they both faced the same direction when connected.*The keychain connection seems prone to be breakable.*It charges using a micro-usb cable (provided), however given the size of the device a mini-usb connection would have been a better choice, since more devices use mini-usb and cables are more commonly found for mini-usb vs. micro-usb.*The slide mechanism is not very smooth - sort of makes a grating feel and sound.  It's a bit difficult to slide.*An iPod nano (4g in my case) is wobbly when connected.  Best to leave it on a flat surface vs. carrying it around.Physical Rundown:-----------------The Mophie Boost is larger than I expected.  Although it comes with a caribiner "keychain" I certainly wouldn't put it on my keys.  Attached to a belt loop, backpack, or bag is more likely.  It's can still fit in your pocket, but is too large to carry around all the time, in my opinion.  Also, the keychain bump on the unit seems strong enough for casual used, but feels like a large tug could break it apart - there'd be no fixing of this if it happened.I like the retractable connector - the slide mechanism is a bit stiff, but it's nice to get the connector out of the way, and there's no caps or extra pieces to lose.The black soft-touch areas are nice - smooth, but sort of rubbery.  The silver part is just plastic, but does look nice.  Just be aware it isn't metal.Unboxing:---------The Mophie is packaged in a visually similar style to other iPod accessories such as the universal dock.  The packaging is nice and keeps the product protected.  It is high quality and makes you feel like you've purchased a quality product considering the price of the unit.  No cheap plastic hard-to open packages here!To be clear, the LEDs on the Mophie only blink while charging the Mophie itself.  They do not blink while charging your iPod, nor is there any indication from the Mophie that charging has completed.Conclusion:-----------If you don't mind the size of the device and not being able to use your iPod while it's connected to the Mophie, then this is a good choice for you.  It's probably better suited to iPhone and iPad users for this reason.  However, for regular iPods, I'd rather take the extra time to charge and be able to use my iPod at the same time than to use the Mophie to charge it.

$review_text.: I had an old black pair of KOSS headphones that I loved.  The sound was clear, distinct, and true to the recording.  And they weren't some ultra-fancy expensive pro set, just something you'd find at Wal-Mart, etc.  I prolonged that set's life for as long as I could, but eventually they fell apart beyond repair.Upon seeking out a proper replacement, I thought why not go with the same brand?  Whatever equivalent product they have out now could only have improved over the years, right?  But no, I guess it's true what they say, "they don't make 'em like they used to."I got this pair in January '07.  I'm still using them reluctantly today.  I guess I can't say they're terrible, but what a drop in quality.  My old KOSS were extremely light and comfortable and fit well.  This new set really starts to hurt my earlobes after 20 minutes or so.  The sound is pretty muddy; especially the bass which is needlessly overdriven, making most songs just sound unbalanced.  They just feel cheap on the whole.

$review_text.: I got this because some of my disks got scratches on them that I couldn't get off.  I usually just use hand soap and water on smudges and stuff but there were some deeper little scratches.  So I got this because I heard good reviews on it and sure enough it did definately help those little scratches on the disk.  I am not so sure about huge scratches but if you have tiny not so deep scratches, it will blend them into the disc and you can actually see it done when your cleaning it.  For 20.00 and free shipping this is a pretty good deal.  I see they have a motorized one out which is nice, because you have to do 2 full turns on the disc and it goes quite slow.  Not sure if the price for the motorized is worth it though, I still think the hand one is better because your applying pressure kinda.

$REVIEW.: The only negative is that battery life is only about 3.5 hours or so but reliably at least 3 hours, almost that amount with WiFi and lowering the screen brightness. Fast enough, lasts long enough, reliable, solid build. Got rid of the internal drive for a SSD and this thing works very efficiently. Was bargain priced and so much better than the single core atoms with a pitifully painful standard resolution that required endless scrolling. Text is a tad small, admittedly, but if that's the price to pay it is WELL WORTH IT for the high resolution screen.Compared to other high end netbooks, not sure there was a better one out there last year.

$REVIEW.: As usual, a quality product from Sony. The fit over the ears is good and music sounds as good as it would with a closed ear headset. I have one big grouse being that I wear eye glasses. The headset is a crisp fit and pushes the eyeglass frame against my temple and that is painful over time. The second issue; though not vital, is that the extended cord is too long and the original cord is too short. Wonder how that happened for a company that prides itself on the minutae. Overall, I am very happy with my headset and have used it everyday for more than 2 years now.

Wireless range is about 8 feet, which is real nice when I get lazy, or I just want to lay back in my chair and mess around with my laptop without my lap heating up.  It's also much easier to clean than the earlier Logitech Trackballs.  The part I liked most was that you can leave the mouse switched on and it'll turn itself off when it detects that you haven't used it in a while.  Still on the original pair batteries after 4 months or so.

It works with wired and wireless at the same time; great! It was easy to set up after a small problem with the IE browser(of course). I just had to eliminate proxy server. Works with all my browsers and is "all systems go" so far. I like that it keeps the connection up continuously. You must use the MAC address last 6 digits for EACH new computer setup. That kind of threw me for a bit after I set up the initial password (I thought it would work for the next computer. Duh) The DirecTV box setup was nothing, just an ethernet cable and menu selecting "connect to internet". I will edit this review if I have any problems. I hope it lasts. For a hundred bucks, it'd better last!

$review_text.: I read reviews of other usb cardbus adapters where lack of power from the laptop to the device plugged to the adapter was a problem


 I can understand an ipod not getting enough power, but my Sandisk card reader?  I have a two year old Dell Inspiron 4150 with XP and SP1

 The single USB 1.0 plug built into the laptop started to become loose due to the dongle that's usually hanging off it (wifi adapter is usually plugged to the dongle)


 No problem I think, now I can upgrade to USB 2.0


 I ordered this adapter from Amazon based on the reviews

 XP recognized the adapter right away and required no additional downloads


 Next, I plugged my Sandisk card reader in but only a faint yellow light on the card reader lit up

 Suspecting that the little ac adapter might helped, I plugged it in


 If this thing worked on my card reader without the power cord I would have given it five stars

 To have to always be plugged in is a big handicap


 This concludes my review of this adapter and begins my short rant on my old laptop
 As I type this, my laptop has three wires connected to it 1) the power cord cause my battery is week 2) my lan line cause my wifi adapter isn't built in and I'm having usb  issues and 3) my new usb2.0 adapter needs it's own power cord!!!  To add insult to injury, my toddler ripped the "R" off my keyboard!!!  I think this is a sign to get a new laptop.

$REVIEW.: I originally purchased this item at a Big Name competitors Department Store for approximately $120 Bones for me and my Wife to put into our our Bedroom, My wife wanted and Blu-Ray Player w/ built-in-WiFi that had at a minium the NetFlix App

This Blu-Ray player had met her requirements and cost less than than the other Big Name Brand devices that had the same or more pre-requisits

Another reason I got this was that I have been very happy with the two VIZIO 32"inch 720p/1080i LCD T.V.'s that I had purchased 2 years ago and had no problems with them so I figured we would get the same good quality on thier Blu-Ray Player model, I was unfortunately wrong on that assumption.It basically started from the time I opened the Box and was doing the initial setup

As with all Blu-Ray Players all the configuration is done with the Remote Control, However this remote control is in no other words is just plain awful and a trial and turbaltion to operate (See Cons Below).PROS...The only 2 pros that I can honestly give the player is it did play Blu-Rays/standard Def DVDs with a decent picture and the Wifi did work with My WPA2 WiFi Network.Cons...Where do I begin?Lets Start with the most hated part of this player the Remote - In my entire 40 years of living on this earth this has to be thee (and I do mean thee) worst remote control ever built for any device (TV, VCR,DVD etc...)


It looks similar to thier TV remotes witch are easy to press and operate, this remote was like it's retarded evil twin
You had to press hard into the button on the control and you had a 50/50 chance of the player accepting the command


this is even more frustrating when trying to spell words to gain access to different parts of the blu-ray player

It's also supposed to fully finction as a TV remote as well (VIZIO Brand TV's only) but the only thing I could get to work on the TV was the sound.Construction - The player was big and Bulky which made it hard to place.Firmware Updates - when trying to updating the firmware it would keep erroring out and saying "Not able to connect to server" (Yes I checked my other Network devices and they were all able to get on the internet).The Apps - Again, difficult to manuver through (Remote) plus the box labels was slightly misleading


The only 3 apps that it comes with that was ready to was NetFlix,VuDu, and Pandora

You could only access the other apps (facebook, twitter, etc...) if you had an ACTIVE VuDu account.NetFlix - I was able to get NetFlix to initially work but the stream quality would be noticably choppy when watching a movie half the time.USB Storage - The Player would not properly format the USB drive for the storage required for the different apps, had to manually do it on one of my PC's.The Finale straw was on the 11th day is when out of nowhere the NetFlix app just pixalatted and was never apble to stream movies correctly again


I took the Blu-Ray Player back to the Big Name Department store and exchanged it for aPanasonic DMP-BDT210 Integrated-Wi-Fi 3D Blu-ray DVD Playerthat was approximately $40 bones more but well worth the money

Everything from setup to just operating the player was a breeze.The Moral of this? Just because a company is good at making one product does not mean they are good at making or should be producing another


The only thing I would recommend this item for is the people you cannot tolerate in your life and you just want to add to thier misery, for them I would recommend this product for

Other than that I would keep a wide berth from this Blu-Ray player.

$review_text.: Switch works as advertised with one major exception:  it will NOT pass HDCP copy protection protocol.What this means is that when I attached my DISH receiver to one of its inputs,  NONE of the premium channels would display

 An error message would appear that the TV (actually the switch) was not HDCP compliant


 Remove the switch from the circuit,  and premium channels like HBO and Showtime etc would all display audio and video.For $10 I won't bother returning it,  but if you have premium cable or satellite channels on your system, you'd be better advised to look at the Sewell switch which DOES pass the HDCP handshake protocol

$REVIEW.: There are two items, in my experience, that drop this item a couple of points:First, it will not register correctly unless the remote you are using is at least 6-7 feet away from the receiver.  This is true of 5 remotes of mine.Secondly, the emitters that are placed over the remote receivers on the equipment do not allow RF to pass through them.  So, if you are standing in front of the equipment, making adjustments for instance, pointing the remote directly at the RF eye of the piece of gear will not register since the emitter is blocking it.I did not have either of these issues with the Xantech systems I have used for years.  There were very unreliable for me so I wanted try a new brand.

This should be in every IT toolkit


It's a must for me

It has saved me so much time and energy


I love it

It turns just about any SATA/IDE device into a USB drive
I use it all the time to connect desktop/laptop hard drives to my laptop externally

These drives come up in Windows as if they are external USB hard drives
A less common use for it is to turn an internal DVD drive into an external USB DVD drive


So for example if you have a mini laptop or device with no optical drive and only USB ports, this could be an option if you have an internal optical drive laying around.

$REVIEW.: This system is replacing our old Altec Lancing computer sound system with subwoofer and two desktop midrange/treble speakers. I thought our old system was pretty good until it recently died of atherosclerosis at a ripe old age. The reviews of the Z623 seemed too good for a system priced so low, but we've had good experiences with other Logitech products.This system sounds better than I ever expected from our computer. We like many genres of music, but especially classical and opera. The first thing I tried on the speakers was Beethoven's 7th symphony. It felt like being front and center in a concert hall. The sound is wide ranged, balanced, and I could pick out individual instruments in many passages. Then I put on Chopin etudes. The sound is as rich and nuanced as listening to a live piano performance, amazing for anything that cost less then a thousand dollars.The sound is clear and clean as loud as I can stand it with no base rumble. A minor beef is that the base fades out to inaudibility at very low volume with the base control set in the middle.Packaging was excellent and setup is very easy. I found all cords easily long enough for our 6' wide desk, with the satellite speakers at the outer edges of the desk. We're tempted to buy another to replace our home theater system. We'd gladly give up the back speakers for the better sound. The midrange volume is more than enough for our large living room.Highly recommended.

This is by far the best.The case wraps under, then over the laces, so there is no need to tie it into your laces as some of the other cases do. This makes it easy to take off and use the sensor with other shoes or to wear your shoes plain.The case holds the sensor steady and the reading is very accurate. The lower down on the shoe you can wear the senor, the better. There is no fear of it slipping out at all. The case is also pretty stylish.  All black, with a silver "G". It's small also. I was concerned that it would be big and bulky, but this case is nither.For convenince and accuracy (and looks), I reccommend this case.

$REVIEW.: The difference in performance of a Solid State Drive (SSD) compared to a mechanical hard disk drive is astounding. It's the way to go for an OS/application drive where data reads are more demanding. Windows 7 boot times are cut in half compared to a 7200 RPM standard SATA HDD counterpart. Applications load lightning fast, and VM/swap is no sweat on a SSD. Over the years hard disk drives have been a major bottleneck in PC performance, SSD's are a big step in the right direction for solving that problem.The Kingston drive was a great deal at under $100. In another year this drive will probably cost half as much, but by then 1TB SSD's will be the standard. Hopefully SSD prices continue to drop as storage capacity increases. SSD's are starting to push into the 1TB range, so they should overcome the storage limitations which are the only reason mechanical HDD's are still the standard. However, mechanical HDD's will soon be a relic of the past, and it can't happen soon enough -- SSD's are quiet (no spinning mechanical parts), use less power compared to a standard HDD, and don't generate much heat. Due to their lower power/low heat operation, they are much more reliable than regular HDD's, which are especially failure prone after 4 or 5 years of regular use.As the title says, once you go Solid State, there's no going back. I bought this drive for my work laptop, now I'm ordering SSD's for every other laptop and PC/Mac that have in the house. If you have an aging PC or Mac that seems to run "slow", a SSD will give it quite a boost. It's a worthwhile upgrade, and much less expensive than upgrading to a new PC or Mac.

 The amp is very compact and looks very nice, but it lasted about a month


 When I replaced the battery in my vehicle, it blew the on-board 15 amp fuse, but not fast enough to prevent the amp from frying 2 channels


 The seller says contact the manufacturer, who says send us $20 and the unit for a warranty repair


 Paying 40% of the replacement price to have a cheap product refurbished?  No thanks


 I bought a JL Audio JX360 amp for $199 (by the way, this is 360 watts RMS, unlike the SSL which advertises Peak), and it sounds much better, much louder, much cleaner, and I'm guessing won't fry the board in 4 weeks

 Lesson learned - you cannot get $200 equipment for $50.

$review_text.: The important thing to realize with a camera like this is what you are buying
This is a camera that nicely straddles high level consumer handy cams and entry level pro work


 If you were ever shooting video on a DSLR and thought of how cool it would be to have that sensor in a video camera, that is the idea here

 With a 16 megapixel sensor shooting 2.1 megapixel HD video, you will get some level or moire when shooting scenes with lots of fine, straight lines (if corduroy makes a comeback, I guess I am doomed)


 This will be true of any video camera that takes high resolution stills, but is more noticeable on the larger sensor.But, and this is a big one, the larger sensor gives you a shallow depth of field very similar to super 35 (the film size most of your favorite older movies were shot in)
If you want to achieve that look, this is a good start

 You get zebras at 70 & 100 percent to help you dial in the exposure

 The focus peaking is an excellent aid for getting good shots


 Gain seems to be tolerable up to around 15dB.The kit lens is 18-200 (27-350 in 35mm equivalent), which is both wide enough and long enough for general shooting
 The image stabilization is built into these sand quite good

That said, the lens is heavy, weighing more than the camera
 You are better off shooting with two hands


 Of course, that is true with any camera, but the small ones have made people complacent


The kit lens goes from f/3.5-6.3


 I wish it were faster, but understand why it isn't


 Lenses with long zoom ranges don't come in F/1.4 without costing as much as a car


 You can get a few other lenses that are faster and weigh less


 Consider the Sony 50mm f/1.8
 The wider aperture will give you the shallow depth of field you want without killing your bank account.This camera does not have power zoom

 The zoom ring works just like a DSLR
 It has a bit of weight to it, but I like the feel


 While this makes zooming during some kinds of shots more difficult, zooming and shooting at the same time is generally to be avoided
 Watch your five favorite movies and count the number of shots where you see the camera zooming in

 If Vertigo isn't on your list, you probably won't even get to 1.A side effect of the manual zoom is good battery life


 The manual wheel isn't exactly where I would want it, but it isn't under the LCD door either

 I like the interface which gives me quick access to the features I most want (aperture, shutter, gain for me, but others on the list).You cannot take stills while shooting video

 It takes a little less than a second to switch from video to still mode or back

 The camera shoots in 24p, 60i, and 60p (NTSC)
 Note that 1080p60 is at 28 megabits per second if using the highest quality setting

 Your SDHC card might not like this even it it claims it is class 10


 Be sure to get one rated to 28 or more megabits if you want to shoot at maximum quality (and if you want to shoot lower quality, why do you need a camera in this price range?)


 I am on a Mac, and FCP X handles the data ok.Color is outstanding


Lowlight performance is solid, and will be better if you use a faster lens

 The microphone is good, even exceptional for an on camera mike, and it comes with a 'dead cat' to reduce wind noise

 It is still an on camera mike, and the laws of physics didn't change for Sony

 Use it if you need it, but a mike closer to your subject is better


 Luckily, there is a 3.5mm mike jack in the handle so you can plug in a wireless receiver.It is better in low light than the Panasonic HMC40 I had before or the Sony FX7

 It has clean HDMI out if you are looking at a hyper deck or similar recorder.Yes, the high end pro cameras have more features

 A low end pro camera will hit you for a lot more money- pretty close to double this at the low end.The only real warning I feel is important is the weight of the lens


 If you have a weak wrist or dealt with an RMI, this may be a concern

 Find one you can hold and see how it feels
 The video is great, though.

$review_text.: I have owned these headphones for about 1 year and 2 months.  The right side started giving out a couple weeks ago, so I bought another pair.These are nice headphone for the price.  The sound quality is good.  They are also comfortable on my ears, not too tight with adequate padding.I like to keep a pair of headphones at work and with these, I don't have to worry about them being stolen.  I use a nicer pair of headphones at home, but if you are looking for an inexpensive pair of headphones where you won't care too much if they break, are lost, or stolen, these are the perfect pair.

$REVIEW.: There seems to perpetually be some discussion regarding filters, no filters, expensive filters, cheap filters, on and on. Well, I personally believe in using filters, and going with branded, but cheap.Well, maybe not anymore.I've personally used a 67mm Tiffen UV protection filter for about 4 years. I recently purchased a EF-S 17-85 IS USM, and decided that instead of just buying another 67mm Tiffen, I'd invest in a B+W MRC filter and see what all the hype is about.This review is not about the physical protective characteristics of the filter, no review is done on the MRC coating of the B+W.The two filters are physically very similar, both are slim filters, and both feel very nice in the hand. The B+W has brass lettering (the filter itself is made from brass) while the Tiffen is aluminum, with enamel lettering. Both are very well built. The B+W is somewhat better labeled, with labels that are less likely to get damaged located on the inside of the filter ring. The Tiffen has slightly rougher knurling, and i lighter than the B+W, but the feel of the B+W is slightly better.When it comes to filters, we're most concerned about filter flare. I have noticed slightly better color depth on the B+W, but this is somewhat subjective and easily corrected in post-processing.If you choose to use a filter, the B+W is worth it. If you're not sure if you want to use a filter, I personally will continue to use my B+W. While i understand small scratches on my 70-200 are minor, I value the resale value of my lens, and I also work in the rain, with sand, and accidents happen - you will touch your lens one day. I would personally rather accidentally scratch my filter than my lens.Additionally a common cause of scratching is cleaning your lens with a speck of sand under the cloth. This can happen to anyone, and again, I'd rather scratch the filter than the lens.Also take a look at the images I've uploaded. I have also posted this review with the B+W.

$review_text.: I've brought most of my motherboard from Asus, and this has been the worst so far in terms of reliability

Not sure what the deal is with this board, but this is not the quality i expected from ASUS

I brought this during Sep 2012, now is April 2013


Last month the onboard usb-3 sockets failed, but wasn't critical so I ignored it, this month the on board sound card has failed, this I cannot ignore, so now I have to order a separate sound card until I figure out what to do with this

Now that two component has failed, who knows what will fail next


I guess I will have no choice but RMA the board, but RMAing a motherboard is a pain since that will put your machine out of action for a long while.

Logitech wireless mouse (I cant read the model the writing is too small)1) Plugged in the receiver... Windows 7 loaded all the driver correctly. Great I thought this will be a slam dunk2) Loaded the software unify program. Booted up. It found the receiver3) It says turn the device on and off... and it will register. Well my devices did not after many attempts.There is no help. It either works or it doesn't. I tried in several USB ports NADA. The ports are on the front of my computer. I put the mouse real close when trying to register.My issue1) Device Doesn't work (windows 7 and MX5500 keyboard2) The keyboard does NOT have a switch to turn on and off. How do i register this device !!3) The Logitech original software does not recognize this device either.4) When I went to the help site my webroot software said it has fishing issues !!!

I really want to like it but since the cover doesn't close all the way on it's own (there are no magnets to keep it closed) I'm returning this. Also, when you do have the band around the outside to keep the cover on...the cover still shifts around and takes it the Nook out of sleep/wake mode.  The GMYLE case I have right now uses magnets and feel more secure (and doesn't slip) even though it doesn't have an outside band around it.

$review_text.: I've had this battery set for under 30 days and used it for one afternoon.If GoPro's extended life battery would cheaper that would be the better alternative. But for the price, it is really tough to beat this deal. Each battery lasted me about an hour of on-and-off use while using the wifi remote and the app for a little while (the app is better as a post review option than for recording action).The fact that you get a car charger, wall charger and European adapter tip that are also compatible with the original battery, well, I've looked and can't find better alternatives FOR THE PRICE. Granted, the chargers and the wrapping on the batteries feel cheap, but who cares. Even it fails in some way, it's so cheap I would buy another set. I chose this over the Wasabi option because numerous reviews online showed that the Smatree gets a few more minutes and runs a few degrees cooler.***** DISCLAIMER *****:I have over 10 years experience in IT and technical support, troubleshooting and sales for higher end and specialty users. Traditionally 3rd party batteries are not tested for longevity. They are created to initially provide the most similar charge to the original product for the least amount of dollars. I would not be surprised if after 6-12 months the battery charge life decreased by 50%. FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN, this is pretty typical when you see a 30-day warranty on the battery. If you see 1-year, that usually means it stacks up against the original very closely. BUT, as I said, FOR THE MONEY, it would be worth it to just buy another set later, even though being such a consumerist is bad for the environment.

It actually was a whole floor above my router in my 3 story house, and still it sent a weaker signal than my router in the basement.....  Would highly recommend steering clear of this item, it just doesn't do what it is supposed to do, pure and simple.  I know others have said the same thing, but I still tried it anyway.....

There are no instructions that come with this lens so from the start, make sure that you twist of the macro lens to separate it from the fisheye lens.  Then you can use both adapters correctly.The pictures are sharp with both lenses and I think I'll be using this more often than I originally thought.  Great price and the accessories it came with were an extra bonus.Thank you!

$review_text.: I know this was designed for the ipad 2 but i actually got it for a netbook.  I liked how the neoprene seemed able to absorb the shock if I dropped the netbook, which it did on more than one occasion.  Well, since I got this case, my wife decided that it would be a good idea to get an ipad 2.  We sold the netbook and now keep the ipad in this case.  I think my only problem with this case is that it is an envelope of sorts.  It does not open completely to allow use while in the case.  It just allows you to slip it into the case.  Also, it is real tight if you have a case around the ipad that contains a keyboard.Anyway, that is my review.  I still like the case and would recommend it highly.

This is apparently also the very largest spacing that you can get away with for this design. Also, there seems to be a typo. Although the product page here displays a weight limit of 66 pounds, the side of the box says 55 pounds. Shouldn't be a problem for the standard range that this product supports, but there it is.However, it's a very sturdy build and I have no doubts that my 40&#34; TV is safely secured on our living room wall.

$review_text.: The concept behind this product is great, however the execution is poor. The connections inside the two ends are very poor--the cable isn't well secured. Perhaps with some scotch tape wrapped around the parts where the cable goes inside the housing would've helped it last longer. The problem is that tension and twisting on the cable messes up the internal connections, causing it to fritz in and out.I'll probably buy another one and try fixing it with tape. It'll probably work better the next time with tape. :) It's hard to beat the price.

$REVIEW.: My wife spends most of the day on long conference calls from her home office.  She works every day and until now we have not found a headset that works well for both speech and hearing;  and is comfortable.  This one does it all really well!  It is easily worth the price. Now I want to buy one for myself!  Thanks Amazon.UPDATE... 1/18/2012... I just got the same headset for myself.  I just have to comment that for a headset that is advertised for use in a noisy environment it seems funny that the instructions say "use your headset in a quiet evironment with low background noise". Ha!  But it is a good headset --  loud and clear and comfortable.  Just don't try to put it on too quickly, it is a little bit of a bother to get it just right.UPDATE... 1/25/2012...  I purchased a Gigaset One and later found out that Siemens no longer supports the Gigset One device.  Go to XLink for the same product but with outstanding customer support! XLink offers software/firmware updates for the XLink.

 Turns out my mb does not have a way to go into sleep mode with windows 8.1 
 I would really love to just get a mb that would work properly as this version of windows uses very little power in sleep mode I am told and this is a feature I would like to take advantage of


 sadly I cannot


 if I (or you) ever get a new mb, this version of windows cannot be used

 I should have spent the extra $20 and gotten the retail version
 now that is not even an option
 my only options are to stick with the build I have, or buy 8.1 all over again

$review_text.: Well constructed case, I would recommend this for anyone that has an iPod Classic. It fits snugly and I've never had a problem with it. The inside material might scuff up the iPod but I would not know that because my iPod has iWrap on it. It is sturdy and has never failed me. The only problem is the clip for the belt cannot withstand being taken on and off, eventually the psuedo-leather on it has come apart and makes the case hard to clip on at times. For the price you cannot argue. Would buy again, probably will after the case has given out.Sincerely, iSklcndykid

$REVIEW.: My home office doubles as a mini-gym. So I am at my workstation for telecommuting, gaming, and sometimes (rarely) watching digital-broadcast TV. I wanted a full-HD monitor, so I decided to upgrade from my 22&#34; NEC monitor to this.I am very glad I did. Here's how I set mine up:+ Connected my PS2 via A/V (I cardio using Dance Dance Revolution on my PS2)+ Connected my basic indoor HDTV antenna via Coax+ Connected my background mini-server via VGA+ Connected my main PC workstation via DVII can easily switch sources using the nice little remote control, the monitor has a sharp (full-HD) image with great color (I barely had to adjust any settings), and it's rock solid on my desk. No complaints.

$review_text.: For the price it works well. The detent is a little shallow so you must make sure you are in the detent. Also the phillips screw holding the assembly must be checked as it will loosen and spin. Don't over tighten as it will hinder your moving to the next detent. However, for the price it is more than worth it. The software is really outdated and will not work with Vista or Windows 7.

$review_text.: This drive has the same beautiful, soft rubber covered chassis as their other MAC versions that come with their non-thunderbolt bases.  It really is fantastic aesthetically; seems like that doesn't matter much, but worth noting.To make it clear, you need to buy a different Seagate base if you want it to run on USB - this particular version ONLY has Thunderbolt ports.Interesting that one reviewer noted that one can use their docks to dock other hard drives - at least internal drives.  I hadn't noticed before, but instead was always somewhat annoyed that although they use standard SATA ports, the female ports on the actual Seagate drives are actually recessed and off to the side so that you cannot use the drive with a third-party dock, and therefore have to buy their bases, making the whole set up what I term "semi-proprietary".The bottom part of the actual dock is thinner than their other docks, with the part off to the side (to house the extra circuitry?)  That is kind of a shame, but may get smaller with time.In this case, I was actually impressed with Seagate's online support (I usually don't need help with such matters): when I formatted this to NTFS, I quickly realized that Windows 64bit and even Paragon 2010 (out of date) have all kinds of issues with drives over 2.2TB, and surprisingly, Seagate's website had all the information listed concisely, and offered a free tool to format the drive and it now reads easily on all my Win7 computers.  I was in a rush at that moment, so I'm grateful I didn't have to do further research.Like others have said, I am still a bit skeptical of diving into brand new technologies very early, so I'll let that be your judgment call.  I usually give standard drives a four, but I guess I'll go with a five this time because I thought Seagate's support was quite adequate when I actually needed it.

$review_text.: I ordered 5 of these for our offices at work - everyone LOVES them for the following reasons:  1) remote control - although  thought to be a bit excessive at first, the remote has come in handy when other staff enter and office and don't care for the "breeze" or when the telephone conversation requires a bit more effort to hear, one can simple adjust the fan or turn it off instantly, without leaving the telephone call or making the office visitor feel uncomfortable with overt actions; 2) QUIET...all five of our fans are extremely quiet during fixed or oscillating use; 3) small footprint - other than the base (about 10 inches each side), the unit is so small (about door handle height), that it is easily placed without fear of obstruction; 4) the TIMER!!!  No need to worry about getting home from the long day at the office and worrying about the "electric item" still running - we've had coffee pots left on overnight that posed major hazards - although the fan isn't a heating instrument and running it overnight wouldn't be cause for concern, the ability to set the timer and know it will turn off is comforting; 5) the price....far, far less than we've paid for the standard "institutional" fans and a far, far better value.  The cons, few that there are, are very minor - putting the thing together entailed just a few steps, but required the unit to be turned upside down...I dropped one on it's "head" and cracked the exterior (however, it made no impact on the fuctions!) and the other con....they tend to walk off by themselves...as in, we've already lost two to "mysterious circumstances" (another office?).  Side note:  so impressed were staff with these that four staff purchased these for their homes.  Yes, we're all happy campers :)

$REVIEW.: Since the screen is not replaceable, keeping it scratch free is important to me

The anti-glare feature it adds is a big plus around overhead lights (such as in the office)

I use the same type of thing on my Kindles, too
Never had a problem with either, works great with stylus, S pens and fingers.Tips:  Because of the larger surface area, dust specks & lint are almost impossible to minimize
 I used the blue painters masking tape to lift off the small stuff that got stuck on the screen protector and then reapplied it
 Don't use anything sharp like a needle or toothpick as that will scratch the protector

It took me a few tries to get the protector the way I wanted
 I have 2 tablets so the first one was the trial and error, the second went on much easier.One thing to note, it did not come with the card to smooth the bubbles out
 Used a plastic card (not quite a credit card) which worked just as well.

$REVIEW.: We have bought two of these covers for our Kindle touches.  They are certainly nice for the price and appear to be pretty durable.  It provides good protection for your kindle and looks nice - kind of like a small leather-bound book, although I'm pretty sure these are faux leather.I liked the old keyboard kindle way of fastening the cover with a couple of small concealed metal hooks, but the touch does not have this feature.  The "real" cases for the touch I seen have you press-fit the kindle into a kind of rubber recess, which I find is klunky and heavy.  So I would recommend this case even though I don't like to have straps going across the corners to hold the kindle into the cover.Update on this review:  The case functioned very well until it fell apart at about 6 months old.  This was no due to abuse, just moderate use.  I guess you get what you pay for.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this USB hub to replace another hub I was using that was not meeting my expectations.  The OLD hub didn't have enough power to run my devices.  The Plugable USB hub definitely replaced it very well!  I have no problems with power and there were no dead ports.  I like the glowing blue light on the hub that indicates it has power (my old hub had no indicator it was receiving power).  The two flip up USB ports worked perfect for me as well.The only negative is that the hub is fairly light.  I have all my permanent devices plugged into the back and leave the front hubs open for portable storage and devices.  The cords pull on the hub and cause the front to raise into the air.  I'd imagine this would be resolved when I have more things plugged into the front.All and all... I'd definitely recommend purchasing this item.

$REVIEW.: I ordered this package from amazon (128GB Win7 HP, dock & keyboard), and the package I received had been haphazardly taped together with packing tape - and the dock & keyboard were nowhere to be found
I called amazon up and they cross-shipped me a new one - this time it was all correct - and hadn't been apparently rifled though


A+ for Amaon customer service.On to the tablet: I have been looking for a tablet with this kind of horsepower for quite some time, then I stumbled upon the slate by accident one day - and bought it immediately


Then, I read some reviews ([...]) and there are a couple of issues with QC, perhaps - but overall, an excellent tablet.I love the 11.6" display form factor - I have had the 11.6" MacBook Air for >1 year and love it


It is bright, clear, easy to read - and has really good viewinig angles


Samsung has put a custom touch interface over W7 - and it works wonderfully - I did made scroll bars/exit buttons a bit bigger since i have fat fingers, and that solves most of my problems

The calibration was great out of the box, and it is a pleasure to hold and use in general
 Many people have reported the glass separating from the unit due, perhaps, to an adhesive issue (and some are saying that the dock may exascerbate it), and mine does have the issue slightly - but I will wait to get it replaced when it becomes a serious issue.The touch-launcher is a great interface, especially as  you can replace many of the stock garbage apps with your own


The physical 'home/windows' button has several uses, to launch the touch-launcher, navigate through windows (same as win-tab), and show the desktop (win+d) - and if you want - you can remap any of these options to do different things


For instance, I don't care about the 'show desktop' feature  -and instead rigged mine to toggle between activate/ignore the touch-screen input - so that only the pen can give input - helpful when exclusively writing/inking
The pen is a nice, fairly standard wacom pen


I wish you could modify the button/click actions more.My unit does have the sim-card slot door - it doesn't apear to be removable, even if I wanted to add the 3G card later, bummer
All the other buttons, ports work as expected.The keyboard is a pleasure to use, same feel as my mac keyboards


I did have to go into the device manager and tell the computer NOT to turn the device off to save power

Prior to this, even a pause of 5 minutes without typing would cause the keyboard to disconnenct, and maybe 5-10 sec
of reconnection before it would register a keystroke


In general, it works well


The '5' key on my keyboard is broken, and nearly falling off - I'll have to send it back to samsung to get a replacementThe cameras are just OK, nothing terribly impressive, and have quite poor low-light output.The tablet does come with some bloatware, but some of the native apps, like the samsung "Easy Software Manager' is very useful

Swype is very useful, and can be resized to your liking - I love it on my android phone


The factory partition setup is bizarre - 50GB for the OS, 50GB empty partition, and a 20GB hidden recovery - I just copied the recovery partition to an external HDD, and made 1 big partition.The battery life seems great to me - i've easily gotten >5hrs out of a charge - but I'm usually not doing anything serious - and keep the backlight low (~10%)
I will use this for matlab, and other hardcore purposes - but will likely be docked - but the i5 should handle it nicely.Enough rambling, all in all, I love this tablet.



$SUMMARY.: Thanks Samsung! Great i5 Win 7 Tablet!

$review_text.: I purchased it for my computer setup, then didn't need it because the PC could do the audio through HDMI
Also, there was actually no toslink input on the TV

I didn't check this before I got the TV and cable in the same order
So I had it sitting in the closet for a few months because it would cost half as much to return as the price of the item

Then my parents got a new home theater system and needed digital audio from their cable box to the receiver


I had this cable, so no one had to run out and pay triple from a big box store


They are happy with the performance, so I'm happy


Amazon's probably happy that they didn't have to deal with a return
BlueRigger is happy because they're getting 5 stars.The only people who aren't happy after the publishing of this review are Monster Cable
Sorry guys, but you'd stolen enough money from us over the years with your overpriced A/V snake oil.

$review_text.: The Good: I bought this TV set after much research and viewing every set I could online and at the stores. This set beat out Samsung and Sony models in its class, and was hundreds less. This set has great audio speakers that adjust to loud volumes such as commercials. Black levels are great. Colors pop. Skin tones are spot on. This set is more "tweakable" than others. You can elect to have antiblurring without dejudder. I looked side by side at several stores to compare this model and it is superior to Sony and Samsung pq. Bigger is better. I don't have room for a 46 inch and this 42 inch beats out the 40 inch sets.The Bad: I was unlucky and my set had two dead pixels right out of the box. After two months, I got a second set, exact same model. The second set had audio lip syncing problems on one channel and buzzing sounds once a day. The dead pixel set had no audio problems. I ended up keeping the dead pixel set. The fine print under the Toshiba warranty says if you get one dead pixel or 100 dead pixels, it is not covered under the warranty. I can't see my dead pixels unless there is a white background and I look for them. This set is perfect in many ways, except not pixel perfect.It was a bad experience to start out with, to have two sets, the same model with problems.

$review_text.: I was sceptical about buying an SSD. Especially after so many claims of their reliability issues popped up over the internet.I bought the 330 as a christmas gift for myself, installed the OS on January the 26th 2013. As of July 1st the same year, I haven't had a single issue with the drive, considering my PC runs 24/7 for most of the time and I sometimes host servers for older video games. The OS boot time on Windows 7 64 bit is approximately 23 seconds. That said, my BIOS throws a CPU FAN error, my bad luck for using a low-rpm CPU, and I can't disable the alarm. That steals about 4 seconds out of the boot time. That said, before that CPU fan started causing problems. I'm sure that without some of my startup programs I could squeeze out a second or two more. Thing is, on my Western Digital hard drives (first WD1001FALS then WD1001FAEX) we're both way over 45 seconds after a few months.Loading times improved dramatically for everything on the drive. For example my internet browser launches immediately. The system is a lot more responsive than it ever was on the previous HDD's. Now the fun part. I'm still on SATA2 (3Gbit/s). The 330 SSD's do get a bit faster on SATA3 (6Gbit/s) as I tested the drive on a different motherboard and benchmarks from AnandTech confirm that. They also confirm the degradation of NAND memory is not as big as it seems and the drives should last for many years.In my opinion SSD's are the perfect drive for your OS, both Windows and Linux (crunchbang! 11 and Xubuntu 13.04 we're even more responsive) and even with the current prices are worth their money for what they do to your experience. No longer does the sound we know so well, especially loud on WD Black drives, inform you about the struggles of reading data from a spinning platter. Now with the solid states drives, silent, nearly instant, blazing fast magic.I never ran into any trouble with the drive, it worked right off the bat. Intel SSD Toolbox works just fine as a utility tool for the 330. Makes it easy to schedule TRIM, likewise for checking for updates and firmware updates if needed. Overall I had absolutely no issues with the drive.I just love it. It does what it suppose to, does it well and I'm satisfied.

$review_text.: I was curious about the Vivitek brand since it's a fairly new name, at least to me. Last time I researched for projectors was probably back in 2002~2003 when the popular Infocus X1 first came out. Turns out the transformer manufacturing giant, Delta Electronic is actually behind the Vivitek brand. Delta(based in Taiwan) supplies excellent power transforms for major computer OEMs such as Apple, Dell, HP and Xbox. So there's a good chance that you are already using a Delta product right now. So there, a little background about the brand. And now you can be rest assured knowing that 3 years down the road when you need to replace that projector lamp, the company will still be around.

I'd rather have the faster capability now than find out later I really needed it.

$review_text.: Fantastic deal for this 4th Generation core i3 4130CPU in a entry level server chassis with 280 watt 80 plus Power Supply, 4GB DDR3 1600, 3 free ram slots, dual x16 slots, and DVD Rom Drive. Just add Hard Drive (and RAM and Video card) and go!Well built, quick access chassis, modular system. Drive trays, pre-run sata and power cables. Quiet, hardly a whisper from the 2 chassis fans, the cpu fan or the power supply fan. only hear the hard drive I added! Also supports i7 and Xeon processors as an upgrade option.Odd 14 pin power connector on motherboard, adapters are available for a 24 pin standard power supply that supposedly work, however the system is low power use with an efficient power supply so you can use up to a Radeon 7750 no problem. The integrated 4400 Graphics are admittedly not half bad if you don't need that.There is no PCI-e power connectors, so if you want a more power hungry video card than that 7750 you will need either a higher wattage power supply with the adapter cable, or forgo a hard drive sata power cable and buy a sata to pcie power cable adapter.Windows 7 drivers available from lenovo's site makes this a nice budget gaming rig, easily quadrupling performance over a core 2 duo or Athlon 64 x2. I may buy a 2nd one, would recommend to anyone...UPDATEI'm an IT guy and have also bought one of these as a test platform at work, as well as own this i3 version and the Xeon e3 1225 v3 for home - the deal was that good, I had to get 2.Out of the box draws about 20w idle, 65w load.It does run a Radeon 7750 2GB video card flawlessly with the included power supply! 32w idle, 97w load in this config with a single 2.5" hybrid HD...The 14 pin to 24 pin power supply adapters work, if the power supply is 24 pin, has a 12v 4 pin connector, and is of higher amperage per rail than the lenovo ps! Works with an older generic 585watt I had...Running in the work environment with an SSD and this machine is faster than many of our $1000+ xeon based dell precision workstations in our office applications and general use, for under $500 (+SSD, + OS, + RAM). The Xeon W3520 or better based machines do a little better in data centric heavy I/O multi threaded apps like our data processing team uses, but the i3 easily wins in single threaded apps like MS office.Intel management card is fantastic at this price point!Will be buying more - great upgrade for someone on a platform 4+ years old. If you know what you are buying in advance, you can't go wrong.

$review_text.: This hooked up perfectly to my iPad mini.  I'm a touch typist, so I opted to get one of these instead of trying to use a really mingy keyboard/cover that fits the mini.  Being a touch typist, I was curious how this would feel.  It's different feel than a standard keyboard, as one would expect for something this thin and light.  The keys have more of a clicky feel - very different than the logitech computer keyboard I'm using right now.  But I found that was not an issue.  I was able to touch type just fine.  I see what looks like the same keyboard sold under numerous labels.  I suspect they are all the same.

$review_text.: I've been a big fan of the Sabrent all-metal USB 3 enclosures, so when it was time to house my 12.5mm drive (Seagate FreePlay 1.5TB), I chose this enclosure.Like the other Sabrent enclosures, the USB 3 interface is super-fast (reaching over 80MB/s read and write with the Seagate drive).However, the case design isn't so hot


The upper and lower metal plates are held in place by short metal tabs on one end, and 2 small screws on the other


The tabs aren't very deep, so I found that the plates easily pop off near the tabs.Worse yet - despite being advertised as a 12.5mm case housing, it can't quite fit my 12.mm Seagate drive


The lower plate is fine, but the upper plate is about 3mm too short


If you don't mind wrapping black electrical tape around the enclosure, it will at least house and protect a 12.mm drive


But not elegant or as advertised.

$review_text.: Bought the WX150 camera as an upgrade to a few year old Panasonic point and shoot of similar size. I went with the Sony because of it's supposed speed and better low light abilities and 1080 video.The low light photos are better, but with way too much noise reduction. They look like paintings in many shots. The video is much better. The 10X zoom is convenient. But the camera is not all that fast. There's no sport scene option. The super intelligent auto mode takes forever to process every photo taken. The P mode suffers from poor and inconsistent exposures. The AF tracking has a mind of its own. It rarely hits and tracks what you want it to unless you're zoomed in or really close so nothing else is in the frame. It needs to start in the middle of the frame to make it easier to track what you want. Continuous shooting is limited to 10 frames. Processing is slow.The zoom control scales WAY too fast. Nearly impossible to get the zoom you want, plus it flies through to the "intelligent" zoom way to easy. The OIS is not that effective especially in video.The screen I would rate as below average. Very difficult to see in the day and not very sharp for 460K. It also smudges something awful and is difficult to clean. The build is really lightweight flimsy feeling plastic. Which is good and bad. Good that it's really light, bad in that it doesn't feel like it will last long. My Panasonic is mostly metal and not that much heavier. I've run out of room but the list goes on....**** UPDATE 3/2013 ****Please note that the WX150 has stock that is being depleted at many other online retailers.  At this point i would wait until the WX300 is available as it is the successor to this one with very similar features and twice the battery life.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BEHQKPW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B00BEHQKPW&linkCode;=as2&tag;=stupisms-20Or just go all in and get the RX1... if I only had the cash...http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0097CXFCC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B0097CXFCC&linkCode;=as2&tag;=stupisms-20

$REVIEW.: I have flown Helicopters and Quads for a few years now. The DJI PHANTOM is my best drone period. The features for the cost are much more reasonable than building your own quad and setting it all up. I love the FPV fat Shark system I installed in the DJI now as I can fly it like a drone. The GoPro 3 camera I put on it required a gimbal to get the quality I wanted in videos.So if your after a great Drone or Quad this is the one. The GPS safety system has saved me twice now and it works as designed. The system is not cheep but if you are doing RC stuff the cost of crashes and parts become a thing of the past. If you are an RC person you know what I am saying it is so cool to look at improvements to your DJI Phantom and not worry about the parts you need for the next crash. One word of caution read the manual learn the GPS system and the go home aspects. Check your systems on take off and your going to have the DJI Phantom for years to come.
$review_summary.: This is the best product for the cost on the market.

$review_text.: I have a bunch of wireless and wired connections on the network, including things like Netflix streamers, printers, a VoIP adapter and multiple computers


 They all worked without issue upon installation of the router, which was also quick and straightforward
 That is a first in my experience

 Connections on the laptops boot quickly, but not quite as instantaneously as with my previous router
 That is the only issue I can think of, and it is not particularly significant since it is only a couple seconds on start-up


 The price was a big draw, too, relative to many of the routers out there.Edit 3/11/13:  It is hard to pinpoint issues with wireless connectivity, but it appears that this router is the source of dropouts/disconnects


 If I go back to my old wireless G model, the problems stop
 Also, over time, the lag between opening the laptop and connecting to the Internet has become annoying
 I am thus reducing my rating to 3


 If I was certain the Medialink modem is the issue, I would lower the rating more.

It supports the new serial ATA3 6 gig interface for added speed for those with the most up to date computer as of the day of this review. Mine isn't as fast, so using SATA2 3 gig hardware.Operation:The HD powered up fine, I formatted from Win Vista 64 setup as one large partition & so far in the past two weeks it's been running well & consistent even with a lage amount of files. It runs also very quietly, which is surprising considering it's immense speed & capacity. The drive is in reasonable temperature range with use.Speed:So far this is working well, the speed is great. I can write a 4.15 gig file in under 40 SECONDS.Conclusion:I recommend this drive, the performance is great, with fast speed, great reliability & quiet operation.Will definitely update this review if there are any issues.

$REVIEW.: After my analog SD video repeater died after 3+ years of faithful service - (RF Link AVS-5811 5.8GHz Audio and Video Transmission System with IR Repeater- transmitting the SD signal of my HD DVR I decided to upgrade to an HDMI repeater.I used this to transmit the signal of an older DirecTV Tivo (HR10-250) with HDMI capability to my bedroom about 100 feet away


 The first thing I noticed is that the instruction sheet is pretty thin

 There's sync buttons on the transmitter/receiver (supposedly to pair one to the other) but no discussion of this on the instruction sheet

 I tried pairing the two and both flashed orange LEDs for about 2 minutes doing nothing with them right next to each other before I gave up and power cycled both and hooked them both up.The second issue I ran into is that the unit can't handle a 480i HDMI signal (Which the HR10-250 will transmit)
 Again, the manual is thin on this and after some trial and error I realized that upping the resolution made the signal appear on my remote TV..
success!It took some more trial and error to discover that the remote included in the box controlled a UI menu system for the repeater which would allow me to configure which 5ghz channel spectrum I wanted to use (great for trying not to interfere with my 802.11ac router).Otherwise, the video looked good.My HR10-250 will also record over the air HDTV signals and, content with my purchase, I switched the TV over to watch one of those channels and got..
silence..


switched to a SD channel and got audio again, then to another HD channel and..
silence..


Knowing that HDTV uses Dolby Digital to transmit audio sometimes I checked a recording of Game of Thrones (which is broadcast in Dolby Digital) and also got..


silence..

SD recordings (which are recorded in basic stereo play fine, but any recording with Dolby Digital or DTS is not relayed by this unit.And that's a dealbreaker for me so back to the store it went
 if you're going to use this to hook up a projector while audio is played by a separate amplifier then this will probably fit the bill for you
 However I went instead with theIOGEAR GW3DHDKIT Wireless 3D Digital Kit with Full HD 1080P and 5.1 Channel Digital Audioand I'm actually finding it a better overall product (missing some nice configuration features the My Wireless TV has but the iogear can be turned off and it will do Dolby Digital audio relaying.

$REVIEW.: I was not pleased with the recent announcement by DirecTV that rates are going up AGAIN.  Year after year, the rates keep going up and the programming gets worse and worse.  Out of 200+ channels that we are paying over $85 a month for we watch maybe 5 of them.  Of course they manipulate their packages so that you have to buy the top package to get the most popular channels people watch.  So after the recent price hike announcement I wanted to find a way to tell them "so long, and goodbye" and I remembered Leo Laporte on his TwiT network had mentioned the Roku box.  So I started doing a bit of research and before I knew it I had one arriving at my door.Setup was a breeze - if it took me more than 5 minutes I would be surprised.  You will need to make sure you have your computer ready because you will need to enter a code during setup.  Other than that, it detected my wireless network just fine and after I entered my security key for the wireless network it proceeded to self-update and reboot and was ready to rock and roll in less than 2 minutes.The channel selection is good, not great, but good.  It's good enough for me anyway.  I am subscribed to Netflix and Hulu Plus, though I doubt I'll keep Hulu Plus as the content available isn't very good.  I also enjoy the Weather Underground channel and the gay and lesbian channel.  Flickr has some potential, but you can't free text search yet.  Youtube is missing, though a private channel exists that brings that functionality over to the box.Streaming has been an absolute breeze.  I have 6MB DSL from AT&T; and I've been picking up full quality HD streaming without interruption or buffering.  I can still surf the web at the same time and it isn't causing a problem at all.  I'm very impressed at how well the Roku handles streaming.  When I'm watching a standard def stream it consumes about 1.5mbps of bandwidth; the HD stream is taking up about 3.8mbps or so.I had the Roku HDS running for about 4 hours before I called DirecTV and cancelled our premium services and two of our four receivers.  We are keeping two receivers for the time being, but the moment CBS starts offering a channel on the Roku it will be game over for DirecTV.  CBS is the only reason we are keeping DirecTV for the time being.In short, this is the future of television.  I couldn't be happier, and I am going to order a second unit for our television downstairs as well.  Who knew that a box this inexpensive could deliver such great quality and value.  I have no doubt as they continue to expand their channel lineup that Roku is going to make a lot of people really think hard about how much they need cable or satellite TV.  Many people, like myself, are just tired of paying more and more for less and less.  With Roku you pay a little, but you get a lot -- with more coming every month!

$REVIEW.: I purchased the Clip+ to replace an old cell phone with FM function which I only used for news radio when outside or working out(I didn't otherwise use this phone for anything else)


I searched for an FM capable MP3 player


My two criteria were an FM radio and just enough of an MP3 player to play my favourite workout music for at least an hour or so
I have an older iPod, but that is larger, heavier, and more music than I want to take out on the road


I looked at this model because it was a best seller, although I would have preferred the percentage of five-star reviews to be higher compared to one-star


My perception of the poor reviews was partially quality control (or the claim of it to justify returning) when compared to the consistent contrast with the positive reviews


Some of the reasons I chose this the Clip+ was the size of the player, the low price, and the expansion capability if I wanted more storage

So, this is my hyper portable auxiliary player with a FM radio, not my main MP3 player

It fits that role exceedingly well.I ultimately purchased an open box clearance item for $10 less

It arrived in more packaging than I expected: book-sized box and loose inside plenty of plastic foam filler, but this was "open box" so that does make sense if Amazon doesn't need smaller boxes to justify a smaller box
I don't thing a padded envelope may have protected the player otherwise

There was no CD, but the software is available online, so there was no wasted plastic there.Short USB cord, which is only an issue since my desktop is set back, but I already have a longer chord plugged in for four other products with the same plug


Windows 7 recognized the player immediately

I used Media Player to manage the songs I loaded


I don't otherwise use Media Player, but iTunes did not appear to be an option


I had no problem quickly making up a playlist and syncing with the player
Since all I want is to play a simple playlist, navigation and searching for specific songs has not been an issue


I do like how the home menu scroll loops, so I done have to reverse direction if I hit the top or bottom.FM reception is better than expected
Setting presets is easy (I should mention I'm figuring this out by trial and error, rather than a detailed reading of the online manual, so it was not complicated)
I've later notice some static while indoors, but that was in a building known to have mesh in the walls and poor cell phone reception
Even just moving over one foot was enough to improve quality.The Clip+ is smaller than I expected


A little larger than a cell phone battery and smaller than most automobile control fobs
I wish it had a lanyard loop so I could hang it around my neck
I don't think it matters where you clip it, you will probably not notice it


Yes, it's light-weight and made of plastic
It may not deal well with being dropped, so I'm inclined to keep it in a pocket or only clip it where I think it is secure
On the other-hand, it's so lightweight, the earphone chord would probably stop it falling

Speaking of earbuds, the ones that come with this are okay, but you probably want your own, unless you have none.

$REVIEW.: I have had this receiver for nearly two years now, and love the way it operates, for the most part.  It outputs clean, loud sound, and the various settings for surround sound are easily switched between and create the desired effects.  I have it set up as a 7.1 channel surround sound, with one 12&#34; powered sub-woofer (it is possible to set up with two).  The only complaint I have is that it doesn't come with WiFi built in, and the $100 adapter is a piece of junk, that has never worked except when hooked up to my laptop, and there is no way to set up the WiFi directly through the receiver.  If WiFi were built in, and the set up worked, this would be a 5 star receiver.

$review_text.: This is a fairly specialized item, so if you're reading this review, I'll assume you know what a drive mounting bracket is for. Sabrent makes at least two models and I've tried them both. The BK-HDDH (the other model) is lightweight, but well built. The BK-HDDF (this model) is a bit heftier and seems equally well built.These mounting brackets allow you to fit two 2.5-inch HDD or SSD in a single 3.5-inch drive bay. This is nice because SSD drives tend to be smaller in terms of storage capacity, and with limited drive bays, it's nice to use them efficiently if you're aiming for lots of storage space.Both models come with all the necessary screws and such. It's fairly straightforward. Again, if you're reading this review, you probably know this is for you. All I can say, really, is that I tried both models, they worked just fine, and I'm entirely pleased with them.Full disclosure: I received this product from the manufacturer to review; however, I did not allow this to influence my review.

There is a very slight lag between the time you squeeze the brake lever and the brake light coming on the bike an the brake light coming on the helmet. That's ok though because I think it garnishes more attention that way.  It is very visible.  EXCELLENT purchase.  Install was pretty simple.  on the VN750 Vulcan the Black/yello wire was ground and the blue wire is the brake light.  I hooked the transmitter just BEFORE the snap connector to the brake light under the seat.

$review_text.: My Macbook Pro was constantly crashing on me, giving me the grey screen saying that "Your computer restarted because of a problem." It seems that I had a bad stick of RAM after running the Apple Hardware Test, so I decided to upgrade from the installed 4 GB to 8GB. The difference isn't drastic, but it is noticeable. Considering this MacBook Pro (late 2008 Unibody) originally was supposed to be maxed out at only 4GB, later software updates allowed it to take the 8 GB that I installed, which was very easy to do. I imagine when doing photo or video editing the extra memory will pay off - for the price I couldn't resist the upgrade. So far I haven't had any Kernel Panics, and my Mac hasn't crashed. I hope it doesn't. If it does, I will edit the review at a later time.

$REVIEW.: If you've ever walked around with a camera around your neck for any period of time, you've probably been annoyed by the constant banging of the camera against your chest.  Maybe that's just me.  The point is, there could be a better place to have the camera rest when it's not in use.This strap provides that better placement.  The motion of pulling the camera from the hip just feels natural and the position is much more suitable for walking around.You could spend $50+ on a more expensive quick-strap method, but I've found that this strap suits my needs perfectly.

So these help extend the length of time I can shoot photo or video considerably since I can swap these out while charging back up my 2 Nikon Batteries. I still will end up buying spare Nikon Batteries but this was a great money and time saver since they were half the price, but they do only provide half the power...If they start to have low performance I will update, or if I can do a test to demonstrate how man shots I can get out of both of them I will and post that information as well.

$review_text.: I have always heard my friends talk up the Harmony remotes. After recently moving all my AV equipment into a hall cabinet, I required a RF remote. I figured the Harmony 890 was the answer. Initial computer setup was decently simple. I was able to find all my equipment in their database. I had all the IR repeaters in place and remote running in under an hour easily. While it does seem to be doing the job, I'm not thrilled with it. First, the buttons have a real cheap feel to them. I have heard people complain that since the buttons are not raised, they're hard to find without looking. Well, that doesn't really bother me.... but each press feels like I'm pressing something out of a McDonalds happy meal. I'm not exaggerating. Second, there is some additional delay from the time you press the button until the action is executed when using RF (nearly all the time). I have tested this side by side with the equipment's IR remote, and then Harmony. It's there. And when scrolling through DVRed shows or the onscreen TV guide, the delay gets extremely annoying. Third, the display is not nearly as nice as pictured on here. The colors are not nearly that bold and clear. And that picture is flat out misleading. Honestly, that kind of upsets me. Because there is no way in hell Harmony was able to photograph their remote with that quality picture on the remote display. It's straight up Photoshop. On that same note, the buttons do not glow that bright and perfect as pictured.But as mentioned, it IS working. A lot/all of my equipment features seem to be accessible from the remote. Honestly, if I had the purchase to do over again, I would probably research a little more and attempt to find another product. There maybe no other remotes as complete as the Harmony..... but maybe there is. And it surely would be cheaper...EDIT: Ok. I have used this remote for over 2 years now. I had some mixed reviews after a couple weeks of use, but now I have felt compelled to expand on my review. Put simply, it's a piece of you know what. The silver paint on the remote is flaking off, the remote wakes up without touching it (runs down battery) and doesn't wake up when touched, it occasionally gets confused/locks up and the battery must be pulled, a tab on the battery door broke and door doesn't stay perfectly in place, the factory battery swelled up and had to be replaced, the remote is slow to react to button presses (bugged me from day one)....but the biggest problem I'm having lately... the remote does not charge while in the charging cradle. I'm POSITIVE the gold contacts are making connection. The dock LEDs are illuminated, so I know it's getting power. I have resorted to removing the battery from the remote and using a wall charger (similar to a digital camera).All in all, I'm unhappy and will not be purchasing another harmony remote. Ever.EDIT: So it has been just shy of 3 years now. The remote is still working... but barely. The volume rocker button doesn't work anymore. I reprogrammed the channel rocker button to serve as the volume adjustment, since I use the cable guide/arrows to change the channel. A couple of the other frequently used buttons are starting to fail as well. The "exit" and one of the side screen buttons I use for "list". Surprisingly, the very most used buttons, arrows and ok still work 90+% of the time. Other than dodgy buttons, my biggest complaint lately is that the button lag has gotten to be brutal. Sometimes it takes 5+ seconds for a button press to be executed. Sometimes it will never execute the button press, until you press a different button. Then it seems to "push through" the first command and execute both button presses at the same time.It's still doing the job. But barely. I spent so much money on this remote, I'm trying to ride it out as long as I can.EDIT 3/21/12: So it's been almost exactly 3 years since my purchase and the remote has officially gotten to the point I'm going to replace it. The infrared output from the remote has stopped working. The RF portion which controls the IR blaster works fine, but the actual IR from the remote doesn't work anymore. For most people, this means you can still control all your devices hidden in the closet, but you cannot control the TV right in front of you. No power on/off and no volume control. I called Harmony support to see if they would repair it at my cost (If it's cheaper than buying another RF remote). They said that they do not repair the Harmony remotes. Problem remotes under warranty just get replaced. Once out of the warranty, there's nothing they can do for you. Well..... that sucks.

$REVIEW.: The Pandigital Photo Mail Frame comes with an easy setup guide, which is a page long, and a proper instruction booklet, which is longer. The basic features were quick and painless, while the more advanced options, while complicated, weren't too difficult for me to figure out.The interface is pretty convenient. The unit has, at the top back of the frame, a menu, enter, and exit buttons, as well as left and right arrows. These are repeated (with an up, down, and other buttons) on the included remote control. The remote while cheap looking is fairly responsive.This digital frame allows a variety of external devices to transfer photos, music, and videos including USB and SD card. This entire transfer process is quite user friendly. It can also support wifi through the USB. The Photo Mail contains many of the standard features of digital photo frames such as sideshows, background music, clock and calendar, etc.However, this photo frame's most unique feature is its email option. Basically, you can receive photos to download to the frame's internal memory. This process is pretty fluid. Each unit is given an email address and 60 download credits (which allows the transaction). It has its own built in wi-fi adapter and automatically connects to a cellular network (no hassle).I really enjoyed the crisp quality of the pictures and the ability to receive photos by email. This feature would be useful for people who receive more photos than they take themselves (e.g. long distance grandparents). The ease of instant use was a big plus, even if the setup of other items was more complicated.The unit has a few downsides too. Unless it's hung from the wall, it's not terribly sturdy. Mine fell over a couple of times while I was trying it out, which can't be good for it. Also, a person using the photo mail feature frequently will incur additional charges after 60 uses, annoying given its high initial price tag. Finally, the email feature is outdated, given Facebook and other technologies to photo share.Overall, this is a decent product. I'm an avid photographer and love how it makes my DSLR photos look crisp and natural. I didn't mind the setup and don't find the other features too much of a hassle. It meets my needs, but then again, I don't use it a lot or use a lot of the features.Update:I've revised my review based on longer usage. Also, I'm not a ghostwriter for Pandigital. I actually don't find the product that bad, although I don't really have a lot of experience with digital picture frames.

$REVIEW.: I replaced my old Samsung with this Lenovo, and I love everything about it. I'm running window 8 pro, and it works great. I won't go all technical because I'd imagine someone already did; but the simple things like having volume controls above the keyboard. Not to mention the mute button for those YouTube vids with bad sound etc... it's got 5 rubber stands on the bottom so your computers isn't scraping along the surface. The exhaust fan is much better than Samsung it's not continually running nor getting really hot. The keyboard keys are way better looking, and feeling. The mouse pad, or what ever, has a rubber grip texture instead of a smooth plastic feel which is way better for scrolling the courser. The buttons at the top of the keyboard have a soft light so it's easy to see in the dark. The power cord is much lighter than my Samsung. In fact the whole unit is lighter than my old laptop, and the screen is thinner than my Samsung. The speakers are small and on the left and right sides of the laptop, and the bass boost is a great improvement over my old. The gun metal is great it has a nice silver tint in the light. I don't know if it's because it's new, but the performance is way better, and it's not loaded with junk you have to remove. So I'd say it's the best PC I've owned.
$SUMMARY.: What an upgrade.

$REVIEW.: The review below was written soon after purchase. Updates a few months later are below.The quality of the picture on this TV is absolutely amazing. It was simple to hook up and set up right out of the box. It accessed our home wi-fi network very easily and the quality of pictures streamed from Netflix was beautiful. No issues with connectivity at all.The menu is simple and intuitive to use. Initial set up (where you input your IP address, home address, Netflix information etc) can be a bit annyoing since the remote does not have letter keys but once done there is really no need to have to deal with that again. The only apps I have tried out so far are Netflix and Pandora. The sound quality when playing music is more than adequate for my needs.While it does not have the 120 Hz that supposedly helps while watching sports we have not noticed any issues with it being 'only' 60 Hz.Initially, when connected to our old AV equipment, the picture displayed on the tv was quite poor. However, that had more to do with the VCR/DVD and cable quality than with the tv. With the older dvd player we couldn't get the picture to be quite 'right' and the automatic backlight adjustment needed to be turned off. Once we switched to a blu ray player that upscaled our dvd's the picture was absolutey amazing. So, if you are using older equipment you may not see the full potential of what this tv can do.Also, since the TV is Wi-Fi capable we bough a blu ray that was a bit cheaper since it lacked wi fi but was excellent at upscaling dvd's.Samsung BD-E5300 Blu-ray Disc Player (Black)The tv has 3 HDMI inputs, one component input and one usb input. Our kids have their Wii hooked up using the component input and a regular 3 prong AV cable and, while nowhere near an HD picture, it works. The Wii does not have the HDMI option so the picture quality is a bit disappointing for wii games. The newer version of the Wii should function just fine.Warranty signup was easily done online and I did speak to the Vizio customer service (based in the US) to double check a few things and everthing went very well.We have only had this tv for less than a week but, so far, we are extremely pleased with it.Update Sept 2012: Still a terrific TV. Start up is a bit annoying especially if you use it only to stream Netflix or Amazon since it takes a good 2-3 minutes just to get the app started. Otherwise, everything has been excellent and we are still very pleased with the purchase.Update Jan 2013 : Stuck on vizio logo on startup. Chatted with vizio and they will have a tech contact me in 5 working days to schedule a repair. From what I am seeing online the main board seems to be an issue with this brand. I am very disappointed that this would happen with a six month old tv. I will post updates once service is completed. At this point I would not recommend buying a smart tv or a Vizio. Better to go with a blu ray that has the apps and a tv that just does one job  - being a tv.Update March 2013 : Took Vizio about three weeks to get a contractor out to fix the tv. He had to replace the entire mother board. Frankly, had they shipped to me with instructions I could have done it myself but it was under warranty so I suppose they had to do it. Three weeks felt like a very long time considering that you can get a part shipped cross country within a day in today's world. The tv is still lovely with a nice picture and sound but it is slowing down again on start up. If it dies again I will update this review. Otherwise, it is still alive and kicking!Update May 2013 : The saga continues! Still a beautiful picture but last week we started having issues with the remote control. Everything would start up fine for a few minutes and then only the power button on the remote would work. Contacted vizio about this via chat and, after doing some resetting of the remote and tv with no improvement, they sent out a new remote. The remote arrived in less than a week but did not fix the problem. While talking to vizio and trying to reset things, the back panel buttons on the tv conked out and then we got the lovely black screen of death for a few minutes. Vizio is, without any arguments but some expression of frustration on my part, going to send out a recertified (but NOT refurbished) identical tv. The rep emphasized that refurbished tv had repairs done whereas a recertified tv was just out of box or a customer return that they ahd to test and recertify as having nothing wrong with it.Should be here in two weeks and hopefully should work like a charm. I am pleased with vizio for customer service. Got a live American agent in less than one minute every time and they were very prompt and proactive in figuring out the problem. Not so pleased with the product itself but hopefully this particular tv was just a lemon!Update July2013. The recertified set was delivered very quickly and the delivery guys set it up perfectly. Unfortunately, it came with quirks of it's own. This one starts up fine but the volume controls, and sometimes the input selection, will not respond for the first five minutes. Wait it out and it work perfectly after that. Picture and sound, like the first set, are lovely. So, this was NOT an ideal purchase but with the 5 years of extended warranty I got with this thing, I'll be sticking with it for a while.I fully expect more issues with this thing within a year but don't think any more updates are necessary - this is not a TV I would recommend to anyone.
$SUMMARY.: Excellent quality and price for a smart TV - BUT see updates

$review_text.: So I decided it was time to get a digital SLR camera.  I've always wanted to get into photography, but the cost of developing film with our old film SLR and the non-artistic feel of our point-and-shoot digital cameras, has kept me from pursuing it.  With some persistent prodding I convinced my wife that it was something I really wanted, so we splurged for it.  I decided to get an entry level D-SLR; the Nikon D3100 with the 18-55mm kit lens for $550 on Amazon.  The real deal was the Auto-focus 70-300mm Nikkor VR lens for $200 off when you buy any Nikon D-SLR, so it made for a good deal.  The Vibration Reduction is really amazing.  The feel of the D3100 is great for a beginner, but I can already see why it is in the "entry level" category.  There are these little quirks, you know.  Like, in the "auto with no flash" mode (which is actually really great most of the time) sometimes the camera glitches and washes out the image with extreme over-exposure.  This is only in low-light situations.  In general the camera is pretty inconsistent in low-light settings.  The auto-focus is especially finicky here, making AF near impossible, though this is most prominent with the zoom lens and may be an issue with the lens.  In the "Live mode" the AF is absolutely useless unless you are in full daylight.  Maybe this is an issue with the settings, but it seems pretty limited in the setting category.  But, all that said, I absolutely love this camera and it is perfect for me to experiment with and to learn the art of photography.  I am already ordering a fixed zoom in the AF-S 35mm f/1.8G as I read these are great for low light shots and would help with photos in the studio.

$review_text.: This is a great little case for a dell mini 9. It is made of "leather look" vinyl and has relatively thick foam padding inside both the main compartment and the smaller compartment. The case holds the mini well, but there are a few things worth mentioning:1. The case smells a bit when you first open it up. It has a chemical smell that goes away with time. Not a big deal.2. The straps that hold the mini in place are elastic on the bottom and clear plastic at the top. Time will tell how well they wear. I suspect that the elastic bottom bands will get loose over time.3. There is a small cushion in the back of the case that puts the notebook at a good angle for typing. If you prefer to type with your notebook flat, you cannot remove the cushion without cutting it out with a knife.4. The zippers are heavy gauge, and made of steel. They will likely outlive the vinyl exterior of the case!All-in-all I am very pleased with this case. It keeps my mini secure. One reviewer said it looks like a purse when being carried. I think it looks more like a book case for a Bible. If you're a guy like me, don't worry; you will not be mistaken for a purse carrier!

While trying to see what I could be doing wrong, I pulled up the pictures on Amazon to see if maybe I was trying incorrectly or something, then I find the pictures and the item that I received were 2 different models.  What I got was not what was pictured.  I probably would have kept it and used it though if it had fit together like it was supposed to.  It had good ratings, and it seemed like a solid product but just didn't fit together.  Thankfully Amazon makes it easy to return items.

$review_text.: I paid about $14.00 for this case and for what I paid, this product is worth it!- The case has the typical synthetic smell- The case is not that well padded (but then I wasn't looking nor interested in anything bulky)- The elastic that holds the keyboard in place should be bigger. On occasion when I open the case, the elastic slips off- The top part of the case has a flap that tucks in. The flap has Velcro that keeps in in place- The cuts for the buttons, webcam etc etc are nicely done- Has an elastic holder for stylus, pen- Case has slots for SD Card size (the description say microSD); but if you have a keyboard, the keyboard covers the SD slots and you'll need to remove the keyboard to access it. The slots are too tight for SD Card. Using it for microSD card, it feels loose. I wouldn't trust it and don't recommend using it- Installing the device into the case is a two step process; first the tablet is installed, and then you slide the keyboard into the case and wrap the elastic on the keyboard- You can use the case without the keyboard attached on the inside- Has elastic strap to wrap around to keep the case closed- Has flap on outside so it can be a stand (without the keyboard)- You cannot charge the tablet only with the case closed. But if you have a keyboard attached to the tablet, you can connect the charger to the keyboard charger port to charge both items.So why the 4 stars? Because the tablet frame is made way too cheap. It feels like cheap box cardboard and the bottom corners are very thin. Nonetheless it's a good value for $14.00, but I wouldn't pay $20.00 for this.

$REVIEW.: I have worn hearing aids for almost three years and have tried various brands of batteries.  The Energizer batteries are the best by far.  Hearing aid batteries can be a nuisance due to their short life but, these Energizer batteries have lived up to the claim on the packaging, as these batteries have performed longer for me than other brands that I have tried.  It makes for excellent sound.  I am highly pleased with this battery.I also like the way this product is packaged and the ease of dispensing the batteries from the package is very convenient.  The packaging makes it easy to use one little battery at a time, less chance of dropping one.  The tabs make battery insertion a breeze.  The batteries have been reliable and consistent.  I would recommend the Energizer hearing aid batteries over any other brand any day!!

$REVIEW.: The concept behind this iConnect is wonderful -- ports for up to four USB storage devices and wireless and web access to everything on them.  It can be attached to a USB printer to make it wireless within the home network.  If you leave home without an important file, you can access it and download remotely. It comes with Trend Micro Internet Security, Iomega QuickProtect, EMC Retrospect Express, and MozyHome Online.  This was something I knew I would love -- that is, if it actually worked.Unfortunately, the iConnect I received was malfunctioning.  It didn't work on my Mac or on my husband's Windows PC.My Mac did not recognize it no matter where I connected it -- a network hub, my router, directly to my computer, all kinds of connections recommended in the quick start guide.  I tried different patch cables, including the one that comes with the iConnect.  I connected different USB hard drives in case one of them was the problem. I went through all troubleshooting guides both on the CD and online without getting past the first stage, so I decided to turn to Iomega support to help.  What a disaster.  First, I discovered online that Iomega will charge customers $25 per call for tech support, even for items still under warranty.  Right there, that's offensive.  Because I couldn't find a solution to my problem in the FAQ area, I decided to try the one-to-one chat which resulted, not surprisingly, in my going over everything I did and in the rep deciding that he could not help me via chat.  He approved me for a free phone call because the problem was clearly beyond his capabilities.  (The support area required me to type in the serial number so many times that I had it memorized; every page in the step required me to reenter it.)  If I had been allowed to go right to phone tech support, I would have saved an hour of my time.After spending an hour with me on the phone, going through a series of troubleshooting steps, the next representative concluded that my unit was defective.  Well, okay, it happens.  It wouldn't be the first time that I received a defective electronic device.  But it went rapidly downhill from there.  First, he told me that I had to pay the shipping to Iomega, and next that I would be sent a reconditioned product in return.  At that point, he did not know that I was part of Amazon Vine; for all he (and Iomega) knew, I was a paying customer who had bought a new but defective device but who was going to get a reconditioned product in return AND would have to pay for part of the shipping.  That is not acceptable.  Imagine if you spent your money to get a new iConnect and could only get a factory reconditioned unit.  (Note:  if this happens to you, return to Amazon.  They have a better policy than the manufacturer.)Next, I pulled the Vine card -- that is, I told the rep that I had received this for review and that this experience was going into my review -- something I shouldn't have had to do. The representative agreed to transfer me to a supervisor, who never got on the line and instead told the rep that I needed to provide proof of purchase.  The supervisor would then review the invoice to see if they would ship a new device.  I sent a pdf of my Vine invoice.  Have I heard back from the supervisor?  No.  I should add that the rep who assisted me on the phone was patient and calm; it's Iomega's policies and supervisors that I find fault with.Here's the thing:  if a customer buys a product, she should expect a manufacturer's quality control to ensure that she will get a fully functioning device.  In the event that this does not happen and the device is defective, she should be entitled to easy and free technical support, customer service, and, if that fails, a brand new device.  If they treated a reviewer, someone they knew would post this information online, this way, imagine how poorly they might treat someone wouldn't necessarily use this outlet.The iConnect is a small, lightweight, black box that doesn't call attention to itself.  It comes with a short patch cable and an installation CD. It also has built-in iTunes and media server, although, since the device doesn't have its own memory, I can't guess how this may work.It's really too bad that the iConnect isn't manufactured with better quality control and that Iomega doesn't stand behind it.  This goes down as a great concept on paper but poor in execution.UPDATE:  After filling out a survey about my dissatisfaction, I was finally contacted by an Iomega supervisor, and he offered to send me a new iConnect, with the shipping on them.  I will update the review after I receive and test the new unit.UPDATE 2:  The "new" unit was really a refurbished one and somewhat battered.  And guess what?  My Mac doesn't recognize this one, either.  That means that the tech support failed to recognize a system problem (and how to correct it) AND it took my brand new iConnect and gave me a used one.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann

$REVIEW.: I've been building a number of systems lately, and needed to put together a few of my own too.  So in addition to building several servers based on newer Xeon chips, I also have had the pleasure of building two core 2 quad systems recently.Intel's entire lineup of new chips have some real positives.  TheIntel Core 2 Quad Q9450 Quad-Core Processor, 2.66 GHz, 12M L2 Cache, 1333MHz FSB, LGA775is a great chip in particular that offers you some of the benefits of a server CPU at a home PC price point.  It's also very compatible with the types of boards and set-ups that most gamers or heavy application users (read Photoshop :) ) will want in their rigs.Like theXeon Quad-core - X3350, the 9450 also gives you the 12 MB of L2 Cache, which is the largest easily available through retail channels and 50% larger than the 6600. True, for $200 you can get theIntel Core 2 Quad Q6600here on Amazon.  It has a very similar clock speed (easily over-clocked) and a respectable 8 MB of L2 cache, which is nothing to sneeze at.  Like I said, I used that guy in my personal box, but I did find that it was possible to locate the 9450 at a similar price.  So while Amazon's price does vary, if you do your research you can get the larger cache and slightly faster clock speed of the 9450 for the same price as the 6600.People building a home server that is pulling multiple duties or running multi-threading apps likeAdobe Photoshop CS3will benefit from the extra cores.  Not to mention, if you have gotten away from 32 bit OS and moved to 64 bit (Either Vista x64, Linux, Solaris, Suse, or another one) you will definitely be able to squeeze some extra juice out of the extra hardware.Unlike the Xeon, this guy isn't compatible with the 3200 board architecture that gives you ECC DDR2 800 ram and some other extras.  So while that makes the Xeon better for server specific applications, the 9450 is definitely comparable in performance for all other functions.The LGA775 architecture is somewhat standard for Intel's core-2 quads.  You get support for a 1333 FSB.  Once again, with a 64 bit OS you get to take advantage of much more RAM too.If you are a home user or are building a workstation, it may make sense to go down to theIntel Core 2 Quad Q6600.  But if you have a system running processor intensive functions, the extra cache of the 9450 can come in handy.  Similarly, if you do your homework you can get it for about what the 6600 will set you back.Check it out and do your research before you decide.Enjoy.

$review_text.: Hoya has some good polarizers for the 52mm and this is one of them.  Its not MRC which can be a problem.  Had several scratches on this lens but, really can't see in on my photos, only the dust particles appears on photos.  Comes in handy when taking pictures during the day and capturing reflections on lakes, and some beaches (if the water is clean) helps you to see reefs and what not.  I notice it doesn't come in handy when shooting through a glass window where you're capturing a picture of a person or thing through the window as it cuts down on your reflection (depending on the light source too).I bought this a couple times and my first one, the ring broke off and was bummed out.  I never had this happen to my b+w.

$review_text.: I bought this just before Christmas.  I was very happy with it until about a week ago when the screen when blank.  It won't boot any more.  The power light comes on.  The status light come on.  The caps lock flashes and that's it.  The screen stays dark.  At first I considered this abnormal behavior, but after visiting the Lenovo support pages I'm quite shocked at how many people have this happen at the 3 month mark.  This computer is not reliable.  Send it back NOW!  Support on the Lenovo web site is virtually non-existent.  Ishan, in particular, has no helpful advice.

$REVIEW.: Originally, I was using a Skinomi.  That's the wet application kind, and I usually prefer those.  Once they are on, the screen is super protected from scratches, and they are so clear you cannot even tell they are on.  But the glare was killing me, because I like to set this up on my desk at work to watch news and videos, and the flourescent lights and window lights caused terrible glare.  So I ordered a cheap matte protector for the Transformer off of Amazon.  It was for an iPad.  Amazon quickly refunded.  Ordered another cheapie; it wasn't even matte.  Amazon quickly refunded.  This one was just right.  Easy to apply, definitely cuts the glare and the fingerprints, and I like the way it feels.  Yes, the screen is slightly less clear, but it's a trade off.  Also, when you look at the tablet, you obviously notice there's a protector on it, unlike the crystal clear ones, but there is no way I can have crystal clear with no glare.  So I chose no glare, and this matte protector is just right.  It's a good deal.

$review_text.: First I bought the Canon Selphy CP-800 printer so my wife could print 4 x 6's from her MacBook. Failure #1. Contrary to any other printer I've ever tried, this printer cannot connect to my wireless print server (an Apple Time Machine) via its USB port. So, no wireless printing, and I called Canon to ask for a solution. No problem, says Canon, buy our BU-30 Bluetooth Adapter for another $50 and you'll be all set. Failure #2. Any of my 3 Mac laptops can easily connect to the BT adapter quickly. But, it's not a print server in any sense of the word. It's just to push a file to the printer, so one can't print directly, either from iPhoto or Canon's own Selphy Printer software, because the printer isn't really hooked up to the computer. This means you need to make a note of the file name and its folder, and search for it by that name (not by sight) and use your Bluetooth software utility to push the file to the printer. Try that with a few thousand files, or even just a few dozen, to search through. Failure #3. There's a limit to the file size you can transfer using the BU-30, and it's apparently a ridiculously tiny size. My wife's Canon P&S; cam generates JPG files usually between 3 and 4 MB, hardly very large by current standards. After a 2+ minute attempt to transfer the file, the transfer ultimately fails, with the printer giving a message of "file too large". Another call to Canon, and I'm told the BU-30 is really just made for file transfer from camera phones, so just for laughs I tried a picture from my iPhone 4, still too large. What a joke. Failure #4 for Canon's poor customer service and description of this product.1-star because the printer does work OK when hardwired to the MacBook, but the prints are quite dark.  The printer also requires a lot of space around it; ~7" in front for the paper tray, then another 6" or so in the back, as the paper slides back and forth a few times during the print, in and out the front and back of the printer.  Add to that the size of the printer itself, and you're talking about ~18 inches of depth, for a "compact" printer???  The cables also attach to the left side, rather than the rear, so that's another few wasted inches, and the power brick is ridiculously large.  Does anyone at Canon ever try these products?  Sometimes I wish everything could be designed by Apple, and ergonomically, this printer is one of the most poorly-designed computer products I've seen.  Don't let the product picture fool you.I'm sending this back to Amazon, and buying the HP Photosmart D110a instead.  It takes up about the same space, even though it's a full-sized printer, can print any size up to 8 x 10", and has real wireless capabilities (802.11g/g/n) built-in.  4 x 6" print cost is about the same, and the HP is only ~$70 (total cost of the Canon, with the BT adapter, was $110).

It's really pretty, colors are vibrant and good quality, but when I tried it on my laptop (HP Pavilion m6-1045dx) it's a little bit loose all around


I would love it if it's an inch smaller all around and thicker material

Most items sold here on Amazon (cases,decals,bags) aren't up to date yet with the slim laptops that have come out recently


I'm saying this coz if I had a regular sized, bulky 15inch laptop it would definitely have fit with the machine's thickness

But the past couple of months, ultrabooks and slim (lightweight) laptops are about an inch or two thinner than their predecessors, so it wouldn't fit the nice cases they have on here
I'm holding on to this for the next few days and will upload some pics, but I'm not sure if I'll keep it

$REVIEW.: I own the G-11 and the Firefly Borealis.  The G-11 was huge, but I like the custom keys on the left side.  The G-11 was not very bright in a dark room (IMO).  I also have the Firefly keyboard on another PC, it is thin and low (no clips in the back to adjust the height) and the typing is smooth like a laptop.  The Firefly has only 1 color (blue) but it is very bright (much brighter than the G-11) and the lights have an auto shutoff feature after 5 mins. of no activity.I love the Saitek Eclipse II because the colors are definitely brighter than the G-11, the brightness is adjustable, the sides light up, and the Eclipse II has 3 colors to chose from vs. 1 color (blue) for the G-11 and Firefly.  I love how the Eclpise II has 2 height adjustments!  If it had the auto shutoff feature it would be perfect but still deserves 5 stars!

$REVIEW.: I must have received a bad batch of these. The placement went on great, and I used YouTube to figure out where to put them. Once I put the adhesive strips on I could not get the backing off. I tried an exacto knife, razor blade, my finger nail, and a screw driver. Nothing worked. I just kept tearing the adhesive and only getting paper instead of a sticky side. I tried this with every piece and failed. I wish they would put easy pull tabs to each piece to make this easier. Anyway, I ended up leaving the paper and adding super glue to Mae everything stick. I sure hope that I never need to replace the glass again. I would recommend buying dabble-sided sticky tape and making your own strips over buying these.

$review_text.: I as with many was looking for and aftermarket remote for my EOS 7D and 1D

As usual Canon aftermarket products are cost prohibitive


I really like to stay with the parent manufactured aftermarket products but Canon prices are normally too high and 3rd party equivalents work extremely well in most cases

Canon by lowering their prices on their aftermarket products would sell a lot more aftermarket accessories and be able to maintain their market base after the sale


The Canon purists will always stay true to Canon but Canon would increase their base by lowering their accessory prices
I always check for Canon first, go into cardiac arrest after seeing the price and start looking for third parties.I was pleasantly surprised with the product when received

It has easy to use instructions and is a no brainer in its application


The range is more than acceptable and beats the inferred units where you have to be in line of site

It allows me to work more with my subject and not keep me behind the camera


It is great for composition setup as you can see your shot from many angles

Also people normally are not relaxed when the photographer in behind the camera and they are surprised when the flash goes off when I'm not there.The hot shoe mount is not the best but I did not plan to mount it there as I use a flash 90% of the time so a simple Velcro dot placed on the camera body and the receiver works well.I would recommend highly.

$review_text.: I would probably rate it at 4 stars for the limitations that I noticed, but for less than $40 with the box, grid, and carry case, pffff... it deserves 5 stars! The limitations should have been obvious, but I didn't really think them through.Most other reviewers do a good job of explaining the product, so I don't feel compelled to go into a great amount of detail. I'll just say that it seems well made and durable enough (considering it's a lightweight umbrella, essentially). I like that it includes reseallable bags for the grid and the translucent panel and a carry case for the whole kit, though I wish the bags were of a more durable variety. Still, though, it's good enough.I wish I had thought about how exactly I would position this, because some of the things I was imagining are just not possible on a straight light stand. For some reason I had imagined that I could orient it sideways or angle it if I wanted to, though that's just silly now that I think about it. It just sits straight up on a light stand and faces straight forward. It's big enough that it is still useful, but the rectangular shape produces a certain effect and I had hoped to be able to vary the orientation to change that up. Had I thought it through, I would probably have gotten an equally large square or octagonal softbox instead.You can acheive all of the things I had hoped to achieve if you mount it on a boom arm. I wanted to get a boom arm, anyway, at some point, but I didn't think I would need one right away (and even then would have preferred to use if for hairlights or something). So, I think I'll get a couple of boom arms at some point and then be completely satisfied.Despite all that, its a big ol' softbox that gave me great results right out of the bag. I've never used a grid before and I was impressed how much it helped control spill and allow fine feathering. I don't mind so much (right now) that the flash is buried inside of it because I'm pretty capable at getting the power &#34;in the ballpark&#34; and then only having to do one or two adjustments to get it just right. It's better to have a larger softbox so that you can place it further away from your subject while maintaining a large apparent light source. This way you won't have to adjust the power as much if your subject moves around a bit because their relative distance to the light won't vary as much compared to if it was closer to them.Here's a tip, while you're dialing in your power only attach the white panel at one or two spots so that it's easy to still access the flash inside. Only attach it firmly when you're satisfied with your power levels.

They're also not very versatile, as there's no reasonable way to attach something to the handles of the clamp for rigging up DIY mounting solutions (as you can with more sturdy clamps with a mounting hole in the handle).I had originally given a second star because they might be useful for some low-stress purposes, but by a year later, 4 out of 6 have lost the orange part. So I'm going to stress again: these are _really_ cheap, and I think you'll be better off buying something that costs several times more but won't end up in trash.
$SUMMARY.: Really, really cheap.

$review_text.: So i decided to replace my old battery in my older lap top and went with this one, i did what the directions asked for charge and discharge to break it in so far its done pretty good but sometimes i do get a blinking light for battery charge , i simply take the battery out and put it back in and it goes away a small issue but still worth what i paid for it. I can go for hours with just the battery 2 hours 20 mins area . So i shot a product review on this so you can see it up close and in HD  search rumrunner439 or 1159 videos on youtube or go here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsZyUh8mJKsid gave it a 5 star if it wasnt for the blinking light i get every once in a while but for 22 bucks who's complainingCody of 1159 Videos

$review_text.: I'm a noob to videograpghy. I just wanted an inexpensive camcorder since I wouldn't need it much. The Flip is tiny, and can fit in your pocket. It's so simple to use, you don't need a manual. There's 3 buttons and a toggle type pad. Press the red button and you're recording, it's that easy. There's a play and a delete button. The toggle switch allows you to zoom in and out and go forward and backward thru your videos. The Flip cuts out all the bells and whistles to keep the price low. THere's no remote, no light, no strap, nothing. All you can do is zoom in and out X3 but that's digital zoom not optical. The lcd screen is tiny as well, but effective enough. Fine, but how well does it perform? I took some video at a car dealer. There was lots of big windows letting in lots of light. I then transitioned outside to a mostly cloudy sky. The video is surprisingly good. There is some block noise, and graininess, but not that bad. Then I went indoors under incandescent light. Here I was disappointed. The video noise increased severely even in a well lit room. The subject was decently clear, but the background had massive video noise. The Flip does have a mic, but it's internal, and on the front. Anything not within 10 feet or so and facing towards the Flip isn't going to be heard well. The Flip is designed for easy Youtube upload. I had never done this before, yet even I had no trouble. Plug in the Flip to a usb port. Load the software to your computer(it comes up automatically) and then upload video. Very simple. Be aware tho that you'll need a seriously fast upload speed on your internet service. It took 4!hours to upload a 10 minute video! You also lose alot in the upload in video quality. Good videos become decent, and decent videos look like they were filmed with a $120 camcorder. A Flip makes a good child's present. It's handy for taking unexpected videos as well. Of course, most digital cameras have a movie mode, but that works for about 15 minutes, and there's no mic. The Flip runs for an hour and has sound. Still, why bother filming anything if it doesn't look great? If you want to record a throwaway scene that you'll dump on Youtube, the Flip's great, but for archiving things you want to watch again, look elsewhere as I'll be doing.

$review_text.: $[...] for a portable radio?Worth every penny. This little gem is a great addition - whether it just gets moved around the house, garage or garden, or finds a permanent home in a biookshelf or kitchen counter.The sound from this radio is quite stunning given its size. The on/off and volume switches are a little fiddly, but you soon get used to them.We live in something of a valley, radio reception has never been great. This thing though, picks out radio stations we never thought we'd be able to tune in to.I even connected the earphone socket into my 'audio in' on the family stereo... you know, just to see if it would work. Great idea! Despite a single speaker on the unit itself, the headphone output is in stereo.On a full charge, this will keep you going for an entire day, no problem at all.The surface of the unit has an almost rubberized texture - most definitely not got the feel of 'black plastic'. I've picked this thing up with wet/damp hands, near frozen hands and gloves - with not so much as a slip.The input/output DC in ports each have rubber plugs to keep unwanted dirt or moisture from the openings.

$REVIEW.: If you wanted a handle for your GoPro this is prefect.  If you want to go in the water with your GoPro this is perfect.  When i am on a boat shooting while moving, i at least know that if i drop it, it will not sink.  When i am diving, if i drop it at least i will only have to look on the surface for it.  I have lost a GoPro diving before, this is worth it just to protect from losing it.  It is also good for just walking around and recording.

Only issue is that since it can be folded up for portability, at times it can feel a bit frail when putting over the head (though it may not actually be frail); the folding and twisting parts sort of move around when putting over the head, just be careful not to break it.

$REVIEW.: Read the other 1 and 2 star reviews.  Believe them.  Looks like they make about 75% good units and 25% duds.It would not work separated by 30 feet, through 2 rooms and 2 walls.  It would not work separated by 8 feet, through 1 ceiling.  It did, however, manage to connect when the transmitter and receiver were 5 feet apart in the same room.  I could use the HDMI cable to make that connection and would not need this kit.I am fairly electronics competent, but there is not much you can do to make this thing work.  I wasted about 6 hours.  There are some things you need to figure out on your own, like you must have a TV plugged in to the feedthrough output on the transmitter or it will just keep flashing all the lights.Reluctantly I'm sending it back.  I really needed what they say it will do.BenPS: To commend Amazon, they credited my account within an hour after turning the return over to UPS.

They said lubricating the keys would not solve the problem.  They told me to send it back to them.  I did and they sent me a new one.  I have not tried the new one yet, but if they have solved the key sticking problem, I will like it a lot.  I love the big illuminated letters, my old eyes need them.

$review_text.: For $25 on ear headphones they are good for the price. The mids and highs are a little muddy and the bass is booming, but it does not echo. You can feel the bass, but just not all of it. I bought these for the gym and I didn't like it. It slid off my head when I laid down on the bench press. They are comfortable, you can wear them for hours, but your ears will feel hot after a hour or so. The headphones feel sturdy and are lightweight. Great for on the go. Thick wires that don't get tangled up, and not to mention it looks great. I ended up returning these headphones because I wasn't satisfied with it for the price.

$REVIEW.: I haven't had any problems getting this to work with my equipment. I've used it with the following:- Onkyo TX-NR616- Comcast &#34;X1&#34; receiver- Flirc USB device- Panasonic DVD playerThere's no delay as far as I can tell. And this kit will allow you to control up to 8 different devices at once -- each extender contains 2 sensors. And the cords are quite long. Much longer than I would ever need. But they're also very thin wires so they're easy to bundle up and get out of the way. They don't take up a ton of space or anything.My only &#34;con&#34; would be that I wish the main received was a little smaller. It's not large by any means, but smaller is always better. Also, the distribution lock has an LED that blinks when it's receiving a signal. This is great for troubleshooting if there's a signal issue. But depending on where you place this, you may need to cover it up with tape or something if it's going to be visible in a dark room.

from a design standpoint the maker should have made it so the device powered off when ever the usb module was stored in its compartment rather then force the use of a slide switch..


if that was the case I would be removing the adapter and putting it in the mouse for travel rather than leaving it in the laptop

$review_text.: They're all made &#34;over there&#34; so who's to say that the Anker for $10 more is a better choice.  So I'm taking the Amazon leap of faith and trusting in the star rating.  I bought this because I had a Western Digital My Book as my second of four back up schemes and it died this week.  Since I had a spare drive and I kind of wanted to test the drive inside the WDMB, we bought the Anker.  So we opened the My Book and discovered the Green drive was dated 2007, not bad service for running 24x7 most of these six years.  Popped that drive into the Anker and away we went, working just as before.  In fact my backup scheme (not using WD software, but GoodSync) recognized it as before and backed up as normal.  I'm very pleased all around.  I think I will run the Anker and the old drive 24x7 and see how long it goes.  I'll try to report back.  Cheers, Al

$REVIEW.: I bought this phone and finally cut my land line for good. It's ONE great phone. The sound is clear and I love being able to change all the settings to my own personal needs, wants and desires..... so many apps to choose from and such a good price. I don't need a phone to do anything more than bring me incoming calls and allow me to call out, but if I want to check email and Facebook, I can.Although this is being called a *BASIC* phone it does WAY more than I need it to do and it's been a blast trying to figure it all out. Since this is my first SMARTPHONE, I've been taking my time learning all the varied attributes, most of them I'll never use but it's nice to have them available. The most important feature for me is that I can hear people clearly without static or disturbance through the connection. The second is that I can BLOCK all those telemarketing calls which drive me nuts, my land line wouldn't allow me to do this unless I paid for that service. The third is that I love the NOSTALGIA ring tone as it sounds like a phone from days gone by. My dogs seem to enjoy this ring tone the best too.....Don't hesitate to buy this phone....it's really such a good bargain and it's worth it weight in gold. I LOVE IT !

$review_text.: Update 23-Jun-2014: After 150 days of waiting, I've given up. I found a better, cheaper solution. Intel has no interest in fixing the reported and verified issues. After installing latest BIOS and drivers, I still can't yank out the HDMI cable and use the unit headless. What's up with that? How hard is it to fix that? All the other issues, such as inability to boot with certain USB devices remain unfixed. Intel has ceased to provide status updates on any of these issues on their community discussion website. They've left complaining owners holding the bag. They've moved on. So now I have too.I found a better solution. YMMV. Be sure to check it out. I bought a Gigabyte Brix GB-BXBT-2807.Gigabyte Intel Celeron N2807 Mini PC Barebones GB-BXBT-2807. Its everything I wanted and expected from this NUC and even more, even cheaper. The Brix has much lower power consumption, no fan, dead silent, flawlessly serves up Blu-Ray ISOs from the DAS, runs Windows 7, 8.1, Ubuntu 14.04, Mint 17, OpenELEC. It happily works headless and boots with all my USB devices attached. While it's not a Core i3 in speed, it is sufficiently performant for most tasks. It makes a really great 24x365 Windows/Linux/HTPC/OpenElec server. Absolutely check it out.Update 28-Mar-2014: 90 days later -- Still no fixes. Just blah-blah. How is it possible that Intel can't fix major BIOS and driver issues? This is a great example of why open source is the safest choice.Update 8-Mar-2014: Rumblings of a revolt on Intel Community forum. Months later no fixes. Here's my statement to Intel about why they should be a good citizen and fixes their BIOS and drivers. "I can't make a compelling case for how my living room HTPC impacts sales. I can state that my Amazon review, currently pinned as a top helpful review, is going to become increasingly more negative due to the total lack of fixes for the headless HDMI and USB boot issues. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, INTEL PLEASE FIX THESE ISSUES. I EXPECT A COMPUTER TO BOOT WITH USB DEVICES ATTACHED. I EXPECT I CAN PULL THE HDMI CABLE OUT AND USE THE NUC HEADLESS. I'M TOTALLY STUCK AND NOT FEELING THE LOVE. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE FIX YOUR ISSUES.Update 27-Feb-2014: 60 days later -- Still no fixes. At least Intel is being more active in discussing the fail on boot issue on their NUC forums.Update 27-Jan-2014: 30 days later -- No fixes for any of the four reported bugs. However, Intel has now confirmed all four issues. Lowered rating to two stars. Intel, where's the updates?Update 28-Dec-2013: Others are confirming the inability to boot when USB 3 devices are attached. Likely this is an issue with all D34010WYK NUCs, maybe even all Haswell NUC variations. If you are thinking of buying this NUC and attaching USB 3.0 devices, you'd better read this thread: communities.intel.com/message/213356#213356Update 24-Dec-2013: BIOS setup GUI freezes upon selecting some specific options (yes, before even saving changes) such as "Boot immediately upon power-on". Other options freeze too.Update 24-Dec-2013: New hassle. NUC fails in BIOS bootstrap when more than 1 USB 3.0 device is plugged in. When more than one USB 3.0 device is plugged in, the startup screen has a missing "F2 to enter setup ..." message. Solution is to plug in just one USB device, power off/on, immediately after BIOS stage hands off to Windows, you can plug in all devices without issue. I'm guessing that early BIOS stage doesn't enable, or can't draw, full USB 3.0 current but does so immediately upon handing off to Windows. The issue occurs using a powered USB 3.0 hub with all USB 3.0 devices also powered. It also occurs without the hub. Can anyone else confirm this issue? I'm guessing this is just an issue with the BIOS firmware which can be corrected with a BIOS update.Several major disappointments. My usage is as an always-on device mainly for HTPC use (file service, transcoding, etc). First disappointment is the noticeable fan noise -- a bit of a grinding or whirring sound. It's just loud enough to be noticeable and hard to mask. Second disappointment, perhaps temporary, is due to a graphics driver bug, you are blocked from running it as a headless Windows PC. It needs to have an active monitor plugged in at all times - it needs the monitor's EDID. If you either try to boot without a monitor, or you boot but later yank out the HDMI cable, the remoting software (LogMeIn, SplashTop, etc) freezes with a black screen and dead mouse. This was not the behavior on the Ivy Bridge versions of NUC, only the Haswell. I'm using Windows 8.1 Pro N with the latest BIOS and drivers.

$REVIEW.: I did not want to spend a lot of money for a basic CPL filter and Amazon offered this at a reasonable price.  I ordered with additional product to qualify for the free shipping.  I would not have ordered this by itself and paid more for it including the shipping.  It is a thick CPL, not the slim-line more expensive ones and does negatively affect my shots when using my zoom lens with a UV filter, because you can see disortion at the widest view (18mm).  The polarizing affect, while visible, is minimal in my opinion to others I have used in the past.  You are really getting what you pay for when you purchase an inexpensive item. The ring seems tight but so far is ok for my needs.

$review_text.: I have been an LX5 owner for 2 years
In this time I have also used Canon S90 and S100, and Nikon DSLRs.First off, I think it's funny how the features that camera companies market as being the big selling points for their products differ to the reality of what is actually great or mediocre about them

With all the buzz-words Panasonic and others throw around with each release, it becomes a challenge to parce out what's really new or meaningful for this model compared to previous ones, and its competitors
That said, here are for me the main selling points of the LX7:What I like:- The lens


Unbeatable f/1.4-2.3 max aperture range, with 24mm wideangle! That is a full stop brighter across the zoom range compared to the LX5, and unmatched by any other compact zoom camera.- Noticeably improved autofocus speed compared to LX5 (even after the LX5 firmware upgrade)- Noticeably improved shot-to-shot lag time, as well as shutter-button-press-to-capture lag time- Nice, 920k-dot LCD screen- The multi-aspect sensor


Introduced in 2008 with the LX3, this continues to be one of the great (and under-appreciated) features of the LX series
Enables 24mm wideangle at every aspect ratio (except 1:1, which would likely make the sensor prohibitively expensive).- The electronic level is surprisingly useful, and should save me a lot of time in post-production just straightening the images


I leave it turned on pretty much all the time.- The ND (neutral density) filter is a welcome addition, especially given the diminished minimum aperture range.- Another oldie but goodie: Panasonic's Intelligent ISO
Automatically adjusts capture settings based on camera shake and focal length; very useful! I get more usable shots from my Panasonic LX-series cameras than I do with my Canon S-series cameras because of this feature.- The macro is very good on LX cameras, with extremely close focusing distances when zoomed out.- Marketing gimmicks: 3D (kinda fun, actually, if you can convert the files), time-lapse, HDR, panorama, high-speed video, 1080p video with stereo audio, aspect bracketing, multi-exposure night mode, some good burst modes for JPEG shooters, and some other nice features I'm not likely to ever use.What I don't like:- It's noteceably bigger and heavier than the LX5.- Relatively slow zoom in/out (same as LX5)


Trade-off is that there is no mechanical noise during zoom in video recording (as in Canon S-series)

Might prefer a mechanical zoom similar to Fujifilm's X10 and XF1.- No one likes the lens cap
Still


I bought one of those auto-folding ones from Amazon at the same time, so at least those sellers & manufactures will continue to see healthy sales

It's nice, but makes the camera seem even larger (and more difficult to fit in a pouch/pocket/etc.- I also hate the shoulder strap Panasonic seems to love to much, and echo others who have suggested including some kind of wrist or hand strap instead

I end up folding the shoulder strap and taping it into a neat handle that straddles the top of the camera; this is infinitely more useful for me (and safer to boot).- The dedicated aperture ring

I appreciate the attempt at adding additional external controls, but I would have preferred dedicated EC, ISO, or shutter speed to aperture

On compact cameras, there is little reason to shoot in aperture-priority mode, as the depth-of-field is going to be deep in just about any setting, so this is really just a big waste of a feature that could have been really useful

Of course, a multi-function ring would have been the obvious choice


Perhaps Panasonic wanted to save this up for the LX9?- To accommodate the aperture ring, the aspect ratio and focus dials on the LX7's lens barrel are smaller and closer to the camera body compared to the LX5

They are also harder to adjust, and are oriented in reverse to the LX5..

not an issue in and of itself, but a minor annoyance from those upgrading from an older LX model.- Likewise, the mode dial takes more effort to turn compared to LX5


I imagine this change was implemented thanks to feedback from previous models saying that the mode dial was too easily bumped accidentally while the camera was not in use


Fine
That happened to me a couple times


But I miss not being able to easily change it with my thumb; now I need a thumb and forefinger to adjust the dial while I hold the camera with my other hand
And in fairness, the dial now protrudes slightly more.- Panasonic effectively replaced the LX5's Focus button with a White Balance button, which is fine, but they also removed white balance from the quick menu, which I find annoying.- Cannot delete image after capture in image review..


seriously? I consider this a bug


Would also be nice to scroll between images in image review mode.- Still relatively slow buffer--not for shot-to-shot, but shot-to-playback.- Poor color rendition (Adobe RAW defaults, compared to larger-sensor cameras)- Menu is more attractive than predecessors, but still tricky to navigate, and cannot be navigated quickly


There is also no in-camera help.- Image quality not the greatest; effectively unchanged from predecessors

Panasonic actually uses a smaller sensor in the LX7, presumably in order to accommodate the bright lens

A fair trade.- Slightly shorter battery life compared to LX5

Granted, the LX5's battery life is pretty solid (for a compact), and on the LX7 I think it's still solidly above average


My guess is it's the drain from the hi-res screen

Another fair trade


One nice thing, however, is that the LX7 and LX5 use the same batteries
I wouldn't mind, however, a much larger battery, as there's room for the hand grip to extend thanks to the protruding lens.- No GPS

I like having this option on my S100, but it does take a toll on battery and camera size.- Panasonic's mystifying folder hierarchy and file naming conventions


Would be nice to be able to browse a cleaner card, and customize file-naming convention (but one that makes more sense would be a good start).Don't let that long list of cons scare you; it's always easier to come up with things that aren't perfect than things that genuinely please you

It's just a heads-up for things that may or may not bother you, as well as a hint to Panasonic for things they should work on for the LX9.Before I bought the LX7 I was also considering Fujifilm's X10 (or its future successor), the more compact XF1, or nothing at all

I really love what Fujifilm is doing with their stylish, retro designs and innovative controls built around very capable compacts that supposedly product stunning JPEGs but lousy RAW images (due to their maverick sensor designs)
Check 'em out

In all honesty, I might not have upgraded if it weren't for a momentary, massive price drop on the LX7 (others have mentioned that Amazon's price for this camera tends to fluctuate)

But now that I've got it, I'm pleased with the progress Panasonic has made, and sold my LX5


It's a pleasure to use compared to the S100, which I might sell also, except that its size lends itself better to sticking into a small bag for "just in case" occasions.At the end of the day, the Panasonic LX7's shining star is its bight lens


Add to that a nice screen and faster operation across the board, along with everything the LX series already had going for it, this camera's a real winner.

$REVIEW.: We like this model because it still has the upgradable ram (not soldered onto motherboard), and the battery and hard drive are not glued in (replaceable by the user). It also has the optical drive which we use sometimes. It is a little heavier and thicker than the newest models, but still very portable. The graphics are capable of driving HD displays at 1920x1080 (1080p), with a small graphics adapter to HDMI.

All the lights work, but it doesn't route anymore and it doesn't let you make phone calls anymore.7)  Small glitches with its routing ability.  The more configuration you do, the slower the routing becomes.  Very underpowered processor doing the routing.So yes, Vonage is inexpensive phone service.... but when you have to buy a new router every 1-2 years it isn't as cheap as you initially think!!

$REVIEW.: The Olloclip is a great accessory. I love the fisheye look and this lens is just what you want for wide and super-wide shooting. Since it clips over the iPhone's camera, you can shoot video or stills and use whatever camera app you like. The lens is of very good quality, and shots look great without any further tweaking. For tight spaces or capturing a big field of view, this cannot be beat.The lens can also be flipped to the other wide angle lens. If you unscrew the wide angle lens you reveal the macro lens. The macro lens lets you get VERY close to things, like closer than a finger-width. Clarity from all lenses is excellent and turns your iphone into a very great camera that would put a lot of point and shoots to shame.For a cool effect, try using the fisheye with the iPhone's panorama feature.The one tradeoff is that the Olloclip covers up the flash, so there is a slight compromise. For me, that's fine since I rarely use the flash and the built in flash would not be adequate to cover the expanded area required when using a fisheye lens.

$REVIEW.: I also own a Kodak M1020 frame which I'll use for comparison.  Both frames are very good and it really depends on features and appearance of the frame that appeals to you.  I got the Kodak M1020 dirt cheap so I would call it the better value, but the Sony has a faster processor and slightly better picture quality.The Sony uses 9 watts of power versus 6 watts for the larger Kodak - neither one will break the bank to operate, but the Sony will cost 50% more to run. The faster processor on the Sony comes at a cost, but I would say it is about 50% faster than the Kodak when displaying a grid of pics, selecting pics, accessing menu options, etc., so you get what you pay for.I love the remote control on the Sony, although you have to be fairly close to the frame for it to work. The Kodak lacks a remote but can be controlled via touch sensitive invisible buttons on the front of the panel, which is really cool, but I'd really prefer using a remote control. You can, of course, control the Sony from the panel but the buttons for it are behind the frame. I'd say the Sony is more intuitive to use than the Kodak.The Kodak frame can play back videos (as long as they don't exceed the resolution of the frame), includes a speaker, and can play mp3's - none of which can be said of the Sony. The Sony has a somewhat nifty calendar feature that'll display the date/time when the picture was taken along with the picture, or it can display the current date (via a calendar) and time along with an ever changing picture, and it also has an option to display three pictures at once.Both the Kodak and Sony have several nice transition options when moving between pictures, but my favorite transition is the "pan & zoom", which can only be found on the Kodak.It is much easier to transfer images to the Sony's internal memory (via an inserted memory card) than on the Kodak, which must be connected to a computer via USB.  Note that you don't have to use the internal memory on either frame - both will default to the memory card if one is inserted. The Sony reduces the file sizes of images when transferring them allowing for many more pics to be stored internally.  You'll have to do the resizing yourself for the Kodak.  Both frames were able to read my 8gb SDHC cards as well as 4gb and 2gb SD cards.Overall, I prefer the higher tech look and features of the Sony, but the Kodak is a formidable, worthy competitor, and I'm not ashamed of either.  I give the Kodak 3.75 stars and the Sony 4.25 stars.  I'd give the Sony 5 stars if it could do video and audio and you can bet the next generation of Sony picture frames will have those features.

$REVIEW.: Wow New Trent! Great work! I really like the updated keyboard and case you have produced for the iPad Air

This device represents a substantial improvement over an already high quality device for the iPad 2/3/4 generation

This is an easy five star rating!What's great about the new case?*Solid Construction - The new Airbender has a metal foot and hinge that really makes the unit solid and holds the iPad Air securely in the correct position.*The sleek redesign provides a great key layout that provides a seamless transition from a full-size keyboard layout.*Rugged construction provides essential protection for your iPad Air when not in use

The clamshell design stays closed, protecting the screen while in transit (unlike other brands I own).*The quick access keys for functions like changing volume and brightness make this a must-have for any iPad Air user.*LED lights have been reduced in size and brightness to allow easy viewing of the CAPS, Charge, and BlueTooth connection without the distracting brightness of other bluetooth keyboards.*A protective covering prevents the case attachment from damaging the back surface of the iPad Air (never did before anyway, but nice to have that extra protection.*The screen stand is removable so you can move the screen away from the keyboard for easier viewing and typing or to reduce the sound of typing in the background of audio recordings while you type notes.* The adjustable foot allows a wide variety of viewing angles, meaning I can find a clear viewing angle without lights reflecting on my screen, regardless of the room I'm in and its lighting.I used the New Trent keyboard tirelessly in my classes, and the Airbender for iPad Air has made my transition to the new iPad easy! New Trent keyboards and styluses are essential tools that make allow me to make the iPad my primary computing device.

$review_text.: Even though I'm using them in a home (I have two of these), it's really worth buying professional switches.  CISCO stuff works, the documentation is complete, and the ability to manage the switch, reset the POE state, monitor power, etc is invaluable when working with security cameras.I can't agree with the comment that it is misrepresented, I think it's clear that not all of the ports are POE.  I'm sure that was to control cost, and limit power dissipation.Works perfectly.  This higher price seems like a bargain after you use it.

$review_text.: This lens is fantastic if it works well with your body
It's a nightmare otherwise.I tested this lens closely with my 5D and 7D


With 5D, it works perfectly as if nothing happened, and it is wonderful
But with 7D, the focusing error is H-U-G-E


It's well beyond what I could compensate with the body setting
When I manually focused, the image was good, but I didn't pay money to do that

(I'd get TS-E 24mm II if that was the objective!)The focusing error with 7D is very consistent
The actual focusing distance is always considerably nearer than the target at the AF sensor being chosen

I doubted something might've gone wrong in the recent firmware update, so I factory reseted the camera, flashed again, immediately followed by another reset of the camera, etc


No luck

It's not my operator error

I've been doing photography for 16 years, with most of my time shooting medium format cameras
Although I'm not a Navy SEAL or anything, but I can manual focus when I'm exhausted, sleep deprived and drunk at the same time


But this EF24mm f/1.4L II can't autofocus on fresh firmware, new battery, clean EF mount contacts, and all I could give


Again, it worked fine with 5D, but I just didn't want to get stuck with a lens that only works with some bodies and not others, so I had to return it.Now the problem is, I don't have any other lens I want to replace it with

Sigma 30mm f/1.4? No way.

$review_text.: This UPS is a beast.  It was shipped via freight truck (not regular UPS/FedEx courier), which took a little longer than usual Amazon Prime speed--but I still received it in 3 business days from ordering.  The UPS is shipped on a small pallet and shipping weight is a solid 125 lbs; the UPS without the pallet and packaging is 112 lbs, so plan accordingly.  I estimate that with the batteries removed, the unit weighs about 55 lbs (I took the batteries out to move it up a few flights of stairs).You should also beware that this UPS ships with a 20 amp plug with a horizontal spade (a NEMA 5-20P)--you cannot plug this UPS into a regular outlet (which is a NEMA 5-15R).  If you have a regular 15 amp circuit, look at the 1500 VA version of this UPS (which is also a lot smaller and only weighs 58 lbs).  [Update:  The APC documentation, if I understand it correctly, indicates it is "safe" to use an adapter to plug into a 15-amp socket.  If you want to do this, check the documentation and see if you believe this to be true.]My biggest concern about buying this UPS was noise.  The specs say 45 db at 1 meter, which didn't seem too loud, but I had read a lot of complaints about the smaller version of this unit being very noisy.  I am very happy to report my unit is darn near silent.  If I put my ear up to the unit I can hear the fan (which is always running), but otherwise, I can't hear it from my desk.I am using this with a beefy Mac Pro system that draws about 900 watts.  I wanted a sine wave system and I wanted to migrate from a bunch of small UPSes to a single one to reduce clutter and simplify things behind my desk.  Connecting the USB cable from the UPS to the Mac enables a bunch of UPS preferences on the Mac without installing the APC software.With a 900 watt draw, I get about a 15 minute run time from this unit.  This is a little less than I would like, but it's still quite reasonable given that this power unit doesn't involve diesel.The unit is also as attractive as a big black box of batteries can be and the front display is readable at a distance.  There's some buttons on the front for navigating menus and a setting for configuring the quality of power you have, which implies the UPS has some heuristics.  My power is pretty good, so I didn't investigate this further.Anyway, all in all I am happy with this unit.  It's expensive, but far cheaper than the gear plugged into it!Update Feb 2012:  One of my monitors used to squeal from its power supply when it was warming up.  I noticed a few months ago that I hadn't heard the squeal since I bought this UPS.  No squeal is worth the price of this UPS, if you really hate squealing.  :-)  I still love this UPS.  No regrets.

$REVIEW.: This is a great device.  Battery life is exceptional.  I like the idea of the high-rate position feedback, but can't use it with my android.  The data rate is too fast, and the android bogs down.  This receiver made it possible to use my 4.3&#34; tablet without a GPS as a full-featured GPS when I got an app that did that.  I've tried one other BT GPS, and don't have particular complaints about it, but this one looks nicer, and maybe that's why I use it more than the BTC.  I read that you have to watch out what level of BT serial emulation is supported when you buy BT GPS devices.  When I was doing my research, Qstarz customer support was very helpful.  They were able to clarify whether the device supported augmented precision reception modes or not - it does.  Bottom line, if I knew someone that needed a BT GPS receiver, I'd recommend this one over the other one that I tried.

Thank goodness I didn't waste my money. Several months ago my old roommate had bought a Bose system and thought they were great. Great volume but after going to my buddies house with his set up i discovered there was more to just volume but depth and feel of audio. Now this set up that i made isnt the top of the line or anything but works very well for my set up and size of room i am dealing with.Soon as I unboxed them they look great. Way larger than I had thought they would be but still dont over power the space.Took about a week for them to break in and start to produce some great sounds. Had a house party the week after and had the whole house shaking with the rest of my BIC set up.Bottom line, I love them and am happy shelling out the close to $600 I payed for them. :)

THE SOUND CABLE THEY SEND SUCKS BIGTIME, static, crackle when moved. buy MEDIABRIDGE cable (mine is eight ft, their max length). the mediabridge is awesome, has solid metal ends with plastic tip covers. no static with these. THESE SPEAKERS GET BETTER AS I LISTEN TO THEM. STILL GRINNING. you will, i repeat, YOU WILL BE BLOWN AWAY by the logitech z623s (in a smaller room, not for whole house, but i can hear them well in any room).UPDATE 3 DAYS AFTER PURCHASE:BURNT SMELL FROM AMP OR POWER SUPPLY. STILL PLAYS ON RCA BUT NOT 3.5mm. THANKS LOGITECH. WANTED TO GET THE WIRELESS KLIPCH, BUT ONLY ONE INPUT SORT OF LIMITED ME SO I REPURCHASED THESE, AND WHEN THEY GET HERE, ILL RETURN THESE. WANTED TO GET THE CORSAIR SP2500, BUT ENCLOSED WOOFER WITH JUST TUNED PORT LIMITS FREQUENCY.  IF I BLOW THESE AGAIN, I MAY TRY THE CORSAIR. THE CORSAIRS HAVING ACTIVE (TUNABLE) CROSSOVERS FOR MORE ACCURATE SOUND (according to them), ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE TO PICK CONNECTED ROMOTE CONTROL UP TO TURN UP/DOWN, WHEREAS ON Z623s, JUST REACH OVER AND ADJUST VOL. KNOB. so i went with the wireless klipsch, with one aux input (for tv). also these are only 50 watts continuous play and peak at 200. that is probably what logitech is, they omitted that. thanks logitech.  also these are not for someone who puts laptop in lap, the speaker cord keeps pulling out of laptop.  that is what blew the speaker input i believe. that is why i must get the wireless.UPDATE 2nd pair.  sent the klipsch back, got these again. AFTER GETTING THE KLIPSCH PROMEDIA 2.1 WIRELESS, THEY SUCKED. GET THE LOGITECH Z623s IF YOU WANT THUMPING BASS AND GREAT MIDS.  KLIPSCH ONLY HAS HIGHS AND BASS DISTORTS AND WILL NOT THUMP, PERIOD. I CANT BELIEVE THEY ARE RATED SO HIGHLY, I GUESS BECAUSE THEY ONLY HAVE HIGHS. LOL. the z623s have better volume and sub volume knob and much, MUCH better sound, but i have to have wireless as i put my laptop in my lap daily, the cord keeps pulling out and giving feedback, thus blowing the input on my z623s.  im glad they didnt fry my audio out on my laptop. THE HIGHS FROM THE KLIPSCH HURT MY EARS EVEN AT LOW VOLUME and still no bass without distorting. go with the z623s, you will be happier.  if i didnt need wireless, i would have kept them after exhange. I GOT  THE LOGITECH BLUETOOTH ADAPTER $40.  AWSOME SOUND, IF IT DROPS, IT JUST STARTS BACK AND NO DISTORTION AT ALL. you dont have to press button on bluetooth each time, but you do, on my computer, have to initilize the bluetooth connection each time.  I AM NOW ALWAYS READY TO GET HOME AS SOON AS I CAN SO I CAN HEAR MY SPEAKERS AGAIN.UPDATE NOV 26,2012.  I reordered the z623s after klipsch let me down.  I AM SMILING AGAIN.  this time i got the bluetooth adapter from logitech.  wow. perfect sound.  can turn volume and bass to max. thumping.  sound might not be quite as loud with bluetooth adapter, i haven't pluged it in with a cord yet, yet cannot hear any difference. plenty loud with bluetooth. no distortion like klipsch, bass is perfect, need about 5 or 10 more watts to satelites, still rocks. i also bought a three year warranty for 19.99, a steal, from squaredeal.  also a 2 yr warranty for bluetooth for $4.  i am so happy now. klipsch are being sent off tommorrow. the usb transmitter kept rebooting after 3 seconds of playing, thank god. GET THE Z623s, YOU WILL LOVE THEM.UPDATE: still rockin, it thumps to dance, hip hop, rock, metal, movies, etc. no burnt smell this time, just smiles on my face as i grin from ear to ear. youve never heard bass like this from any speaker system, maybe at a club or from really big speakers.
$SUMMARY.: klipsch promedia 2.1 wireless sucks, GET THE Z623s

$REVIEW.: I am so glad that I gave this little machine a try; it makes life easier, doing what it does so well!I chose it for use on my upper lip and the sides of my face. The Emjoi Epi Slim removes all of the fine downy hair, leaving my skin oh so baby smooth. Note that I didn't have to deal with the pain factor that 'newbies' tend to experience as I previously tweezed (tedious) and then graduated to epilating with one of those hand held springs (worked well except for certain angles) for a couple of years prior.Light pressure with the Epi Slim in a circular motion and going over the area until I cannot feel any more 'pulling' lets me know that I have gotten it all and can move on. Note that this is not an electric razor, but rather an epilator, so having to go over an area numerous times is just par for the course. I do have a few coarse post-menapausal hairs that don't seem to get caught up and have to be hand tweezed, but as it's just a few, it only takes a few secs to take care, so no problem.I read so many reviews about using it on the under arm area but not having ever done anything but shave, I was very reluctant to venture there, to say the least. However, I finally gave it a go and whoa! I will never go back to shaving my under arms again! It did not hurt like I had feared it would and, again, I am left with baby soft skin.I like the Emjoi Epi Slim's small manageable size and while I can imagine wanting something larger for a larger area such as the legs, this is perfect for where I use it. I really like the small price I paid for this little dynamo, and am so glad I gave it a go!

$review_text.: **5/16 Update**Well, I finally gave up and returned it.  In theory this is a good idea but the execution is just off.  I forced myself to accept the screen quality but the performance was the eventual deal breaker.  I didn't buy this to be a laptop replacement, but I don't even enjoy using it for the light tasks that I did buy it for.  Web browsing is a headache. It is so frustrating to only have about 1/4 of all attempted Flash video run, and run barely passable at that.  As for HD Flash video, forget it.  Despite additional RAM, installing Flash 10.1, and the reassurance of several online videos showing this thing running 720p You Tube trailers, mine just choked anytime I attempted to play any HD Flash content.  Sound and video sync was off and the video would just stall.  I thought I could at least use this for Hulu and other television show sites but they just don't render anywhere near acceptable for me.  Same for Flash games.  They too lag to the point of unbearable distraction.  I've used older PC's with even less impressive specs than the T91 and even they play Flash web games just fine.  Any Flash content (other than ads and banners) spikes the CPU to nearly 100%.  So, with Flash out, I figured I'd maybe use the T91 on the go with my digital camera.  Well, that too proved futile.  When managing pictures, photos sometimes take up to five seconds to load (at reduced resolution).  When I tried to review several photos from my camera's SD card, it took so long for each photo to load, I finally gave up and used the camera's LCD instead.  Microsoft includes a nice photo app in their touch package but even that ran slow and was more frustrating than fun to use. Performance on battery was all but useless unless I set it to super performance mode.  This has obvious consequences on battery life and I found myself getting 2-3 hrs battery life at the most.  If I allow it to manage performance and set itself to battery or auto mode, performance turns terrible.  So I have a 9-inch tiny netbook that gets worse battery life than the average full-sized notebook with standard battery and performs pretty weak, even in super mode. I finally looked at it this morning and came to the realization that I have no use for it because I can't really do the things I want to do.  I can't watch my television shows online, can't watch news footage, can't play games online (Bejeweled 2 was so choppy, it seemed like stop motion), can't manage my photos on the go instead of relying on my camera's LCD or lugging around a full-size laptop.  The only thing I can really do is light web browsing.  Well, I can use my Droid as a quickie web substitute, so that left no real use for the T91.  My expectations are not unreasonable.  It's not like I installed Mass Effect 2 and tried to run it with all settings at max.  A netbook should play You Tube at least as well as my smart phone and definitely not worse.  I'll probably buy the 1201N as a replacement. I still need a netbook with bluetooth.  I'm optimistic that the ION based 1201N will give me much better results with the things I want to do.  I really want a touch screen and a SSD, but until they can create a convertible with better performance, I'll simply settle for usability.  I briefly looked at the Lenovo S10-3T but I'm avoiding it because I don't even want to remotely risk going through this again.  I'll stick with the 1201N.**Original Review**I bought the T91MT because I wanted a small and simple touch screen device to use for light browsing and email while on the go.  I preferred a touch screen for times when I want true portability without the need for a desk or mouse.  Due to the many missing features (no printing, no Flash support, no USB support, etc) an iPad was out of the question.  After thoroughly researching the alternatives, I decided on the T91MT.First, the pros:  The T91MT is extremely attractive and compact.  It has a smaller screen than most netbooks, but that adds to the portability.  Despite the tiny screen, I don't find myself side-scrolling as much as I anticipated.  The keys, despite their tiny size, are fine for me with typing.  Granted, it's more hunt and peck than traditional typing, but it still beats screen-only typing.  The mouse pad is sufficiently responsive but I don't like the single mouse button.  I actually scooped up a bluetooth mouse for my T91.  It only has two USB ports and I'm not about to sacrifice one for a wireless mouse, nano or otherwise.  I have no problems when switching or alternating between touchscreen and mouse(pad).  The SSD drive is totally silent.  In fact, the netbook is so quiet, I suffered from phantom noise syndrome. I'm so conditioned to hearing some type of noise from a computer that I started imagining hearing hard drive clicking sounds. Needless to say, it was just that, my imagination. This is the perfect netbook for students or anyone who doesn't want disruptive sounds during use.  The netbook is fairly easy to navigate and controls are easy to find. The swivel screen feels sturdy and inspires confidence that it will be durable enough to withstand a few years of steady use.  Asus doesn't disappoint in the extras department either.  I was tempted to purchase a case at the same time I bought the T91.  I searched for one but had a hard time finding one specifically for the T91, preferably made by Asus.  Well, I'm glad I didn't find one because Asus already provides one with the T91, and a pretty nice one at that.  In fact, it's even better quality than the Lenovo made netbook pouch that I bought for my daughter's Lenovo netbook. A DVD containing Windows 7 Home Premium and all pre-installed software and drivers is also included.  The T91 comes with a 1GB RAM module installed in the bottom compartment.  RAM can be upgraded to a maximum of 2GB via a single chip in the same compartment.  I would have preferred extra DIMM slots so the RAM could be upgraded by adding an additional 1GB DIMM instead of simply tossing a perfectly good 1GB stick aside in favor of a 2GB single stick.  I knew this was my only option before I purchased the T91, so I this is not so much a complaint as maybe a little hint if any Asus reps read this feedback.When I fired up the T91, my first complaint didn't take long to form.  The thing was S-L-O-W, even by netbook standards.  I realize the first boot is painfully long, but even afterward, just plodding through routine tasks was sluggish.  My first pangs of buyer's remorse after using this for a little while were regrets that I didn't choose the peppier Asus 1201N instead. I realize the T91 is not intended to be a mobile workstation or gamer laptop like an Alienware or XPS, but it was even visibly slower when compared side-by-side to my daughter's 18-month-old Lenovo S10.  The bottleneck was partly due to some of the usual causes; a ton of pre-installed bloatware and Windows 7 was running with all the eye candy enabled by default.  After uninstalling several unwanted applications and lowering the visuals to basic, i gained a slight increase in performance.  I don't need the aero glass effects on my netbook if it's going to slow my system to a crawl.  Another factor in the slowness is the pokey SSD.  Although Windows rated it at 5.9 (which is actually pretty good), I've seen some slow write performance.  Particularly, when downloading software, I noticed it usually takes longer to write the cached downloaded files to disk than to actually download the files. The SSD was part of my preference, which, along with the touch screen and smaller size, were the reasons why I opted for the T91MT over the 1201N.  Performance can get downright frustrating at times, particularly with Flash heavy websites.  The touch screen on the T91 is very dim (even at highest brightness) and grainy.  I researched beforehand and realized it was a resistive touch screen and I was fine with that.  I've used similar touch screens in the past on HP and Motion tablets, so I'm familiar with their look and feel.  The T91's screen is much dimmer than I expected.  Combined with poor contrast, this makes text difficult to read at times.  The touchscreen material further gives the screen a certain graininess.  I realize the T91 screen is small and all, but come on, my Droid is even smaller and the Droid screen is much brighter.  If you're looking for something to rival an iPad screen or similar capacitive touchscreen, this is definitely not your cup of tea.  You will be hugely disappointed.  The screen supports multi-touch and gestures (the touchpad supports gestures as well).  You can write on-screen with the included stylus.  This is one of the benefits of having a resistive screen, particularly for professionals and students.  Screen responsiveness is okay but it gets a little dodgy around the edges at times.  The stylus also requires a little force to prevent missed strokes.  Sound on thwe T91 is ho-hum, but I have not yet found a netbook that has good speakers.  They all sound like transistor radios to me and this is no different.  Battery life is okay.  I get a few days of mixed light and moderate usage from a single charge.  I use it for an hour or less at a time, so I have not tried an all day test yet.  The one thing I did not know prior to purchase is that the battery is sealed in the unit and is not user replaceable.  I really wish I knew this before purchasing.  That would have been a deal breaker for me.  Being as though it is highly unusual for a netbook/notebook to have a sealed non-removable battery and none of the reviews/product info that I read mentioned this, I was VERY surprised to discover this upon receipt.  I subsequently went back and read every Amazon review and noticed one or two Amazon reviewers did mention it, but they weren't in the group of reviews I originally read. So, I have no one to blame but myself for not reading the reviews thoroughly enough.  As far as tablet use, the T91 never feels awkward nor becomes noticeably warm during use.I really want (and trying hard) to like my T91. But I must honestly say, I'm only toughing it out because of the restocking fee.  Otherwise, I likely would have returned it already (and still might).  It's sometimes difficult to read text on-screen, performance is lacking at times,  touchscreen is so-so, and my concerns about the embedded battery persist.  I realize netbooks aren't perfect and shouldn't be expected to perform as well as laptops.  However, for nearly $500 (which is pretty much regular laptop money) I expected at least a little more value for my dollar than a dim unattractive screen and sub-par performance.  I'll likely keep it and I plan to perform a fresh reinstall of WIn 7 minus the bloatware.  I also plan to max out the RAM and insert a 16 or 32 MB SDHC card.  If these last ditch attempts work, I'll gladly update the review and rating.  As it stands now, I can barely offer three stars (I dropped as low as two but that's a bit harsh.  I realized it's not quite that bad).

$review_text.: This is my first MP3, but I love it!!!  I confess I have purchased at least 4 different MP3 players for my husband in the past year, and not one lasted 3 months under 6-9hours use/week.  I finally got a "real" Ipod for my husband- so far so good.I recently purchased a Coby digital photo frame, and I am delighted with that device.  When I saw a Coby MP3 player, I had to try it for myself.  I don't know about the earphones that come with the player, I have a pair of Bose earbuds I use, but the sound from this device is great!  Easy to load files with nearly any Windows program- Rhapsody, MediaPlayer, RealPlayer.We'll be taking an extended airline trip soon, and I can't wait to use this player to block out the flight noise.

$REVIEW.: Pros:Integration with iTunes (Mac), Design and Build Quality, Belt Holster, Battery PerformanceCons:poor radio reception, no audible.com support, no Apple Music Store (AAC) supportDetails:I have the Rio s50 (same product as the s35s, just different plastics and rechargable AA instead of the AAA)I borrowed an iPod for month and fell in love with it but couldn't justify the expense, didn't like the scratch-sensitive case, would have to upgrade my Mac to get Firewire, and was a little leery of long-term reliability (hard drive and sealed battery).Here's why the S10 is a great mp3 player...- MP3 audio quality is excellent to my untrained ear- Really small and solid, fits great in the hand- Front panel controls feel solid and give good tactile feedback- Excellent s50 padded belt holster includes a nice spring clip, protection for all 6 sides, and allows full control of unit (even recharging)...I haven't seen the s35s holster- iTunes is wonderful...lots of features for organizing music and the smart playlist feature chooses a random 128mb set of songs from my collection so I never need to decide what I'm going to transfer. Implemented using an iTunes "plugin" so I should be able to maintain compatibility with future releases of iTunes.- AA batteries are cheap and easy to find...in case I need to swap out the included NiHi AA cell on the road.- Software upgradable via iTunesSome drawbacks:- iTunes integration is great but not perfect...you have to launch iTunes after connecing the Rio and if you try to drag too many songs on the Rio I got a series of errors and had to relaunch both Rio and iTunes.- Backlighting is a little dimmer than I expected but quite usable- Radio reception isn't great (most stations have a noticable hiss, even here in Silicon Valley)...just good enough to be useful but if this is going to irritate you get the cheaper S10 instead and live without it.- You probably want to get better headphones, the included set feels nice but my $25 Koss' sound a whole lot better.- 128mb capactity is still not much space if you have a lot of medium bitrate MP3s and SD memory is a little more expensive than SmartMedia and CF (but seems to be the emerging standard). If you need to store >2hrs of songs, add an SD card (note: depending on market conditions, the S10 may offer a better price/capacity ratio...if it weren't for the Best Buy sale I would've bought an S10 with a 256mb SD card and given up the rechargable battery and radio/clock/stopwatch features)- Although earlier Rio players supported Audible.com content this model doesn't appear to handle this file format (dragging audible files from iTunes to the Rio is ignored)- Don't plan on using a standard USB cord, this unit uses a proprietary cord (since this unit doesn't mount as a USB drive this isn't a big deal for me since I'm only connecting to my iTunes machine anyway)

$REVIEW.: Quality Bag, great price, fits all my necessities in a very compact package

I will warn ipad users of the following: I at first purchased the 10.1 version of this bag, because I asked other users if it would fit a file folder with some papers in it
My need may not match others, but what I need to carry around on a regular basis is my ipad with bluetooth keyboard AND a sheath of maybe 20 sheets or so of papers/documents


DESPITE what others told me, the 10.1 version does NOT fit a folder full of papers


It would not even fit if I cut the top/tab off the file-folder


So I returned that bag and immediately ordered the 14.1 inch version of the bag
Although it's definitely bigger (my ipad 4 actually looks a little small in there), it is still substantially smaller than my regular-sized old laptop bag that I used to lug around everywhere.Anyway, whichever size you choose, this is a quality bag
The padding is superb (your ipad/tablet will be well protected), the stitching and finish of the bag is very sturdy and durable, and it has an overall professional appearance to it


It will hold your accessories as well as your device, and at under $20 you really can't go wrong, nor will you be disappointed (so long as you buy the right size for your needs)

I will try to post pictures comparing it to my regular laptop bag for comparison.Bottom line:  if all you need to carry is an ipad and some accessories, then the 10.1 inch version is a fantastic option for you, but if you're like me, and need to carry around some normal document-sized papers, then you'd better get the larger bag
Either way, if you match the size to your needs, this quality bag will definitely do the trick for you.

$REVIEW.: This is a great, durable case that is a lot of fun - especially if you have young children that are Lego-obsessed. In case you were wondering, yes the little Lego guys do interlock with the case, so this is part toy/part protective case.Our kids love the fact that it looks like a big Lego and we love the fact that it actually protects the iPad from the rigors of day-to-day life. As a nice complement to the hard plastic bottom, the flexible cover allows you to set the iPad on a flat surface and prop it up at an angle. This is a nice feature; especially when traveling.Fortunately, the kids are not too rough with the iPad, although there is the occasional drop to the floor from a few feet up in the air. The hard plastic of the Belkin case has held up well during these falls, although it would do little to protect the iPad if it was purposefully hurled at the wall.

$REVIEW.: This 4 GB size is fast, well built and end retracts into flash so easily to protect it...excellent for on the move people, too. Flash slides in & out of HD slot, causing red flashing light on flash, showing when all the way in. Less GB of flash drive storage, transfers faster than those with more. Accidently deleting your flash storage means less info lost, so using correct flash GB size is best way to go, and with this low low price that AGFA store has, grab your different size flashes now, from them. Got 3 day free shipping...their service is prompt, being shipped from their store. Excellent to have free shipping from AGFA store, on such a small item, especially, as otherwise the normal postage would be just as much as this flash ! No flash drive cap to loose....has secure access software if you need that. Works windows xp, vista, windows 7,and mac OS. SanDisk has 5 year warranty. Flash size marked on disk and place to clip flash to a keychain is very tiny...almost useless, unless using small string for that. A PNY flash is good too, but more expensive and harder to find by me in Florida.

$REVIEW.: This is a nice drive in concept, however the design choices makes it fall short of the premise. The main hard drive is very slow, and when you exhaust the SSD cache, this will very apparent.So, will you see a definite increase in boot times?- Yes, you willHowever, will you also run into occasional slow downs, more like sudden crawls?- Yes, most definitelyIt looks like the internal drive is 5400rpm, and transfers ~40MB/s, while the SSD can do ~180MB/s. At least this is what I found with the benchmarks on my system. Both are really slow, compared to modern counterparts. With sustained reads, modern drives can read up to 100MB/s from magnetic media, and 400MB/s from SSDs, making both of them around a third of current top models.Still this might be a good compromise if the pricing is right.

$REVIEW.: I bought the camera about a year ago in order to film documentaries and use for down hill long boarding. The camera works fine in the setting just below full HD, if you want to save some space.  I've been using a class 2 SD card the whole time and it works great, there's no need for a faster card, in my opinion.  The picture is great, so is the sound, only problem is that it doesn't perform as well in low light as JVC leads you to believe. But, if you want a cheap and good camera, buy it.
$review_summary.: Great camera, great price.

$REVIEW.: I canceled my satellite service several months ago and installed an OTA outdoor antenna
 I thought I was getting good OTA reception, but found out I wasn't after I bought one of these HomeWorx units
 I bought the HomeWorx for one of my HDTVs that does not have a digital tuner
 After installing it I was amazed how quickly it found channels that my other HDTV with digital tuner would not pick up

 So I installed it on that TV and all the channels came in clearly

 I ordered a second HomeWorx and now both TVs  receive all the digital stations
 Plus I now have 2 devices to record programs
 That feature is a great bonus
 I highly recommend this device.



$SUMMARY.: If you aren't receiving all the digital stations in your area, buy this box.

$review_text.: Update to Review: Once in a while we turn on the tv and the sound comes on with no picture. Luckily when it's turned off and back on it usually comes on okay. Personally I don't think one brand is really better than the next for reliability purposes. The newer tv's just break easier. My suggestion is, if you plan on keeping a newly purchased tv for a long time, get a service agreement.  I'm one of those people who NEVER buys a service agreement, but for tv's I would reconsider that.Original Review: I looked at a lot of tv's before I bought this one. It had a picture closest to the top end tv's but a reasonable price. I bought it in a local store and was able to get the box in the back seat of my economy car and drive it home without a problem. I am SO impressed with the clarity of the Hi-Def picture, along with pretty good sound. The sleek black "frame" makes the picture look even better. This one is a no-brainer.  I haven't owned it that long; if any issues arise, I will update my review. So far I am extremely impressed.

$review_text.: If you want to pause your movie, you hit "Pause". If you want to start your movie again, you hit "Play". But between the "Pause" and "Play" buttons is "Stop". Here Be Dragons."Stop" means it. "Stop" doesn't just stop the video from playing, it quits out of the Blu-Ray player and returns you all the way to the root PS3 menu. To start watching your disk again you need to select the Blu-Ray disk again, wait for it to boot up, wade through whatever previews and coming attractions are on the disk, re-enable the correct subtitles and menu settings, wait for the various FBI and MPAA warnings, locate the place where it stopped playing, and then resume watching. Hitting "Stop" whether you wanted to or not means you're going to spend at least the next five minutes not watching your movie.The "Stop" button is so big and so centrally located that I can't count the number of times I've hit it in error, either by poking at "Pause" or "Play" in my darkened living room or by sitting on the controller. It's gone from being an occasionally frustrating surprise, to being an infuriatingly common blunder, all the way around to being some sort of perverse comic relief. "What happened? Why did the movie just stop? Did you hit the STOP button by accident again? You did? THE REMOTE GOT US AGAIN. WE HATE YOU, REMOTE."There are three ways that Sony could solve this problem.- They could re-label the button "Ruin My Evening", and replace the pushbutton with one of those covered safety switches that are used in military cockpits to arm weapons. A button with consequences this significant needs to be clearly marked with a protective cover that you have to move aside, so that there's no way you'll end up pushing it by accident without understanding what it's going to actually do.- They could just remove the "Stop" button entirely. Nobody would miss it. There's already a "Pause" button if you need to take a break. There's a "Top Menu" button to return you to the top menu. There's a "PS3" button to pop up the media bar (with an option to quit the player), and an "Eject" button that also quits the player while ejecting the disk. There is nothing that the "Stop" button should do that another button isn't already doing.- They could make the "Stop" button just return the user to the top level Blu Ray menu, and not quit out of the entire player. They could also make "Play" the opposite of "Stop", where "Play" returns you to playing what "Stop" stopped you from playing.Apart from the "Stop" button this would be a completely fine remote with a four or five star review. It's well built, it runs for weeks or months without batteries, and because it's Bluetooth (not IR) it doesn't need to be pointed at the player with line-of-sight to work. It's like a well-built Mercedes, with an extra pedal between the gas and brake that makes all four wheels fall off. WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT.Update: It's actually pretty easy to remove the stop button yourself. Undo the screw on the underside at the bottom of the remote and carefully pry the upper and lower halves apart. Under the rubber buttons there's a layer of conducting pads, a plastic spacer layer, and the circuit board. You can either use a hobby knife to cut out the conducting pad that triggers the stop, or you can put tape over the circuit board contact to render the stop button mercifully unusable.
$SUMMARY.: "Stop" Button Should Be Labeled "Ruin My Evening"

$REVIEW.: I do not know why I continue to go through earbuds so heavily. They just never seem to last more than a month or two. It is getting to be an expensive habit!The sound on these was just fine - no issues. I have a normal ear and am not any sort of expert. I just want to hear my music and audio books when I exercise or do housework. The fit is just so-so. I have very small ears and even the small buds tended to pop out on me every once in a while. They were also not very comfortable but that is a problem I have generally so I don't mark down for it.The issue is these didn't even last 3 weeks before one of the sides/earbuds (right side) lost all sound. I cannot possibly recommend something that doesn't even last a month. I did have my daughter try them on just to see size wise and she said they fit fine -- with the medium bud things. Her ears are bigger than mine so from that side things were o.k. Longevity though is just not long enough.
$SUMMARY.: Didn't even last 3 weeks - although sound was o.k.

$REVIEW.: It gets a 7.5 in Windows 7, 7.3 in Windows 8. That's fairly impressive considering this doesn't require any extra power and completely silent. I'm using it with my 27" Apple Cinema Display without any issues.I tried using on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and so far no luck. Newer hardware is always a problem with Ubuntu, so I'm not going to take a point away for that.Con: About $30 more than the other cards with the same GPU and fan. I can't tolerate a noisy PC anymore after using a Mac Mini for a year so I took the plunge. I looked at two other 7750 fanless cards but the heatsinks looked much smaller than Sapphire's.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this mount based on the price and the reviews.  I could not be happier.  With my Prime account, paid no shipping.  Delivered in two days.  The mounting plate is heavy duty steel.  Product is rated to 165 lbs.  I just bought a Samsung 59" Plasma that weighs between 70-80 lbs.  This mount is more than capable of supporting it.  The only extra I did was re-enforcing the mount's connection to the wall.  I mounted it on a 2x4 wall with 16oc studs.  I did not want to use the bolts or screws that came with the mount (also the packaged bubble lever is junk, don't use it).  I picked up new ones from Lowe's for a few bucks.  I also did not trust just using the stud screws to hold the mount to the wall.  I could access the other side of the wall from my garage, so I cut a hole through to the inside of the wall and set 4 2x4's, cut to size and laid flush against the wall board, in between the studs.  I then ran a carriage bolt through each 2x4 and secured with lock washers and nuts.  Now instead of the weight supported at four points it is supported at eight.  I only did this because of the heavier plasma screen.  If it was LED or even LCD, the extra support probably would have been unnecessary.Even at WalMart, a similar mount was over $100.  Don't waste your money on anything else.  This is all you need.

$review_text.: Ok, so there are some negative reviews here on this product... understandable considering the variety of skills the typical consumer has.But my experience (2 months usage) with DLink and this product are nothing short of spectacular.  I replaced an aging Dlink 625 with this router and my download speednet tests went from maybe 5Mb/sec to on average over 30Mb/sec, uploads went from 2-3Mb/sec to over 6Mb/sec.  That's a 6x increase in download throughput!  Remember, bandwidth is not speed, it's capacity, so when I choked my old router with video streaming or games, it would lag, stutter or buffer.  Now, it's pure uninterupted throughput.  No lag, no buffer, no issues. I made a great decision in investing in this product and recommend you do the same. You will have no regrets.Set up is WAY simple, there's even a configuration "copy" command to install your old Dlink router's configuration for you, I was up and running in 10 minutes. The range improvement is likewise terrific, I can use my iPad upstairs on an opposite end of the house with no problem.  It has a guest network and is dual band... what more could you want! I even hooked up an external USB hard drive to the port on the router and can "network" all my files, this thing has it all.Click "Add to cart" and checkout this new router - You'll love it!

$review_text.: I suffered for a while with a standard mouse.  Arm pains, elbow pains, wrist pains. Took me a while to take the leap and spend so much on a new mouse.  Mice are supposed to be a dime a dozen - in fact I had a few high quality mice which still gave me pain. It got really bad.So finally, I decided to buy the Evoluent Vertical Mouse. After much research on different ergonomic mice and trying a trackball (no way couldnt get used to it) and trying a few other options short of spending so much on a darn mouse - I realized it was either this or nothing - I took the leap and bought it.Super glad I did.  For the first couple weeks I thought I made a mistake buying this mouse. It was somewhat awkward and at first didn't fully relieve the pain. But I stuck with it. Slowly, I started not to notice the mouse when using it (which is a good thing).  I also don't know exactly how long it took but I had no more pain. And I am now actually almost as accurate in movement as my standard mouse of 20 years.While I think 20+ years of using a regular mouse is hard to break - it took about 1-2 months until I was totally comfortable with the Evoluent Mouse - But now I LOVE IT and cant go back. Whenever I switch to using a regular mouse (even those ones that claim to be ergonomic but really just have a curve to them) I notice right away the strain put on my arm.The build quality is excellent, the color and style are attractive. I am picky and find I am very satisfied with this mouse. They did not cut corners on the build quality - very nice.I HIGHLY recommend this mouse and would not hesitate to get it again if I need to.  But you must give it a fair chance to work and I think you will find yourself not even noticing it has cured your pain - which is the way it should be.  Now, to get myself a better keyboard.UPDATE: After using this mouse for many months - I am happier than ever with my purchase. You must give it time to get out of old habits. You might notice other minor arm pains for a bit as you get used to it but it is totally worth it. I couldn't live without it and don't understand how other use regular mice.Now I need to get one for work and I will be all set. In my opinion, should be standard on all computers.

When I used the inbuilt flash, it would kill the original light feel of the pics.Bought the Speedlite on an impulse, hoping that it would help my situation. So far very happy with it. Clicked a bunch of shots indoors to figure out the difference. I am very please with the results. With the turn able head, bouncing the flash of ceiling is giving some amazing results.  Will do some more experiments with the angles and other settings to see what else I have missed so far. I also bought a Stofen Omni Bunce flash diffuser which helps getting better results in being closer to the original light conditions. Just waiting for the next family gathering to really cash-in on my buy with some great pics. :)

$review_text.: Opening the box shows off the Belkin design as pictured. Its slick and it stands well and simple in its appearance. I unhooked my old router. Installed the driver. Plugged in the new router to the model and....ok no connection. Why not? I unplugged the modem and router and waited. Replugged it and. Ok, we have connection. Oh wait. I dont. Why is this happening. The new app, now installed says it timed out. So I removed the blu-ray player from the router and just had the basic internet connection. Rebooted everything and...we have connection. Yes! So I have my PC set up, and so setting up my Apple laptop and iPhone were equally easy.It probably took between 30 minutes to an hour with minor frustration, but it is connected. This has a 5GHz capabilities, but none of my computer have that capability to utilize it at the moment. So I cant say that I have tested it. I will say there is a marked difference in speed and a slight better issue with distance when I am outside. In all, this is a great router for both speed and distance compared to my older one (netgear, which was a few years old).The means of setting up is made for anyone to set it up with a general understanding of how to hook up a router. Installation and logging in passwords should be second nature to most people by now. I am not sure if the blu-ray was interfering or it just coincided with the connection being made. This is the second "best" unit put out by Belkin in their latest generation of routers (Superior versus Ultimate). But for the $100 difference between those two, I would say this is probably the route to go, especially if you do streaming of movies and a lot of internet activity. So for the price, I would go with this one.

$review_text.: I'm in Far North Dallas, maybe 15 miles from downtown, in a ground floor apartment.  The Leaf picked up 46 signals when I hung it up, maybe 25 of which were strong video signals.  All major networks come in fine with Fox's audio being a bit choppy and all other majors running smooth as silk; picture on all channels looks fantastic.  I'm quite happy with this little fella and even happier that I'm no longer paying $1000 a year for satellite TV.

$review_text.: A "name brand" compact system  we had been using for several years passed away (power supply failure), so we had need to find a replacement

 After some consideration, we decided to purchase a quality barebones system and flesh it out as necessary.Configuration:* Shuttle XH61V* Intel Core i3-3240* Western Digital 760GB Black* Toshiba TS-L633 DVD r/w* 8GB (2 x 4GB) Kingston ValueRam PC3-10600 CL9 204-Pin SODIMMOperating system:* Linux Mint 15 (Olivia)The shipment from Amazon arrived well-packaged, and the parts were easy to assemble

 We were less than impressed by the thermal compound supplied with the Shuttle - it is very thick and doesn't spread easily - but it evidently works fine

 Doing it over, we might opt to purchase something like Arctic Silver.CPU cooling is effected via a heat pipe, the radiator of which is cooled by two 60mm fans
 A CPU cooling fan is NOT required, though one was supplied in the i3-3240 package we purchased

 If one could find a "bare" CPU, it might save a few dollars.Now, there was one issue - entirely our fault

 We ordered incorrect RAM and had to do a return and reorder so final assembly of the system was delayed about a week

 In defence, the page for the RAM we initially ordered didn't list the pin count, so "do your research" to ensure you order 204-pin RAM.Having another Linux Mint system, our initial inclination was to go with the same OS version installed there - Linux Mint 15 (Maya)
 With this version, however, there were some issues with the Intel video driver


 These issues would "heal" themselves after some use (obviously a memory-mapping problem), but were annoying

 After poking around for a few days, we decided to go with the current (at that time) release of Linux Mint: 15 as noted
 Absolutely no issues at all after that installation.We desired to operate the system "on end" (rather than flat)
 For this, one must be aware of the cabinet perforations for cooling air - they are on the sides (if flat)
 The optional stand elevates the system slightly so that the airflow is not impeded, but costs far more than we thought it was worth

 It was not terribly difficult to build a stand to perform the same function.In conclusion, then, after a couple of months of use, we are very satisfied with the system

 It is very quiet and, with the processor chosen, certainly powerful enough for our needs.

$review_text.: This Amazon Prime ad calls this Yaesu VX-8DR HT a "Quad Band" transceiver and prices it at $494.  Another Amazon Prime ad calls the same exact Yaesu VX-8DR HT a "Tri Band" transceiver and charges about $50 less. I love the radio, but Amazon owes me an answer, and possibly 50 bucks. By the way, it's a Quad band if you consider the 220 band capability with reduced xmt power a fourth band or not.Update: The vendor, Hamcomm, got back to me and made the case that the 220Mhz capability does indeed make the VX-8DR a quad band radio in the US. As for their price, they provided "free" delivery which somewhat mitigated their $492 compared to the other guys. Somewhat. I also got a $30 rebate, but that comes independent of the price. Overall, Hamcomm delivered promptly, responded to my concerns courteously, but just had a higher price point.I recommend this radio to the serious Ham. Lotsa features to get familiar with so give yourself some time. Get the programming cable and a good program specifically made for the Yaesu. Be aware that if you use CHIRP to program the VX-8DR it will not be able to do anything with many of the brand-specific features  like the Memory Banks which enable the radio to vary memory configurations by categorizing memorized channels.Best for last: When I checked out the Yaesu website last, the rebate on this model was increased to $60.

$REVIEW.: Purchased this little Darling for my Blackberry Curve 8530


All i use the device for is internet, music, video and GPS/APPS so i needed some serous storage space

The biggest part was for storing all of my Map files to make the GPS actually useful
Then music and finally documentaries for when i have alot of time to kill

It has performed beyond my expectations, the SD adapter allows me to move files from my PC twice as fast as using the USB cable

Worked right out of the package and has kept on trucking! I cannot believe i waited so long to get a 32GB, now all i need is some awesome bluetooth headphones!

Portable HD and Dlink DIR-505 loaded in the inside pocket, and still have room to put in another laptop....or more importantly...lunch.You can zip closed the top flap and still have access to an open pocket on the front...and don't forget the zipper pocket by the handle...prefect for holding passport, extra cell phone, and plane tickets.Side pockets are great for holding Power brick and extra battery on one side and water bottle on the other.My only minor (and I stress minor) issue is the the sideload pocket for the laptop.  I've got a large 15&#34; laptop (10&#34;x14.5&#34;x1.25&#34;) with an extended battery (sticks out an extra inch in the back).

$REVIEW.: Finally got around to installing this thing. I live in a marginal cell phone coverage rural area. I surveyed the best location for the antenna up on the roof by checking the signal strength bars on the cell phone while on the roof [max 2 solid bars]. Mounted the antenna and ran the cable. Setup base unit in house. House signal was 1 to 2 intermittent bars now it's 2 solid with intermittent 3-4 bars depending on which room. Phone still drops calls but not as many. I was going to go all cell phone but now have phone and internet only through cable company. Funny though how I can get the 4 over-air TV stations so I don't need cable TV with the hi speed internet service. But can't get a decent cell phone signal. Oh well modern tech.

$REVIEW.: You look through them, things are bigger. I bought these mostly for casual birdwatching and stadium use, because they are very small, compress down to a smaller, pocket size, and were cheap. For the money they are pretty good binoculars, but for the size and price you should know what you're getting. The aperture is small so in low-light situations there is a significant decrease in quality, but the focus is very fine so you can get a good image most of the time. I think I probably bought the best pair of under-20 binoculars I could have found, but at the same time there's a reason why a good pair of binoculars can easily cost 20 times that.

$REVIEW.: I got these as a gift and at first I thought they were great.  The sound quality was good, they paired easily with my Iphone and generally worked well. The large plastic part that went around the ears was a bit uncomfortable but I have a big head and I'm pretty sure they wouldn't push in as much on someone with a normal sized mellon. Unfortunately, the primary reason I wanted these was for use while biking and they do not work well for that.  Their design seemed to funnel wind directly into my ears. Even at max volume they were hard to hear.  After 45 min I had sweat enough that the right ear piece started to repeatedly slip off my ear (it was 50 degrees and cloudy not an over bearingly hot day).  These might work okay if your primary workout is in a gym or walking but for more vigorous outdoor activity they are virtually useless.

I saw these and said, &#34;worth a shot&#34;. At the end of they day, you get what you pay for. This three pack of filters are less expensive than one high quality one but a fraction of the price. Not so much worth it except for the UV filter. If you're just getting into photography and don't want to drop a lot of money on good filters, these will work. If you're looking for a high quality filter than opt for something more expensive and better quality. For $14... I'll keep them and not be disappointed if they scratch or break.

$REVIEW.: I have built 3 computers using this case and I think it is a very solid case for the money

The construction is solid with very few sharp edges


Everything fits together nice and tight with no rattle or vibration
Lots of spots for fans, but you really don't need to add more than the 2 fans included with the case unless you are going crazy on CPU/Video cards.My biggest complaint is that the hard drive bays can conflict with the SATA ports/cables on your board and make for a tight fit

I wish they faced outward so it was easier to add/remove drives.Oh, and there is a little black "corner" piece that is screwed in to the bottom of the case


I am not totally sure why it is there, but you cannot install the PSU without removing it

It is a black piece of metal on a black case and I didn't see it right away


Took me a couple tries to figure out why the PSU would not fit in the bay.

I've tested it with "NexStar Observers List" and I'm able to get the scope position through the program which means the 2 way communication is working fine. All the features of "NexStar Control Pad" work as well (these features did not work with my previous Prolific converters). Ive also used it with NexRemote and Stellarium with no issues to report.The only drawback is the USB cable being slightly loose on the back end of the device. It's not loose enough to fall out, but I can see it being an issue over time. I'm sure a small amount of hot glue around the plug will do the trick when the time comes.

$review_text.: I've had the Zen Mozaic 4 GB for about a week now, and I love it!  Here is just a short list of the pros and cons I have noticed.Pros:Price - It's very cost-effective for the tons of features included!FM Radio - The radio signal strength is unimpressive, but a plus nonetheless, since many don't offer this feature.  Note: the radio antenna is built into the headphones, so with just the built-in speaker, there is no radio reception at all.  Headphones must be plugged in.Alarm clock - I love being able to set the song that I wake up to, and with the built-in speaker it works much like a cell-phone alarm clock.Built-in speaker - Now you can share a song with a friend without sharing your headphones.  The speaker sounds better than I thought it would considering how small the device is.  I wouldn't listen to it for hours, but it's a nice additional feature.Battery Life - When they say 30+ hours, they're not joking.  Very impressive battery life.Cons:Plastic - The whole thing is made of plastic and feels somewhat toylike.  Although I hesitate to call this a "con" because it feels very sturdy and well-made.  If you want a metallic feel, you'll have to fork out the extra money for a Zune or iPod (twice the price).Headphones - The headphones are pretty cheap.  The music sounds tinny when you use them, but if you use nicer headphones, sound quality is good!  Once again, the radio antenna is in the headphones if you want to use this feature.My overall impression is that I am very satisfied with the product.  I don't use it much for videos, but the included software will convert videos to .avi format for viewing, which is nice but the screen is a bit small for using it as a video player very often.  I use Media Monkey for syncing, but you can use Windows Media Player or simply Drag and Drop.Audio quality is great with better headphones and the interface is simple to use.  The design, I think, is very sleek and unique, but obviously not for everyone.  If you're looking for a nice little player to give as a gift or just to stash in your pocket, this is a great choice!

$REVIEW.: I had been looking at Nuvi 265WT for a while and this is so easy to use and its amazing that it shows everything on the map
 The price is a great value and the large screen is nice to see
 I had been looking at a refurbished one through Amazon then after Christmas the new one had a discount at the same price so I bought the brand new one and like this model alot.

$review_text.: So far so good - my wife wanted to call it something so Wanda is the name.  So far she has done a decent job getting me from point A to point B.  One thing is to register and upgrade it to the latest software once you get it - the upgrade came out in early May 2008.  It has performed well and has all of the features I really need i.e. text to speech, 3D view (really nice), speed warnings, etc.  Traffic data has been helpful as accidents occur and the like.  I have used it in Tulsa, OK and in Harrisburg, PA and both times it has worked really well.  I plan on taking it with me whenever I travel for work.  The time to reach destination seems accurate overall however it doesnt update while you are parked at the rest area and will jump once you get going again.  Not really a major issue just an FYI.  Beyond that though it has been very accurate and easy to use.

It seem to be pretty sharp up to 200mm but beyond that I'm noticing some blur, but I think it's better than not having any image at all. also I have TC17E and unfortunately, it doesn't fit :(. notsure why Nikon didn't make it compatible (maybe it will be to blur) Anyways I think it's good lens to carry around it's quite sharp u to 200mm (at f/5.6 to 11).

$REVIEW.: I needed to replace my 30 year old Targus tripod so I first bought another TargusTargus Digital TG-6660TR 66-Inch Tripod with 3-Way Panheadbelieving the quality would be the same. It wasn't and one of the leg supports broke away from the center post during the first use. At $35 with decent reviews I hoped for more. So the search was on for a quality tripod that wouldn't break the bank. I looked in every brick and mortar store I could find and all the major photography websites, Adorama, B&H;, Beach Camera....but I was learning that high quality = high $$$. Then I found this gem on Amazon for $65. I checked reviews on a few websites and the only real negative was the weight. Since the Targus I've been lugging around for 30 years was relatively heavy, that wasn't enough to dissuade me so I ordered it. The reviews are correct, it's heavy at just over 7 lbs. But it is extremely well made and the movement of the head in all positions is smooth as silk. It has a maximum height of 77 inches so it is a full foot taller than my old tripod. But height is worthless unless the tripod remains stable at whatever height you are using. No one wants to have their dslr and lens crashing because of a flimsy tripod. And I was using it for my new Canon 6D and 24-105 L lens. Together they are much heavier than my old T2i. This tripod is very stable, even fully extended and I have no fear of this tripod falling over with my equipment mounted. The two handles on the head are removable for storage and are large enough to easily find and adjust the camera. The size of the grips make tightening and loosening the head quick and effortless. It comes with a fairly heavy storage bag with a smaller side pocket for storage of the handles if you want to remove them plus any other small items you want to stow away. The legs are padded at the top which makes adjusting the tripod's footing sure and easy. I really don't have anything negative to say about this tripod except it is heavy. I don't mind the weight because I was used to toting a heavy tripod with me. If you are looking for something really light weight, consider carbon fiber or something cheap plastic with some thin walled aluminum support structure. If you want sturdy with excellent range (height)and smooth head movement this is an excellent choice. If it were a little lighter I would have given it 5 stars, otherwise it's a 5 star product.

$review_text.: A 5-star camera with 0-star packaging.Now that GoPro is a global brand and traded publicly, I'm hoping they don't need to use packaging as a way to aggrandize their brand.  I'm wondering if they can re-think their packaging to be more in alignment with conservation and other forward thinking companies like Apple (Have you seen how a Mac Mini ships?).  There is so much plastic and paper waste involved in buying a GoPro  (buy a GoPro battery back and see how a small item is entombed in the stuff) - it may look cool because it creates the feeling that the product is floating inside empty space but I personally can't feel good about buying product that has so much packaging waste.  It makes me feel guilty. Why not put it in a cool cardboard box with an awesome drawing or a small window cut-out instead?  After getting all the accessories, I had a mountain of waste to deal with for relatively tiny objects.  It was a bummer.Save the planet so we can continue to photograph its beauty.  Reduce packing waste.My background with GoPro: My photos have been featured on GoPro's websites (and on instagram, Facebook, etc) and two have also been Photo of the Day.  I love their products and their company and the H3+ is amazing and I fully support the company.  Here's one:  http://gopro.com/photos/photo-of-the-day/2013/2/8/It would be awesome if others let GoPro know that we don't need this much packaging hoopla for such a small device.  Thanks.

By coincidence, as we set it up there was a broadcast of  live images from  Hubble Telescope.  As the picture locked on the screen it took our breath away!! It made you feel as though you were floating through space.That was several months ago and even today one of us will stop in mid stride, look at the TV and remark,  "What a GREAT picture!"Do yourself a favor:if your family really enjoys watching TV...stretch the budget if you have to and buy this SONY Bravia. It is an incredible achievement by SONY.

I have one of these on my windshield to capture tornado and storm footage. Works extremely well. Not the clearest picture quality but for 28 bucks I am not complaining. The quality of the picture is comparable to most cellular phones. Not too shabby. It works well for exactly what it was intended for so if your looking for a good bang for the buck then this little guy is for you. I don't think you will be disappointed. Only draw back is you have to by an SD-card. It DOES NOT come with the card and without the card this device will not work.

$REVIEW.: First of all, there should be some kind of separate rating for people who either didn't receive their package or received a defective one.  A high amount of defective ones should of course be considered, but it doesn't make sense that this product should receive one star just because someone got a broken one.  It really does not make sense for any product to get one star just because Amazon didn't deliver it.That being said, so far these speakers have performed well for me.  I regrettably bought the Z323s first, but at least seeing how crappy those were made me appreciate the Z523s more.  These speakers offer a good range of sound, a nice design and nice features.I am no audiophile, but it seems to me like these speakers offer good highs and lows and good solid bass. The problem I had with the Z323s was that there were no highs - everything was just a muddled low sound.  These speakers have highs and then solid lows that don't overpower everything else.  The 360 Sound or whatever they call it seems to be nonexistent though.  Maybe I am missing something.I like the features on these speakers as well. I like that there is bass control on the speaker so you don't have to get to the subwoofer every time you want to do it.  I like that it has RCA inputs in the back to hook stuff up to and that it has an integrated jack for iPods and what not.  I also like the sleek look of these compared to the slightly cheap look of the Z323s.Bottom line is that for $65-70, you can't beat these for a home audio system.  I wasn't interested in spending a few hundred bucks on a receiver and speakers, so I just bought these and hooked them up to my TV and all of the sudden I have great sound for my TV, Xbox and blu-ray player.  The only thing missing is a remote, which admittedly would be really nice.

$REVIEW.: Now of course a LOT of things need to be taken into consideration with any antenna setup, like mast height, actual distance to stations, geographic obstacles, length and quality of cable being used, etc., but I'll just share my personal experience.With rabbit ears, I got squat, even with a PBS station a mere 12 miles away (but it's UHF, so).  I built a homemade "bow tie" (x4) antenna out of copper wall type wire, mounted it about 10' off the ground in an attic, and got 15 channels. (but no VHF)With this Antennacraft, mounted on an upside-down PVC pipe, around 20' high, (actually inside the house in what is basically a huge closet), and with about 48' of quality RG6 cable to a single TV, I'm getting all the 23 station from right around 50 miles away, 2 of which have a huge Nestle's factory in the "line of sight" path. I also turned it around and got 3 or 4 stations from 61 miles away that, according to a detailed site with a map of the broadcast pattern and range, I shouldn't be able to get at all.So, overall, for the price, around 35 or $40, if you're in that 50-ish mile range, I don't think you're going to beat this antenna without paying 2 (or 3 or 4) times the price. And since it's all or nothing with digital, if this gets em, there ya go!(I'm tentatively planning to add a Winegard LNA 200 preamp so I can add another TV or two that will take closer to 80' of coax. But I don't think adding the preamp will pull in anymore stations from the Indianapolis area, because I believe I'm getting them all now. And though it might grab a couple more Ft Wayne stations, I'm satisfied with what I'm getting from the Indy market.)

$REVIEW.: After shopping for a short time for new receivers, it became apparent the "V" part of their A/V capabilities was becoming irrelevant.  My last receiver was purchased over 9 years ago.  My new HDTV has so many inputs, it has now become the hub of my entertainment system.I'm using a single optical output from my HDTV as the input to this receiver.  So far it's working great.  It has all the newer Dolby and DTS decoding built-in and the price point is just right.  Configuration settings are thorough without being overkill.  Power is clean - hiss is barely detectable at low volume levels with my ears resting on the speakers.I didn't need the HDMI switching nonsense found on the newer models.  It seemed like lip service to a new format without actually providing value.  Another complaint is the remote control IR is underpowered.  The range of control (+/- 30 degrees from center) is exactly as the manual describes, but I've become accustomed to more latitude in that area.Get this receiver for its clean power, digital decoding, and exceptional price. I'm very pleased.

$review_text.: These earbuds have close to nothing in low end frequency response. They do not accurately reproduce the full range of sound.  For the price I expect much better bass.  But I must admit that the upper frequencies sound excellent.  Very clear, pure sound in the high range.The earbuds are also comfortable and the wires are thick and less likely to break which is a common problem for the cheaper earbuds.  The overall build is very good.  The interchangable peices are also well made.  I tried them all in an effort to get more bass, and while they are comfortable, the bass is always lacking.I eventually returned these (something I don't like to do) and bought a pair of Denons instead which have better bass but unforunately don't have the good high frequencies the the sure se110 provide.  But without the bass, I'd rather listen to a $10 headset.  In fact VMODA earbuds sound far better the the SE110 for a fraction of the price.

 Mostly for watching HD movies


 It did take a bit of doing to be able to listen to the movie audio through my stereo and connect the video to my TV using a mini hdmi thingie, but now it works great.I don't use it much for reading books

 But it was good for that too, when I tried it

 The screen was bright enough where my eyes didn't suffer.

$review_text.: I ordered two of these to hold my families collection of DVDs, CDs and game disks so that the cases could be put into storage
They serve the intended purpose but I suspect they would not hold up to much wear and tear over time

Once the cases are filled they weigh quite a bit and the construction of the case and attachment of the handle does not suggest it could hold up under constant use

You also want to make sure you open the case right side up of laying down because some of the sleeves are a little looser than others and even with the top tabs over the disks they can still slide out.

$review_text.: I purchased this cable because I needed reliability between my router and another room where I do my studies for college. I was losing wireless connectivity from time to time and this was not just annoying it was a situation that I couldn't live with. In college when I login and start an exam I have only one opportunity to access the exam or I have to get my professor or administrator to give me access again. This happened to me one time with my wireless router. This cable gives me 100% conductivity between my router and my laptop. I highly suggest if you have a situation such as mine that you consider having one of these Cables handy especially if you're going to take a critical exam. I've taken that exams That were 4 1/2 hours long.I nocked a star off because when I plug this cable into the back of my laptop the material that guards the little latch is so stiff I have to use a thin roller to slide It in there and release the latch In order to detach the cable.

Of the three, the LensAlign methodology is potentially the most sound and I spent six hours testing my five lenses four times each.  I finally gave up because I got different readings each time.

$review_text.: Pros:When noise cancellation is turned of sound is excellent. Basses are rich.Cons:1.I don't know what you are expecting from noise cancellation but try this somewhere before you buy. Where I work, there isn't too much noise except some air-conditioning and computer fan's white noise. Passive isolation helps better than the electronic wizardy to cancel noise, which comes with an annoying hissing sound. Active cancellation really did not do too much for my envrionment.(Sony says hissing sound is by design.)And don't forget, it will cancel only white noise, not the voice of people or closing and opening doors.2.If you are not comfortable with In-Ear design, this shouldn't be your choice. I always liked in-ear headphones so it is not so bad for me, but still not the most comfortable. It will be a trade of between comfort and noise isolation.

$review_text.: It's difficult to add much of value after close to a 1000 reviews already written.I bought the Garmin to help me map out some extra routes around the estate and figure out the distances.I would run the square mile block around our estate for a 4mile run, but quickly get tired of the traffic noise

The garmin has made it very easy for me to create a 4 mile run along the green belts and streets within the esate for a much more pleasant and peaceful run.The software that comes with the Garmin is not bad, but I have signed up (for free) for the online garmin connect

It's really cool and allows you to upload to google earth.I tried the "sportstracks software" (also free), but couldnt get it to work."Motionbased" software seems to be migrating to garmin connect"Runningahead" (also free with donations) also worked, but didn't seem very user friendly.The garmin doesn't take too long to find the satellite (typically the 15 - 30secs per the spec) and I found the pacing to be reasonably stable and accurate.One thing I did find curious was that the elevation can change by 50 -100 feet even when you arrive back at the original start point? I figured there must have been either a major earthquake during the run or perhaps the satellite had changed orbit height during the duration of the run...or maybe due to the wobble of the earth..haven't tried the HRM yet7/16/11 update


I suspect there are now smaller, lighter and more featured devices available out there, but mine is still working just great and I still use it to track all my runs and bike rides

I had one small communication or charging problem last year, but googled the issue and resolved it by cleaning the 4 metal contacts with either an eraser or cotton bud plus alcohol (can't remember exactly which)

Anyways a great product and works well with the online Garminconnect website.May 2012 Update:Found my battery wasn't holding charge as well as it used to so sent it to a guy out of CA on ebay (fixyourgps) and for $35 he replaced the standard 800mAh battery with a new 1300mAh battery


Now working great again
Very happy with this GPS.March 2013 Update:Still going strong after 4 years


My eyesight isn't as good as it used to be
This is a good compromise between being big enough such that you can view the display and not being so big that it's annoying


Love being able to see all my runs on Garminconnect

$REVIEW.: The mouse looks nice, but I couldn't get it to work on my new Windows 7 64-bit laptop.  I first tried to install the IntelliPoint software from the enclosed CD, but got a message that it was incompatible with my OS, and I should go online to get the appropriate driver.  I did that, and downloaded IntelliPoint for 64-bit Windows 7, English-US.  Unfortunately, I soon got a message with text in Chinese.  I canceled, reselected all the options and tried again (yes, I did select English-US), with the same results.  I guess I will have to wait until Microsoft fixes this problem to use the mouse.LATER -- Microsoft fixed the language problem with the IntelliPoint software, so I was able to install and use the mouse on my 64-bit Windows computer.  It is responsive, feels good in the hand, and I like the leather-like grip patches on the side.  The tiny nano transceiver is a very nice touch -- much less likely to cause a problem than the older one that protruded an inch or more.  I just wish my desktop computer wireless mouse had that feature.  Now I can upgrade my rating to 5 stars.
$SUMMARY.: After software problems in Windows 7 64-bit were fixed, works great

I wanted a small footprint, reasonably good sound, and didn't want to spend a fortune.  I listen mostly to classic jazz and I don't like too much base.  The tone is fine for me and the only drawback is that the maximum volume is not that loud, but for what I want, listening while using the computer and making Skype calls, they work great.

$REVIEW.: I have a 40 gig iPod, getting close to 2 years old.  The battery life on my iPod was never stunning, especially since I tend to 'hop around' between songs a lot.  But as my iPod aged, the battery life plummeted miserably - Didn't really care while using it in the car or at home, but on airplane trips, it was a major pain.I bought this battery pack a few months ago, and it works very well.  My battery life is now long enough that I use the backlight on my iPod far more than I used to, which in general makes the whole experience a lot nicer.  It is also very convenient that I can simply buy new batteries to throw in it when I need a recharge, rather than have to 'tether' myself to a power outlet for a few hours.  If you have a iPod with increasingly miserable battery life, this is a reasonable investment to preserve its value.Several reasons it did not rate 5 stars:- It is big.  One reason the iPod is so nice is because it is so small.  This thing is slightly larger than the 3G iPods themselves, detracting from the whole gestalt.- The suction cups don't stick to the iPod very well.  It attaches to the iPod via two suction cups on the back.  When they disconnect, only the power cord is connected, and the whole contraption becomes 'gangly'.- When the batteries start to die, the behavior becoes 'wierd' on the iPod.  It starts to skip, believe it or not, and I have had the touchpad freeze, requiring me to reset the iPod once I insert new batteries.

$review_text.: I love the 50mm f/1.8, as cheaply made as it is it delivers great images. I got it May 2010 and June 2011 it has separated without any abuse(or use for that matter on my part). Reached for it in my bag and it halved itself. When I got it it was $99 now $119. Since I'm shooting with a 1.6 factor body, I'm considering if purchasing the 35mm is a better option.This is a great lens and I do recommend it. The downside is the same as everyone else has noted so I won't rehash it, the construction is poor. I'd rather pay more for this lens with better construction and even though the Canon f/1.4 is said to have better construction reviews say it has poor auto focus.What I loved:Dreamy images and great bokeh wide openGreat opticsLightweightEasy to useGreat for low light shootingI had no auto focus issuesWhat I hated(and yes I hated this):It broke after a year. I take great care of my gear and this is the only thing that randomly broke. Wasn't dropped--nothing! Just broke.The lens separated from the mount and I've read reviews where others have had this same problem.Would I buy another? Yes. Some reviews report getting longer use out of their lens, maybe there are a few better constructed copies somewhere out there in Canon land.Do I recommend it? Yes. Try it and you'll fall in love with the optics and possibly primes, I did. It's a sweet lens, just be aware that the construction is poor. Handle it carefully (which didn't help me) and know that some people report it getting stuck on the body but I never had that experience.

 The charging case is plastic and seems a little delicate for carrying in a briefcase or bag without additional protection.Instructions indicate the battery must charge on the shorter lead and the phone on the longer; but there is no explanation and the electrical connections should be interchangeable.I have used this setup twice over the last three days


 The batteries, with active bluetooth and WiFi connections, Playbook Bridge, heavy e-mail, calls, internet, and downloading/installing apps, each seem to last in the 10-12 hour range


 Charger seems to be slow on the power plug provided with the Bold phone; but, if both the device and battery are charged at night, all is fine.

$REVIEW.: I see all these positive reviews because a representative calls you after you buy the warranty.  Does that warrant giving a 5-star rating?5-day guarantee... sounds very impressive... but here is the not so fine print... what is my recourse if they sit on it for longer than 5 days... I get back the cost of my warranty."Our 5-day service guarantee We will reimburse OR fix and ship back your iPad within 5 business days of receiving it at the depot. If it takes longer, let us know and we'll be happy to refund the cost of your warranty."So they can sit on the repair for longer than 5 days, and then you can have the cost of your warranty back.  So I buy a life insurance policy, and I die, and the company refunds my wife the premiums that I paid?  That sounds like real insurance.  So basically they keep all the premiums when there are no claims, and refund the "premiums" when you file a claim.Not to mention that each time they "attempt" a repair that cost comes right off the top of the total warranty liability they have.  So if you purchased something for $400, you get it repaired once, they can say the cost of the repair was $300.  It breaks again, or they don't fix it right, you send it in again and they say it can't be fixed so now you get back $100 remaining back $400 - $300 = $100.  Or they take longer than 5 days and they give you back your premium.Doesn't sound very "square" trade to me... more like "screw" trade.

$REVIEW.: I have a 5 inch TomTom XXL540 or something like that. It's enormous, and came with a crappy, cheap twist-back suction mount. That worked for about 4 trips, and then when I tried to remove it, it fell apart, the spring disappeared, I managed to jimmy rig it, and then it would fall apart every time. Plus even when the thing didn't fall apart, the GPS was too heavy and ended up falling off the windshield from weight. If you're looking at this product, you probably have exactly the same sort of problems.I looked at a LOT of different mount options, and finally settled on this one. Dash mounts have lower stability ratings, unless you have a perfectly flat dash, and who has that? Vent mounts and cup holder mounts move the GPS significantly down in the vehicle, out of the direct line of vision. I bought the big GPS so I could see all the info I need at a glance - and want to maintain access to that info! So I decided I needed a suction mount.This is about the same prices as buying another one of the crappy TomTom brand mounts, but a way better product.What I like (can't do pros/cons, since there are NO cons!)-Easy to suction on - just flip the switch and it's on-Easy to adjust, because it swivels in several places, but each "joint" has a separate tightening mechanism, so you adjust each, tighten it, and then pop the GPS on. Boom, done! and it's perfect-Much more flexible than the little one, since it's a ball joint. I can get it good and low on the windshield corner (so that it doesn't block my view for driving) without having it hit the dashboard or a-frame of the car. This was impossible with the cheap crappy mount. Basically with this mount, the entire mount is "hidden" from view behind the GPS, so it literally only takes up the space of the GPS itself in your field of vision, rather than the GPS + the mount where it sticks over the top of the GPS.I love this thing. Unless it unexpectedly breaks on me (the construction seems to indicate it won't), I can see no reason not to buy one. I'll update if anything changes.EDIT: I came up with one small con - this mount is on the bulky side. Fortunately I have a pretty big bag to carry my GPS unit, so there's room, but don't expect to pack light with this mount.

$review_text.: 12/18/10 - I have re-writen this including sections of experience in using this with different versions of Windows Media Center over the past two years deleting analog comments since those signals no longer exist..


also I have upped my rating from four to five stars as this product has evolved with firmware updates over time making this a better investment than any other computer TV tuner I have owned

Far superior to USB tuners because more than one computer can access the tuner at one time
It is the best way to get a TV signal into your computer
Wonderful picture..
I use expanded basic Comcast Cable as a source

You need to split your cable signal into two feeds; this allows for two different sources (cable & antenna) if desired (works in Windows 7 not Vista or 2005 Media Center versions)


Compared to the 4 other internal tuners I have owned (2-ATI, Hauggeppauge, and whatever came with my HP), hands down it gives the best signal.I have two multimedia computers, one serves a 52" LCD and the other a 42" plasma in addition I have a laptop served by a wireless N band router


Any of these can access the HDHomerun and get a digital or HD TV signal from the bare cable feed.New set up instructions on SiliconDusts web site are very good
When you get this plug it in to your computer, go to the web site and download the latest driver and get Quick TV for testing purposes

If you have issues the support is great with both their existing threads or online submitted request.Vista - adding HD channels to the list of call signs was not automatic but was done easily
All record funtions work the same as with an internal card

I view all of the local HD signals and also about 20 radio stations without added cost


But it misses seeing all of the available channels that my LCD TV sees with its built in tuner.Windows 7 - If you upgrade to W7 you need to add a AC3 audio codec so the Silicondust Quick TV tuner software will work

The Clear QAM is seen by Windows 7 Media Center and allows all the local HD & digital signals to be seen (comcast cable) without a tuner box or security card
 Any signal that Quick TV sees can be manually loaded into Windows 7 MC if it doesn't load automatically into Media Center; lastest software from SiliconDust resolves this for 99% of channels automatically


Windows 7 Media Center is the best way to use this device compared to other Media Center Versions.As of 1/29/10 Comcast has encripted all of its expanded basic services in my area so my HDHomerun is limited to decoding all local HD channels and basic digital service(without the comcast HD decoder)
So I have finally set up a basic set top box to tune the other channels (expanded basic, ESPN, TNT etc
and HD signals such as ESPNHD)


This creates some conflicts between the HDHomerun tuner and the internal tuner that is tied to the set top box; it confuses Windows Media Center from time to time and causes me to have to re-boot


The big advantage to the set top box is the TV guide service is complete for all channels seen by the set top box.xBox - added an xBox and use as an extender which allows me to tune the Comcast set top box remotely and feed the signal to another TV!UPDATE 2/27/12 - HAVE BOUGHT THE PRIME by SiliconDust! The two units play nice together and I have removed any internal tuners from my computers and returned the STB to Comcast

With the potential that the FCC will allow the cable companies to encrypt basic channels service soon I suggest you buy the prime too unless you intend to use this for OTA reception of digital TV signals
I think I will have to buy another prime soon as I am getting use to having 5 tuners (was really nice for college football season I could record every game while watching the one I wanted and then watch the games that the news people were talking about fully rather than news clips).

$review_summary.: It is an excellant addition for me.

$REVIEW.: This is the up-dated model of the VRDMC5


&Igrave;ts feature set is almost the same with one big difference, the VRDMC6 can burn to dual layer DVD+R disks and the VDRMC5 cannot burn dual layer.Except, the VRDMC6 cannot burn dual layer AVCHD disks...and these are the format that dual layer would be most be useful with because single layer AVCHD DVD can only hold 30 minutes of video.The other negative is that the VRDMC5 is clearly of higher build quality

The MC6 is tiny by comparison, feels a bit flimsy, and lacks a motorized disk cradle
The MC5 feels better and looks a whole lot better.Sony clearly cut corners on the MC6 vs

the MC5.I wish I had my MC5 back instead of the MC6 I now have.Sony may tell you somewhwre, before you buy, that the MC6 dual layer capability is not availablr with AVCHD, but if they do, they hide it very well.Buy the MC5 unless you plan on transferring large amounts on non-HD to dual layer DVDs
For AVCHD, get the MC5.


$SUMMARY.: VRDMC5 is better

$REVIEW.: PROS: Easy to apply.CONS: Everything else


 Despite its easy application, this is an awful product


 My MacBook's screen is incredibly blurry with the iVisor AG


 I'd rather deal with glare than the awful quality of text appearance as a result of the iVisor


 What's even worse is the blurriness is not uniform

 The extreme distortion is likely because the film doesn't "touch" the screen

 Rather, it just floats on top of the screen and only sticks to the edges of the MacBook
 This type of floating application likely causes the extremely distorted text and images
 If you press on the film, you will notice that text becomes clearer

 I'm returning this product for a refund.

$REVIEW.: This mouse is very good for gaming. It is sensitive, with adjustable scrolling speeds. It doesn't really have customizeable buttons, so be aware of that. Only big issue is the fact that the LED's don't turn off. Ever. I've tried everything, the only thing that turns them off is unplugging the cable or the computer. I don't think it's idle power in the USB slots, since my Ipod touch 5th gen won't charge when the computer is off, but this mouse will still light up the whole room. Also, I can't find any driver support, and the instructions are all in Japanese or Chinese or something, even on the box itself.I would give this 5 stars if I could just get the LED's to turn off when I shut the computer down. If anyone knows how, please tell me.

$REVIEW.: This is the third brand of USB 3.0 enclosure for 2.5" SATA drives that I've tried. It is by far the best because of a combination of the following features:1. Sturdy all-aluminum case with ventilation ribs on the underside.2. Roomy removable caddy for the drive, drive easily slides into connector and attaches with four screws (provided). Some enclosures have a tight fit for the drive.3. Caddy easily inserted into enclosure, attaches firmly with four screws (provided).4. Little rubber feet for bottom of enclosure, attach by adhesive.5. +5V input connection for instances when power through the USB 3.0 port is not enough for the drive. A cable is provided for inserting into this connector, with a USB connector at the other end for getting extra power from a USB 2.0 or 3.0 port. But the +5V connector is of a standard type for using a common +5V power supply instead of connecting to a USB port. A compact +5V supply is available from Amazon for $6.6. Unobtrusive blue light on the front panel indicates when there is power (solid) and when the drive is being accessed (blinking).Other such enclosures have some of the above feature, but I'm not aware of any other with all the features.I inserted a brand new Seagate Momentus 7200.4 320GB drive, power through the USB 3.0 cable was enough. Formatted it using a Dell Vostro 3750 laptop with Windows 7, no problems. And the Windows "safe" eject works fine. I used a single 1GB file to test speed, got about 160 MB/sec transfer rate to the internal SATA drive, and about 100 MB/sec from the internal drive, quite a bit slower than the unachievable (at this time) maximum transfer rate specification for USB 3.0 but much faster than USB 2.0.

$REVIEW.: This is a very basic flash which will simply blast light... but in the right hands with some test shots, one can get amazing professional results. This is how you get a professional looking potrait pic without the expense - Buy this flash, put it on your camera, bounce it off the ceiling, and click your pic. Take it to lightroom and smoothen it and sharpen it.... and there you go. My family loves me, and every occasion is one where everyone ends up getting a professional looking pic.The trick in using this flash is to first get set the camera to an underexposure of about two stops. Then set the flash power to the middle of the range. Now this is for a photo taken about 4 to 5 feet away from the subject. Here you can use either direct or bounce. With bounce you'll get softer light as you probably know. And that's it.So what you need to know as a buyer is that - this flash works, does what it is supposed to do, and does it for real cheap. as someone else said it one here, light is light, no matter where it comes from, i.e. a 500 dollar speedlight or a 50 dolar flash. and that's all you need to know. It also got triggered by another flash every time i set it up that way. In short I have had no problems with it so far.

The second reason is that there are other channels to watch. These are truly start ups. Rough image and audio. Too many talking heads, etc. Some are good and useful though. Very tech heavy. Can't wait for non tech channels to appear. The third reason to use this is Pandora. Pandora is great for music. Hook it up to your stereo and it is great for parties, holidays, or just hanging out.For the price this was a fun investment and it is well built and designed (aesthetic preferences aside - but I like its simple style)

$review_text.: After doing much research at several sites, I decided on this system


 Partly because Polk is a good name, partly because I liked the connection options

Other systems lacked a choice or seemed anitquated


 I needed more/better sound for my new LG 37" LE5300, and so shopped around

A lot

 It sets up very easily, and the soundbar is very good, and beats the heck out of what the tv generated on its own

 If you want improved sound for just your tv, and not a surround sound quality, you may be very happy with this unit
 Another reviewer did point this out, I wish I had paid more attention to that comment.My two big disappoints are a lack of display on the unit to tell at what sound level you are, (I did not think I would mind this, but I was wrong) and the subwoofer

 I have tried two locations, two channels, and #2 does seem better than 1, but it does not come any where near my old Magnavox MR120 DVD Home Theatre In A Box system ($100 at Target about 8 years ago)

 Still works great--true surround sound, but cannot make it work with any other components--if I could, I would not have needed this new piece of equipment.I did find this AP 3000, brand new (not refurbished or used, etc.) at our local HH Gregg for less than $250


 Maybe I was expecting too much, but again, I have had great sound from an old DVD TiB, and thought this would be at least as good


Glad I did not pay more, and may be returning.

$review_text.: Don't get me wrong:  this is a great case.Very spacious and very easy to thread the cabling through the system.Very great air flow quality.  Running Assassin's Creed IV at nearly max specs with 2 GTX 760s (big cards) in there the entire case, cpu, and cards remain at below 40 degrees (celsius).  Highly recommended.The problem I have is the width of the case does not leave much room in the way of installing SLI / Crossfire setups properly.  The bottom mounted PSU causes the cables on most models to stack up on top of the video card.  With 2 EVGA GTX 760s in there, I have 4 cables with no way to snake them under or around these massive cards.  They stick over the top edge of them almost a full inch, making it difficult to close the case lid, and making the case lid fan almost completely unusable.  Not a flaw in the case design, but this is very close to the typical design specs of standard cases.If you plan on installing an SLI or Crossfire setup, and using any of the larger, high profile cards, keep in mind you will have some limitations with this case, but should suit your purposes nonetheless.

$review_text.: After a few weeks of using it now, I'm really disappointed with it


 There is a really annoying buzzing sound that is audible from about 3 ft away; as a comparison, I've also got the older HTS 1600 and it is quiet, no buzz
 The on/off button at the front only switches 1/2 the outlets which kind of defeats the purpose of this function - the on/off button on the 1600 completely turns the unit off
 I can understand that this can be useful in certain applications but a dedicated on/off button should have been implemented, heck even my $5 powerbar from Ikea has an on/off switch


 The 2 USB charging ports at the front don't work with all USB devices, sadly the PS3 controller isn't compatible
Try Googling the HTS 1700 and there is zero info on this device; even stranger, it is not listed on the official Monster Power website

On a positive note, the unit does look appealing rather with it's blue led display (instead of the usual red)


Overall, for a >$300 power protection device, this is a huge let down
 My recommendation, avoid the HTS1700 or alternatively, try it for yourself but be sure to purchase from a reputable store with a gracious return policy.

$REVIEW.: Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are among the most popular new technologies to make their way into A/V receivers.  I own aSony STRDN1030 Wi-Fi Network A/V Receiverthat also has Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, but it has an awful menu system and GUI when using the audio streaming apps like Pandora.  This Onkyo receiver has a better GUI.=== Setup and Audyssey ===Setup was easy until I got to the Audyssey automatic volume calibration.  For some reason, the remote control would not work while following the Audyssey setup.  I had to adjust the auto-calibration mic's position throughout the room and then go over to the receiver and select items using the buttons on the front instead of using the remote.  This was only a one-time setup but it was a bit of a pain without being able to use the remote.  Once the Audyssey setup was complete, the remote was fully functional again and I was able to test the resulting sound using various input signals like TV and music.  The auto-calibration worked great, and the sound is better than I could achieve by adjusting settings manually.  Video also looks great, and there was no additional lag on games coming from my PS3.=== Bluetooth ===This receiver allows you to stream music from your smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth to this receiver.  If your device has the proper Bluetooth profiles, the artist and song titles will also be displayed on the screen.  The sound is good, and having this technology integrated in the receiver eliminates the need for a separate device for streaming audio.  I tested this function using my Samsung Galaxy Nexus and my HP Touchpad running CyanogenMod 10.=== Wi-Fi / Networking ===You can use a wired or a Wi-Fi connection to connect to your network and to music services like Pandora, Slacker, TuneIn, Spotify, and SiriusXM (among others).  You can also browse and listen to music that is stored on USB sticks or any DLNA-compatible device like your desktop/laptop computer or NAS server.One issue I have is with the firmware update checker.  This receiver has upgradable firmware, but it doesn't seem to want to check for new versions while on Wi-Fi.  I've only been able to check for new versions if I plug in a wired Ethernet connection.  There was no update available as of the time of my review.=== Remote app ===You can download an iOS or Android app that controls most of the functions of this receiver.  I downloaded the app onto my Galaxy Nexus running CyanogenMod 10, Android 4.2.2.  The app works well and the receiver responds fairly quickly to the commands.  You can switch inputs, adjust volume, play music over the network, and perform other adjustments.=== 3D and 4K ===The receiver is completely 3D ready and will pass through 4K signals.  Now I just need to get a 4K TV to test this feature (in my dreams)!  If you are in the market for a receiver like this one, having it be 4K ready is a huge plus for future-proofing.=== GUI and Navigation ===The GUI and menus on this receiver are easy to navigate and understand, but it is a bit slow to respond to the remote at times.  The menus and icons look okay... they aren't terribly fancy but they aren't as awful as the Sony STRDN1030's.  I like that some of the menus overlay over the current video signal.Switching between HDMI sources takes a few seconds, just like most other receivers.  On average, it takes 5-8 seconds for the HDMI signal to show up when switching inputs.=== Two small things that bug me ===I wish there was an HDMI input on the front of this receiver so it would be easy to temporarily connect portable devices to it.I also am not a huge fan of the lights on the front.  First, the LED screen uses green text.  But when Wi-Fi is turned on, there is a huge, bright white Wi-Fi logo that does not dim when you dim the LED text and that you cannot turn off in settings.  When there is an active Bluetooth connection, there is a small blue light that turns on (the typical Bluetooth blue color).  So when all three are turned on, you have green LED text, a bright white Wi-Fi logo, and a blue Bluetooth light.  It sort of clashes and there are simply too many lights for my tastes.  I wish a future firmware update will at least allow you to turn off the Wi-Fi logo light... it is by far the most distracting.=== Summary ===I really like this receiver so far.  With its Bluetooth, DLNA, and Wi-Fi streaming capabilities, it turns your receiver into more of a media center without the need for additional components.  If you have any questions about this receiver, please feel free to ask and I will do my best to answer them!

with the price of the cobra being less than HALF of the 9500ix i was skeptical

i was not a fan of the external gps dongle, but it does have one hell of a party trick; it comes off and THAT is what you update the aura database on (unlike my 9500ix which i usually bring my laptop into the car, windows vm on my macbook, so its kind of annoying to do)the software is MUCH better than the 9500ix, the 9500ix requires you to update the device itself...but the cobra software (once you register the dongle serial number and install the software) updates the dongle


once the software sees the gps dongle (via female mini-usb cable adapter) it will auto update the aura database in like 3 seconds and then exit
freakin sweet! you just bring the little gps thing inside and boom, 3 seconds later its done.performance is decent enough on this, my 9500ix does do the auto ignore repeat alerts (which i love) but for a radar detector novice this touch screen model is about as high-end/easy as you can get
perfect match for my girl


cobra has come a long way and i DO think the aura database is better than whatever is in my 9500ix, but i live in michigan where we do not have speed cameras or red light cameras.i would get another one of these...i can get two for less than one 9500ix


but that 9500ix is overall worth about 3x more than this unit because it still seems to have an edge in almost all areas other than the database (however during out of state trips my 9500ix did show nearly every camera i encountered)

$review_summary.: For the price this is a great detector

$review_text.: I've had these headphones for a little while now (several months) and I have to say I'm not that impressed.I've already blown through every ear "tip" they included with the bloody things


This includes the stuff that didn't fit very well into my ear


Seriously, they do NOT want to stay on these headphones (they last about a month and then start just popping off constantly)


I have my headphones in for at least 4 to 6 hours a day (I drive a lot for work and listen to music from my phone, and I take a lot of calls, so this setup works best for me)


Perhaps they weren't meant for this kind of heavy usage, but I've never had this problem before


I lost my final one tonight, and I'm ordering a new pair of Noontecs instead of more of tips
These headphones seems like a lost cause.The microphone is my second complaint
I'll admit, I have a quiet voice, but I literally have to hold it in front of my mouth to be heard

Nobody can hear me! Even the original Apple microphone performed better for me
I'm not sure if that was a fluke or not, but definitely NOT impressed with the microphone!My last pair of headphones were Phillips and I never had any complaints
I beat the hell out of them and they treated me right until the cord got too mangled to keep going (which took about four years, and they died with the original tips I bought them with)


The Phillips were cheaper, and the sound quality was higher (I went looking for my old pair again, but of course, they don't offer them anymore)

Logitech seemed like my go-to, and I have to say, I wish I would have gone elsewhere

I've been a big fan of Logitech for years, and I'm typing on a Logitech keyboard, and using my Logitech mouse (both have been solid rocks of my PC for over seven years)

I've had a couple of sets of Logitech speakers that were pretty decent, so I figured I'd just go with a brand I've trusted for years
With these, I feel a little disappointed.They aren't horrible, but I'm not going to say I feel like I got my money's worth out of them

I could swallow the lackluster performance and the less-than-stellar microphone if the tips would stay on!

$review_text.: So glad I bought this.  I had a Lumix neck strap and it got so entangled in the camera case and took up so much room that I couldn't see how I would ever be able to reach in, quickly retrieve the camera and take the photo.  And then I came across this wrist strap with the fastener that goes into the tripod slot.  I'm still trying to figure out which way to put the camera in the case but I know the wrist strap is an improvement.

$REVIEW.: O.K., maybe it's my bad for making assumptions.  My laptop is exactly 16" so I bought this case thinking "well, they say it's 16" but there is probably a little wiggle room".  WRONG.  Sure, the outside of the case measures 16" but the interior is 15.1" (as is printed in micro-printing on the back of the lable).I will say, if you have a laptop that's 15 inches, this would be a nice case.  It does everything the description says, looks nice, has good storage room/pockets and appears well built.  I'd recommend it 'assuming' your comp. is small enough to fit.

$review_text.: I have an iPad3 and only gave the first Kindle Fire a casual glance before ruling it out. I was impressed with the screen resolution and audio on the Kindle Fire HD and decided to purchase one for use as a smaller device that I can easily take with me anywhere and listen to audio books in the car. So far I am quite impressed with it. The screen resolution is great, the audio is great and it is easy to set up and use. I have no problem with wireless and it is fast with no technical problems. I watched a movie with my free Amazon Prime trial which was fun and no less satisfying than watching one on the iPad. I have the version with ads and find them insignificant. If I decide to remove them it will only be to get rid of the lock screen which is an extra step I don't care for.  The device does lots of things I probably won't use, but I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend the Fire HD to anyone. It is a fantastic piece of technology and for the price you can't beat it.  I also bought the Amazon leather case which is another great product and adds very little weight.

$review_text.: I was looking to build up my entertainment room, I had a 32" tv and wanted something much larger. After standing in a big box store last night looking at the various options I came across this one. The picture on it was not good, but I figured it had to be the store had some funky settings. It was next to another LED Tv that cost around $200 more, but I went with the vizio anyways thinking I could change the settings to make it work.I got it home in the back of my honda ridgeline truck, it fit perfectly in the bed with the tailgate closed, we got it carried upstairs easily with the wifes help and unboxed it. The TV is massive and when you first turn it on it walks you through a setup wizard.Once the TV was up and running the picture was good, but not great. At least not for watching Hockey. I went into the settings and found the TV had many sport modes, but hockey was not one of them! Anyways, after flipping through the various settings I found the "Vivid" setting and that made the picture of the hockey games crystal clear, you could see the ice clear as day, including the skate marks across the lines. The player uniforms popped. It was really amazing how clear the picture actually is.I've only had this tv going on 24 hours now but so far I love it. Yes the sound is not phenomenal. It's not bad but I had a sound bar I hooked up to it and use that.

$review_text.: Eye-Fi 4GB Share Video SDHC Wireless Flash Memory Card EYE-FI-4SVI only rated this merchant one star because the engine will not allow me to give ZERO stars


Read on:I bought this card after checking the EyeFi website to see if my camera was able to work with the card
There was a link there that listed my camera, so I went ahead and bought the card from Amazon

Of COURSE I didn't keep the box it came in and instead shredded it and put the box in the recycling bin.And OF COURSE I got the card configured and installed and OF COURSE it didn't work at all
I contacted Technical No-Support, did what they advised, but, nope, no good, they told me, obviously your camera isn't supported."But I checked your website and it was listed!" I cried"Nope -it's not there

Sorry - there's nothing we are prepared to do for you." said the non-support rep.Clearly they changed the web page and took out the link to my card, so they wouldn't have to take the card back and give me a refund (and Amazon can't take it back without the packaging).I even Facebooked the problem and Tweeted the company's CEO and nobody at Eye-Fi gave a darn about my problem - they did NOTHING for me to give me any kind of redress.So, here I am, stuck with a non-usable card.My "recommendations" are as follows:1
When you buy something new, even if the manufacturer says it is fully supported, KEEP THE BOX, PACKAGING MATERIALS and EVERYTHING YOU'LL NEED TO RETURN THE ITEM until you;'re sure it works as advertised.2


DON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM EYE-FI, because their support after sale is abysmal, and instead of spending a lousy $50 to make me happy, they chose instead to burn the relationship by telling me I was out of luck
Bad customer service
Stay far, far away.

$REVIEW.: First of all the following link provides a live demo of the camera:[...]The Amazon page appears to be missing some basic specs on the camera so let's get those out of the way.-Maximum resolution  704x576, 30 fps in all resolutions-zoom  18x optical-Min. illumination  Color: 0.3lux B&W;: 0.005 lux-Video codec  MPEG-4 part 2, Motion JPEG-POE  Nope-Comes with:Power supply, ceiling mount kit, Installation, CD with installation tools, recording software and User's Manual, Windows decoder 1-user license.So let's start with probably the most important aspect of a security camera: image quality. This camera excels at that. Although it may not record at megapixel resolutions, the lens is of a high enough quality to produce clear images. Couple this with the 18x optical zoom, and you are able to peel the license plate off a car at quite a distance.Notice the 0.005 B&W; lux sensitivity (the smaller the number the better), this number is very important if you intend on using the camera to capture outdoor activity at night. Even at this sensitivity you are not going to get usable images in a poorly lit area. But if you throw a few lights out there and make sure they don't shine into the camera, you should be able to record something meaningful.However, night time shots are difficult even for the best of security cameras. Don't expect that you will be able to clearly record detail of a fast moving object at night. Thus, if you are trying to record license plates, try to situate the camera so that vehicles will be driving directly towards it -- this should minimized the apparent movement.Ptz functionality:What can I say, it pans & scans quickly and quietly. You can set it to 20 preset positions, which you can flip through manually, or set the camera to automatically visit sequentially. When using the web interface, you can just click on whatever part of the image you want to focus on the and camera will figure out how to get there. If you want to zoom in on a specific area, then you just click and drag out a box, let go, and the camera will zoom in and pan appropriately.More on the web interface:It is slick and functional. The first page you see is the live demo page, which allows you to control all of the ptz functions, plus the iris size, and focus. You can set the presets, and all of the other typical settings (IP, time, video, audio, users). I've tried the interface in IE and Firefox and it appears to work perfectly in both.Software:I didn't try the Axis's software, I'm sure it is fine but it is also expensive. Instead, I opted for BlueIris. [...] software, and it does everything I need. It supports this camera, so you will be able to use the PTZ functions (although not quite as easily), and you will also be able to jump between preset locations.In conclusion, if you are looking for a quality camera without going too high, this is a pretty safe bet.

$REVIEW.: This amp works great as the center of my computer based system.  The sound is incredibly clean and spacious.A few things to consider when using this amp:(1) By itself it isn't that powerful.  The speakers I am using are not that efficient, 87db.  Thus the system is not that loud.  This is just fine for me, but I use this for near field listening, and I am more concerned with music sounding full at low volume - which this system does beautifully.  If I plug the analog ouput of my digital audio converter into a preamp - I have used a Little Dot tube amp for this - the amplified signal into the Amp 100 is enough that the amp, even into inefficient speakers is very loud.  If you need a loud volume you don't have to get efficient speakers just use some kind of active preamp.  However, I don't need it that loud, and I felt that the preamped signal lost a smidgen off the highs and added a bit of noise.  I prefer it straight from the digital audio converter.2.  If you use the lineout to run to a subwoofer, the subwoofer will only work from Input 2.  Similarly, the amp has a switch that detects what is plugged into one and two.  You won't have any problem with the switching if you use only input two, and if you are only using one source you should use input two.3.  I don't need or want tone controls - my computer through which my sound is routed has the capability to equalize the sound if I want.4.  The small size of this amp makes it great for a desktop.5.  If you use a subwoofer, the output line is a pure lineout signal.  Hence it is also not controlled by the volume knob.  If you are not controlling volume with a preamp, the volume of the subwoofer will be fixed.  Warning, if you use an active subwoofer, you need to put an attenuator in the line between the output and the subwoofer.  Otherwise it will be really loud.  I bought someone's homemade passive preamp, which is really just a stepped attenuator, off of Ebay and put it between the amp and the subwoofer.  This both enables attenuation of the overly powerful signal and volume control - although I do a lot of the volume control from the digital audio converter so both will change at once.5.  A simple A/B switch will enable you to put in two inputs and share the lineout - I got a used one for $15.6.  I had a much more expensive NAD receiver with the preamp disabled that I was using before I got this amp.  It was more powerful.  However,it took up way too much space.  The output from this Amp 100 is much cleaner; there is more "space" in the music, and the highs are clearer.  The detail with my PSB Alpa LR 1 speakers is awesome.  This makes for an amazing (and cheap) near field listening setup.7.  The DAC (digital audio converter) I am using is an EMU 0404 USB which I highly recommend.  It gives a number of options for control and the signal out of the computer is incredibly clean.

The Velcro belt clip works great, although I usually carry the camera by its strap which fits through the opening on the flap.  It has a inside slot for an extra memory card.  I really like this case because it is compact and takes up very little room in a pocket when using the camera.  I was not expecting the quality of the leather for this price.  The flap has a snap keeping it closed.  This is just a great camera case and I am enjoying the fact that I don't need to take my camera bag all the time.....definitely a five star product.  Thanks.

$review_text.: I dropped it about 15 seconds after opening it the first time and broke the point so I had to use the spare one which has been broken now as well. I don't know how the second one came apart.  While I was able to use it I found that the handwriting was terrible. It did not perform as expected.  I guess I should have bought a better one.

$review_text.: It's not a totally hard shell, but it seems like it will protect my mac in myTimbuk2 Command Laptop Messenger Bag, which doesn't have enough padding for my taste.My early 2011 15" MBP fits snugly, even with a logitech universal receiver sticking out.The mac seems to cool down quickly enough when I close it that I think overheating won't be a problem. I take it out of the sleeve when using it, however.Some people have complained about the smell. It had a chemical smell for a few days, but now, a month later, I can barely smell it if I stick my nose right in it. So I suspect that the smell won't be a problem for most people.Some people have complained about the waterproof zippers being tough to use. They haven't been a problem for me. There are elastic bands that can get in the way when zipping it up, so you have to be sure to tuck them in before zipping.

$review_text.: Not all flash memory is the same. I used it in my Canon T2i for video and the camera stopped recording several times for unklnown reasons. Canon suggested a 6 and this was a 10 speed card. I don't know if it was the card or a software problem. A friend of mine who used it in his Sony NEX said that the write to card speeds didn't allow him to shoot multiple shots as fast as he does with a Sandisk card (10). He needs more time to sort through this problem, too since he can't rule out all other possibilities.  I had no problem shooting stills and have had no problems in the past with other Transcend cards. Unless  the problem gets worse or I can find a specific reason; I'll still use the cards.

$review_text.: Great picture and sound. 3D is cool but be sure to look into whether your cable provider has a lot of 3D options before buying this if that is your main reason for doing so (also it only comes with one set of glasses). As you can imagine, 2D to 3D conversion isn't that great but I'm sure any reasonable person would have suspected that. Lots of HDMI ports which you need if you actually want to get the most out of the viewing. The apps are cool but a little strange. Most of them you have to access through another app already on the TV. Once you figure that out, you can get all the cool stuff you want like Pandora. Everyone loves this TV and the picture. I went with the 46 inch after going to Best Buy and doing a little showrooming. For me, the difference between the 42 and 46 worth the price but upgrading to the 52 inch was not.

$review_text.: Super fast, easy to configure and setup


 Firmware updates fixed one little issue that was really due to my cable modem
 I think it was well worth the premium price over some of the competition
 Works well with all of our N and G devices
 Range is better too compared to our old Linksys WRT54G



$SUMMARY.: Great - super fast, no issues

$review_text.: I'm a total hobbiest, point and shoot, photographer. In my opinion this is a very good camera for under $200. Generally I have had excellent photo quality from the device. It has a good compact size and LCD screen. It's menus are easy to use and it has a "F" button to get to common settings quickly. Cons The flash position is really easy to cover with your fingers. In large groups like house parties it can be tricky to get the camera to focus and you can end up with a blurry pic or two.Before a trip I was torn between the F40fd and a Panasonic DMC-TZ3 I ended up buying both. I was glad I did. The F40fd does much better in low light/indoor situations than the DMC-TZ3 which is super for outdoor well lit shots.Buy an extra battery and you'll have no problem with power. They charge quickly and are slender enough to fit an extra in a small camera case (Lowepro D-Pods 20) along with the camera. I bought a ATP promax super high speed 2gig SD card and have been very pleased with the write and download speed.I liked the F40fd so much I gave my first one to my mom and bought another for myself.

$review_text.: I have had point & shoot cameras for several years and have wanted to upgrade to a DSLR. This review is not based on having owned several other DSLR cameras. This is the first DSLR I owned, having used others and compared to anything I have ever used, this thing is mind blowing. I would recommend learning a little about photography to really harness the power of this unit, although learning with this unit has been easier then I would have expected.I bought this instead of the Sony or Nikon because it seems to have the largest customer base, and the big brother to the this appears to be the camera of choice by most professionals. The T3i was also a unit I considered, although the T3i is larger it appears that it only has a tilt screen compared to the T2i. I am still on the fence if I should have got the T3i, although $100 bucks to have a tilting screen seemed overpriced at first, it almost appears worth it when shooting at weird angles.The USB computer integration is really nice and I think the camera control software seems really up to date, and not 'crapwear' like what I have seen with other platforms.Video quality is very good, I think the Sony probably does a better job based on my research but this is still nice, shooting video at night was ok.My only gripe is missing GPS receiver, but I guess this isn't really a reasonable complaint, although the Sony did have it.Accessories for these Canon DSLRs are everywhere so that's a real big plus. I bought the battery grip just for added balance (from amazon for $40). Also the 55mm-250mm zoom is a great add-on.Night shooting is mind blowing, I walked outside with a tripod and set the shutter to 4 seconds, cranked up the ISO and was shooting what looked like daytime. It was very dark, I couldn't see anything, but a couple seconds and the T2i looked like I shot in the daytime. Longer shutter time and lower ISO reduced image noise. Point it to the night sky and set it open for 20 seconds and it shows you things you cannot see with the naked eye, amazing!Learned about Aperture Value and that allowed me to take some trick shots with everything in focus.All in all, I am very satisfied and I think this is a great starter DSLR to learn with, $700 bucks for amazing images. And I can hand it to my wife, set it to full auto and she can fire away.

$REVIEW.: I wanted to replace an older pair of wireless headphones that mysteriously lost its frequency. I shopped around, took a pair that cost about the same price from Walmart home, returned them (too much static) tried a pair around the same price from Radio Shack (better sound quality, but not comfortable at all) before ordering these. I hesitated ordering from the internet with the shipping issue, but liked what others had to say about this model. I must agree with the majority opinion - they transmit very well (anywhere in the house), and are comfortable enough. My only complaint is that they slip off my head easily if I look down (I use these in my basement to watch TV or listen to music while I work) and the head band does not look very sturdy. I also like that they use regular batteries - not rechargeable. My other pair had rechargeable and after about a year I had to go through the hassle of replacing an odd battery pack.  I'm sure there are better headsets out there - but at a much higher price. For the money, these are great. - And if this helps, my son has a different brand of 900mhz headphones and neither of our headphones cause problems with the other.

$REVIEW.: Internet media (videos and music) is the future of entertainment and this box contains everything for the aspiring internet entertainer. I was very excited to see Sound forge and Sony music studio included. I am a prior owner of Sony music studio and Sound forge and I was hoping these updated versions would solve my past problems of lag and crashing. Unfortunately not. I am running the program on a laptop with 8 GB of ram, and it just lags and crashes when you attempt to use it. In the past, my version of Sound Forge actually stopped working. I went to Sonys website, had to create a user profile with password, and emailed them; and then got the runaround when they responded. At least I have sound forge again, but don't expect much help if it crashes and stops working.Acid music studio is also very laggy, overly complicated, and problematic. By mistake I closed out some trays. I never hit save, and I closed the program and reopened it to get the trays back, only to have them still gone. God forbid you make a mistake a change a setting, cause it's very difficult to figure out how to go back and change it to default settings. Also, I was surprised that I couldn't find a small bundle of music loops with the program. I'm kind of confused if I can't find them or if they just aren't included with the set. At least when I got Music studio 9, I got a music loop bundle with the program and was given a really good free download of a music bundle on their online website.Movie Studio itself is laggy as well on my laptop. I frequently use Windows media player, which I find more simple to use and edit and has very little lag (after the video loads). I was interested in this product, because you can bypass the loading process for HD videos, but unfortunately it lags too much on my PC to replace Windows media player as my primary tool.I think this is a very good bundle, but I think Sony should focus on a more user friendly product that doesn't slow down your PC. It's worth buying, but you definitely need a high quality computer that runs fast to use it.
$review_summary.: A pretty hefty bundle!

$review_text.: Being audio-conscious, albeit not an audiophile, I bought these to replace my old JBL sound effects speakers as my front left and rights
 The tweeters on both drivers broke, and I needed something new

 Since I needed speakers in a pinch I went to the old two stores in my area: CircuitCity and the Bose outlet
 The Bose outlet had their 301s for $219, which was a decent price

 Because my CircuitCity was closing, these were discounted to only $100


 I bought these impulsively (knowing that Polk is a good name in audio) and I have been impressed
 The mids are not as clear as in my JBLs, but the treble is much more audible than my JBLs were (when the tweeters worked)

 Although they're wall-mount speakers, I use them with the included stand things and they work just fine


 If you're looking for some speaker replacements and want something good, small, and relatively inexpensive then these speakers are a great choice.



$SUMMARY.: Great Speakers!

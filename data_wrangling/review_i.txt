$REVIEW.: I purchased the MIMO UM-710S LCD Screen Mini Display with some trepidation.  I was concerned about the size, the resolution, and the battery drain when used with a netbook.  However, upon receiving the unit all of these concerns evaporated.  The display is bright and crisp and produces only minimal battery drain on my netbook.  Setup was as easy has hooking up the USB.  Windows 7 took care of everything else.  The display automatically extended my desktop so I truly have a dual monitor nebook system.  The unit is built solidly and makes its own case when folded up.  I am very impressed with this unit and highly recommend it.
$SUMMARY.: Awsome Little Display

$review_text.: The fit is poor and whenever I move I hear noise

 When either the headband or cord rub across me I hear feedback

 It is very annoying

 I have even tried the smallest ear pieces and tried jamming them into my ears


 The noise is still very prominent

 You have to find the perfect location then you can't move to get good sound.

$review_text.: This bag works great for my use. It will hold my D90 w/vertical grip, 18-200 zoom, 10-24 zoom, 50mm prime, sb600, two battery chargers and all the filters I normally carry quite easily. It is padded well, with 2 side pockets and a large front pocket and a net pocket in the cover. I like to travel light most of the time, so I never usually fill the bag with everything. The neck strap could be a bit more comfortable. For use on the job, I had a waist pack strap made for this bag and like it even more. If you are going to take every lens you have with you, this is probably not the right bag, but for the average user with 2-3 lens it would work great. You might even be able to sneak your lunch in there somewhere.

$review_text.: I bought this unit to replace the original plastic Aurora amps that came with the old style bass shakers I had. Since I'd installed wiring from the wall to the sofa already, I installed this amp in-wall. It works great and provided much more dynamic range and detail on the shakers than the old amps. Don't think I'd try to build a 70 watt subwoofer, but awesome amp for bass shakers. Simple to connect/install. Just connected the output side of my SVS 535W Sonitube sub to this amp, the output wires to the bass shaker wires in my wall and plugged it in.

$REVIEW.: This is a great product. My only proble,s were lack of apps and although it claims to have flash, most websites that use flash didn't render the mobile flash version. Flash was also buggy and only loaded pages correctly 45% of the time. Without the app Eco system, for me this tablet was unbearably boring. I do however love webOs. It is by far the best OS out there and easy to use. It's only downfall was that it ended up on crappy hardware that was developed by a company who had no real dedication to creating a compelling ecosystem for it. All in all it's excellent as a great web surfer. And for any potential buyers. Netflix will not work on this as there is no app and Netflix uses the silverlight plug-in, not flash.
$SUMMARY.: Great software sans flash, poor hardware

It was a relief the stand came in its own box


The stand itself is cool matte aluminum metal, very durable looking

But the fans are not "whisper quiet," not quite
The whole room can hear the sounds

And the fans speed sometimes deviate, so it makes extra noise


The wind speed is ok, although the noise is heavier than the air flow

This is a good buy.

I never would have thought I could get a projector for under 500 let alone such a feature packed one like this
I haven't used any other "portable projectors" as a reference but there just is no way you can beat the portability of this thing, convert your movies if your using it for that throw them on a usb and if you have a usb host cable for micro usb you have a theater in your pocket minus the surround sound


Put on some headphones and its golden


Once I got this I realized what I need to do with my room so now Im waiting for my 3d ready projector
For having an amazing inexpensive portable projector this thing is the best but for home theater the ports arent ideal and the lumens are kinda low

so basically Im in love with this guy till the 3d one comes haha.

U are basically buying a brand name and their extravagant advertising


Does it come with real gold or real piece diamond then i'm sure a few buyers would like them

Or if you feel paying more makes u feel it does wonders, just get the ones that cost 30 to 40 dollars from any brand

I'm sure that will make buyers feel monstrous

And if you want bestbuy to stay alive (prevent from bankrupcy) like i do so we can do physical inspection at the store before i buy online, than go all out buy this 200 monster cable.

$REVIEW.: Now I am no receiver expert.  I have not ripped mine apart and videoed all of the internal components for you. I can tell you it was EASY to plug in the cords.  It was well labeled. It it was painless, but not extremely fast to set up.  We set up a 7 channel surround sound 75&#34; home theater system driven by a Mac Mini.  None of it was necessarily hard to figure out.  The auto set up was easy in the fact that once the speakers were in and the peripheral devices were in then it works itself.  You have to choose which set-up you have, the pictures of different set-ups appear on the screen. You plug in a microphone (included) and then take it around the room.  The system senses the speakers, adjusts their volume for perfect viewing, and you are able to fine tune adjustments post setup.  The bulk of the work is done.A couple of gripes I do have.  The airplay feature is only audio.  I suspected this upon purchase, but hoped for different since no where could I find this in certain terms.  Here are certain terms: AIRPLAY IS ONLY AUDIO, NOT VIDEO.Overall we love this product.  It updates easily and not every day.  It plays great music, and in my opinion there is no video distortion at full HD.

Excellent and patient telephone support.  Extensive forum website(s) can help on basic and advanced topics.  The product can be stubborn and sometimes no upload ensues after a picture is snapped, but it will catch up the next time it transmits.  The product will develop over time, I'm sure, as it already has, though cameras themselves will begin to provide wireless upload features more and more, e.g. the new Nikon D5200.

$REVIEW.: I really wish I could say I was happy with these, because really wanted to be. But I'm just not. After reading the reviews, and seeing the price, I thought these were the in-ears I had been searching for. But ultimately I've been disappointed.I do agree that the sound is good (again, especially at this price) and the accessories are quality. Nice case, many choices of tips to fit your ear, etc. But the pros stop there for me.The cord itself is wrapped in plastic, which makes it pretty stiff. Not a huge deal but it results in what I feel is a lot noise being transferred to the earbuds when you're moving. More than any other set of in-ears I've had. I was hoping to use these for both listening to music at my office, and also when running. After about an hour at the office the sound from my regular movements drove me nuts. I felt like I couldn't escape it.My other complaint is the memory wires intended to hold the earphones in place. They do work... at first. When I go for a run I get them wrapped around my ear as tight as possible, and they're great for about the first half mile. Then they start to loosen. I tighten them up again, and the same thing happens. It's really annoying because the sound is great when these things stay in your ears, but I just can't get them to. And obviously once they're out of your ears the sound is sub-par. I've tried 3 different sets of the supplied buds and the same thing has happened each time.I don't like to complain about a product just to complain. And these certainly do have some pros. But they weren't the answer for me.

$review_text.: I have the iPad, Galaxy 10.1 Note and compare to this Xperia Z tablet, the Z tablet is a bit ahead. It is the price factor that takes it down to 3 stars from a 5. The biggest problem are the underpower and weak wireless. The pros that ipad and galaxy cannot compete are the battery life, screen color, micro usb charging, weight and camera. So, if you have the others, hang on for the next version. If you want to get a new tablet, get the 32GB version.

$review_text.: Very fast. It works. I had a dual core Athlon X2 5200+, and it was bottlenecking my system. Especially with GTA IV, which is optimized for three and four-core CPU's. I upgraded to this processor and got a 20 fps increase in that game, which made a huge difference. But I was suprised, it didn't really make any difference for Flight Simulator X. I have the latest patch for it, which is supposed to include better support for multi-core processors for faster performance, but I don't know if I believe that now. Anyway, it's a great processor. I use a Zalman 9700 and it keeps the processor plenty cool.I have an ASUS Crosshair motherboard which can automatically overclock the CPU based on temperature and need, so I just let it do that because it works suprisingly well. I probably couldn't do it much better myself.Also, my motherboard is only AM2, not AM2+. This processor WILL work on AM2 boards, BUT, you won't be able to use the L3 cache (which is a pretty big deal) unless you have an AM2+ board. Overall, great processor.

Minus 1 star for this...Front panel audio has a common problem with noise
I still have to fix it, but the common solution is to use a different internal cable to connect it, or do a DIY solution on shielding it to stop the noise.In short, I'm really happy with it, so far is the best gaming ITX/DTX case you can find.

$REVIEW.: Firstly, let me start by saying that my review excludes the video features. I have not used that as yet, and did not buy for video.Audio Playback quality :------------------------I would have to say it is pretty decent. But I have not compared it to other players. It does have a built-in equalizer with presets and a custom EQ that you can set.FYI : CAR ADAPTOR and CAR Playback :-------------------------------------I used to connect a MP3 CD player via my Car Cassette adaptor before. I am quite certain that the Sansa has lesser quality than that cheap CD player. I did use the same car casette adaptor. Its still good though IN THE CAR. I playback FM from the Sansa FM tuner through my car stereo as opposed to the Car FM tuner. Quality is not as good as the car tuner but still decent. Benefit: You can hit record when a good song plays whilst you drive.Earphones :-----------I did not like these. They are loud enough. But distort. Invest in decent earphones like the Shure if you expect good quality.  On some material, I would not be able to turn it all the way up (prob even in noisy surroundings).FM Recording :--------------Recording quality is decent for later identification but poor if you wish to use it like a downloaded mp3. It records in WAV and I think it has a limit of 2+ mins. You can pause and resume the recording. I plug this into my car via a car adapter. When I like a song, a single press starts recording FM. Channel Reception is decent to good when in the car. Indoors, it does not pick all channels. When you record FM, it prefixes the file with the channel freq eg FM95_5_....wavThe interface is very easy to use and looks pretty good. Many people have talked about no STOP button. The pause button is your stop button. You do not need a stop button as this has no moving parts and is a flash drive. So there is no wear on the device if you pause it.Battery life :--------------Its pretty good. I set the display brightness low and the backlight on for 5 secs before auto-turnoff. I estimate it to go for at least 12 hrs. But it could go for 15-18 too, I guess.CONS :------Proprietary USB cable means you can only charge from that cable, buy another for approx $12 or purchase a USB car/wall adapter for this device.The headphones are cheap but I was not expecting better for the price.CONCLUSION :------------Worth it for the price, features & quality. If you are considering it for video, please research it.

$review_text.: Update:  1.5 years after buying it, this thing still works like a champ.  I have never had to reset it or anything - still great.  Love having the 'N' hookup!I just upgraded my router at home to the Linksys/Cisco Gigabit N Router and was using a bridge/access point from SMC for my slingbox.  I attempted to get back into the SMC bridge and reconfigure it to work with my new router (new password and SSID) - but spent hours (4) trying to get it to work with my new router.So I gave up - and decdied to buy an 'N' bridge/access point.  I bought the Linksys Dual-Band Wireless N Gaming Adapter.  Within 5 minutes of getting home (literally) I had it configured and working with my slingbox.  This thing couldn't be easier - and I immediately noticed the improvement in quality of the video as well.  If you are using this for a game system - you should have no worries at all - this thing rocks.  I can't speak about any other routers being used with it, but I know for a fact it is quick and easy using the LInksys router.

$REVIEW.: I bought this speaker after seeing one of my G+ friends do a video review on it on YouTube: [...] and so I figured what the heck, just buy the thing, if its anything like there external battery packs the quality should be outstanding.Here are some of the Technical Specs of the speaker:1. 4W / 2in driver and bass port2. 15 to 20-hour playtime via a built-in 2100mAh Li-ion battery3. Automatically connect to the last-connected device when turned on enables one-step music streaming4. Compatible with all Bluetooth-enabled devices (2.1 and over). 3.5mm audio port for non-Bluetooth devices.5. Outstanding connection range of up to 33 feet.6. Dimensions: 2.7 x 2.7 x 2.4 inches ; 5.9 ounces; Shipping Weight: 8.8ouncesUpon taking it out of the box and playing the speaker for the last week I have come to the conclusion that this is a great little speaker with amazing sound considering both how little it costs and the size of the thing.As for me, I use it with my Samsung Note 3 to play music on when at home and moving from room to room instead of using my bigger 5.1 surround sound speakers and I use it when I am asleep to play my alarm clock tune on the phone, the built in speaker on the Note 3 is not that loud.  This speaker is loud enough to wake the dead.The speaker is EASY to pair up to any device and like the specs state it auto connects to the last device it was connected to when turned on (and Bluetooth is enabled on the phone).  Separate volume controls on the speaker itself allow you to easily raise and lower the volume, basically you don't even need to read the instruction manual, that is how easy this thing is.Charging the device is made possible by the included Micro USB cable and as I experienced once last week it tells you when the battery is getting low by a voice that states "Battery is getting low"!Edit:Only one things I would like to see changed on the speaker;1. I would love to see this speaker have a high/hat type on/off button on it as apposed to the sliding on/off switch which at times seems a bit difficult to turn on/off.Minor gripe, other that this is a great little speaker that comes highly recommended.
$SUMMARY.: Great sounding speaker in such a small package.

Had to call ATT and they replaced the Uverse receiver (without any cost to us by the way).  It may not have had enough air circulation and overheated...but not sure.  Regardless, I will need to look for another splitter, maybe with a built-in fan if there is such a thing.  This may work for you but, like other reviewers have said, it seems to have a limited shelf life. :(

$review_text.: Because the Garmin Edge 200 is so simple, you dont need to charge it very often. It can remember your last 100 trips, display your speed and distance, and time traveled. It can also be uploaded to the computer using Garmin Connect so you can track and share your rides. (they never believe you really hit 50mph).If you want GPS navigation, you need to get a different unit, dont bother with the 800's they are way too much money, the Garmin Edge Touring does GPS directions if that is what you are seeking.

$review_text.: Monster's still out there suckering people, it seems.Quality HDMI cables in this length, which work perfectly, can be had for $10 or less from monoprice dot com and elsewhere - no need to waste money on these gimmicks.  A very long run might (MIGHT) demand higher quality and better shielding, but for a 6-foot length like this an inexpensive cable will work perfectly well.  I have a dozen or so in use now on a high-end 58" plasma with 5.1 surround sound and everything works well.Save $70 to spend on Blu-ray movies and don't be fooled by PT Barnum-style razzle-dazzle.

$REVIEW.: I've used the electric battery charger three times in the last week.  Since I have three batteries for my camera, I decided to charge them all so they'd be available when needed.  Upon opening the package I was worried because the size and shape is different than the original.  I placed the battery in one of the corners so it lines up with the "metal" heads.  There's no movement from the proper placement and it worked fine and quickly.I have not used the car charger yet.No problems, so not much to say.  But, then, isn't that what you want from a product?

$review_text.: I chose this fan over some of the others and I'm glad I did.  The large fans work great to pull the heat off of the CPU and it is very quiet.  It comes with thermal paste so you don't need to buy extra.  I also wasn't sure if it would work with the newer Haswell processor, but it does.  One other cool feature is that you can remove one of the fans and use it separately in the case.

$review_text.: I bought one of these a couple of years ago - and liked it well enough THEN that I bought another.  The first one - I put immediately into use with a 1.5TB HDD.  The second (bought a few months later) I assembled (also with a 1.5 TB HDD) - but DID NOT use - it just sat on the shelf "just in case".One year later - the first HDD dies.  Won't spin up.I take down the SECOND enclosure from my shelf with its unused 1.5TB HDD and back to work.  9 months later - guess what?  The drive WON'T SPIN UP!  Thinking it might be the interface, I put the drive in the FIRST Rosewill enclosure (which I had kept).  Again - NOT a PEEP - drive won't spin up.So I try a TWO DIFFERENT drives (ones I KNOW are working) in EACH of the two Rosewill enclosures. Not a peep - NEITHER will spin up.Well - lets try one more thing.  I have a Thermaltake Max4 enclosure - I put the 'dead' drive in there - and it BUZZES - 4 times - then quits!  I lightly 'tap' the drive a few times in each orientation - put it back in the Thermaltake and apply power.  The first buzz - it starts to spin - but quits. Power off - a few more taps - apply power:  Buzzz - quit; buzz - whine - spinup - SUCCESS!!  The drive spins up.  UNFORTUNATELY - many of the files on the disk are CORRUPT (recovery attempt now underway - but just the SCAN will take 16 hours)..In my experience: These Rosewill enclosures not only KILLED TWO 1.5 TB HDDs, but SELF-DESTRUCTED in the process.  Your mileage may vary.

$REVIEW.: This is my first video camera and I am a geek so please pardon me if I get a little technical as I'm the kind of guy who shops simply by comparing specs.Before this, my only experience with video cameras where those that I borrowed from friends and family over the years to cover the occasional family event - I prefer shooting with a still camera. I have been shooting with SLR's for the past 25 years (all Nikons from the FM2 to the D3) so I am biased towards prints presentation and web sharing. This makes me a johnny-come-lately into the camcorder world.2008 saw the confluence of our first HDTV, Canon's release of an affordable true HD-resolution camcorder, and cheap flash-memory storage. So it finally hit me that *right now* is the time to get into recording life's sweet moments on "tape." (And at 16:9 1920x1080 resolution at that! I'm a geek remember?)I live in a developing country in Asia where new gizmos are always late to market and priced 30-50% more so the only way to find what I want is to shop online by specs. I've compared and read every user review of all the available models from Sony, JVC, Panasonic, and Canon and the recently-announced and released HF100 sure got everything right on paper! I received my Amazon package 2 days ago and I'm happy to report that this little gem is EXACTLY what I wanted and expected!These are what I was looking for and which, happily, I got:1. Flash-memory based recording on SDI can't deal with tape nor am I comfortable with a spinning drive inside a piece of equipment that I might drop. Sony's Memory Sticks don't fit my world and with Transcend Class 6 16Gb SD cards priced at only $74, the HF100 is perfect for my workflow! (I spend 10-16hrs a day in front of a PC.)I've decided to shoot all my material using FX mode and a 16Gb card is good for 2hours worth of video. (Side note: the standard BP809 battery is good for only about 1hr so you better get an extra one.)2. True HD qualityI still have to get myself a HDMI cable but the component-out signal on my LCD is crisp and more than what I expected! To my eye, it's as good as the prosumer-level models that I've been wanting to get but can't justify.3. Fast focusThe focusing works darn well. It's not 100% but it's very close. And this is from a guy who's spoiled by the fast- and multi-point focusing of pro-level DSLR's and lenses.4. OISGenerally works, you gotta give it a half-second or so to stabilize and the LCD viewfinder is a great way to balance the unit with 2 hands. Once you zoom all the way to 12x though, I recommend using a tripod esp when shooting for long periods of time (like stage performances).5. Output filesThe files are saved in MTS format and after Googling for half an hour, I was able to download a couple of freeware transcoders and converted a 46-second 89Mb 1920x1080 clip and downsized it into a 16Mb 848x480 XVid AVI which is gentler on my Mediagate MG-350 hard disk media player. I intend to archive all originals on BluRay and downsample the files to make it easier to share, think YouTube, Windows Media Player, hard disk media players, iPhones, etc...6. Size and buildYep, it's really the size of soda can and very, very insconspicuous. It has metallic gun metal finish and, although not as aesthetically pleasing as the black HF10, it's better-looking than the pics on the web. The size is a welcome change from the routine harassment I get from overzealous mall security who thinks I'm out to make a quick buck selling pictures of mall scenes and/or architecture everytime I fish out my so-called 'professional' DSLR. I shot all day today and no one even noticed. The build is perfect, like what we're used to expect from high-quality, super-miniaturized products from Japan. For what it's worth, the unit I got is labeled Made in Japan.7. User interfaceI haven't read the manual yet as the basic camcorder stuff is easy. But I concur with the observation that the START/STOP and CAMERA/VIDEO RECORD/PLAYBACK switches could have been designed better. I prefer the Sony approach where a rotating collar representing the different modes rings a big round red button. The on-screen menu can be better but it's liveable. I'm so used to the intuitive interface of Nikon cameras so I guess I shouldn't be surprised that (just) some of the quirkiness of Canon's camera interface design can also be found on their camcorders. For example, there are way too many clicks to get a clip deleted. I also wish that scrolling through the clips is fast as browsing through a digicam's thumbnails.8. OpticsBased on what I see on the LCD TV, they're great! I'm a wide-angle shooter so my next purchase is a 0.5x wide angle converter, but I'm now hesitating against buying the $50 models as they may not do justice to the camcorder outstanding optics. Information on photographic lens quality such as resolving power, MTF charts, etc.. are readily available online but there seems to be less on video-related optics so I gotta spend some time finding the right one for this.9. Control layoutI think the layout is okay. The AV jack, HDMI jack, and composite jacks are on 3 separate sides, I hope they can put them all on one side in the next iteration. Oh, the tactile feel, location and size of the photo capture button is awkward. Coming from a DSLR, how I use/misuse this button often results in blurred pictures esp when in dim light. There's just no way of releasing the shutter without causing camera shake. But then again, why use a camcorder as a camera? :P10. AudioI think the audio recording is okay, it records my narrative clearly. I haven't shoot enough to judge how audio from the subject sounds like but I will attend a beach wedding in a couple of weeks, so I'll report back on how the wind filter and audio pickup performs in such an environment.I'm truly happy with this purchase. After 2 days with it and experimenting on post-production workflow, I'd rate this product a 10/10.Get one!---2008.05.01 UpdateStart up time from stand-by is 1sec. Start up time from dead cold is 6 seconds regardless of your flash capacity (I tried it on 1, 4, and 16Gb) and regardless of how many clips are already in it.Finalists on my list before I got the HF100 are the Sony HDR-CX7 and the Panny SD9. They're worth taking a look and the reviews should tell you why I chose the HF100 instead.I've just finalized my AVCHD to DVD workflow and it basically involves transcoding from MTS > AVC (Using DGAVCIndex) > MPEG2/DVD (Using ConvertXToDVD & AVISynth). I don't have a Blu-Ray player yet so I'll figure out that workflow some other time. Checkout [...] for all the tips and tricks you'll ever need.I think my DSLR's will see a lot less action in as far as shooting family is concerned. :)---2008.05.03 UpdateFor easy 1-step conversion of AVCHD files to DVD discs, one probably has to use commercial software such as iMovie, Nero 8, ULead 11, etc...The geek in me was somehow drawn to open source/freeware software I found via the [...] forum, specifically as illustrated in this thread - [...]I learned (over the past few days) that AVCHD recording saves your material as an MTS file which you'll find in the STREAMS subdirectory. MTS files combine the actual AVC video (MPEG4/H264 format) and AC3 audio into a single 'stream.' As such, you need to demultiplex or split up the streams into their individual video and audio components before you can get any transcoding done (conversion from one format to another).To demux the MTS file, I used a software called DGAVCIndex (downloadable via a link in the above thread) and a utility called AVISynth which acts as a frameserver or translator to a final software that creates your final output. The final software I chose to use are VirtualDub for creating DivX- or XVid-encoded AVI files which you can view on your PC. On the other hand, I use ConvertXtoDVD to create DVD discs that I can view on any DVD player out there.Yeah, that made my head spin too!Anyways, that's DGAVCINDEX to split, if you don't split you won't get anything done. AVISYNTH to act as a pre-processor for the split files - add fade-in/out, resize, sharpen, adjust color, etc... CONVERTXDVD takes that pre-processed files and convert/burn the output directly to DVD.Those are all freeware but the commercial stuff aren't too expensive either. I just hope that the little explanation helps you better understand/appreciate the conversion process. I heard that it wasn't this easy dealing with AVCHD files as late as a year ago.Happy shooting!

$REVIEW.: I bought the BlackArmor 320GB to review as a possible site-wide solution for protected storage


In my opinion it's unsuitable for situations where (1) multiple users may access a PC, (2) users might expect to walk away from the PC leaving the drive attached, or (3) users don't have administrative rights on their PCs.As another reviewer already mentioned, the drive remains decrypted even when the Windows system is logged off or rebooted


That seems to be a poor design decision to me, as it means that an unprivileged user on the same machine can access the "protected" data simply by logging into the system, or by rebooting the system into a different OS (as easy as booting a CD containing MS-DOS)


In that case, the data can be read or overwritten.Also, before purchasing I contacted Seagate's pre-sales technical support and asked a question based on my understanding of the way the drive works, gleaned from reading their support forum postings
I asked, "is this accurate, that administrative rights are required for initial installation, but once the drive's been installed on a particular machine, it can be accessed by an unprivileged user?" I asked, anticipating that our system admins could perform a one-time installation and then let users run as non-admins for the bulk of their work
I was answered in the affirmative, which is NOT the case: administrative rights are required to "unlock" the drive; if (other than in the problem scenario described above) a non-admin attempts to run the launcher program, he'll receive the message, "Please run this application in administrative mode" (or words to that effect).The support executables (running in memory and viewable in Task Manager) also conflict with my (pretty basic) setup, such that CD/DVD reading and burning sometimes fails, as if no media were present

That might be unique to my system (for instance, corporate policy disables autostart) but with the popularity of autostart-based attacks, similar policies might become more common.Anyway, my recommendation would be to approach BlackArmor with caution if your circumstances are similar to those described above

Hope this helps someone ...

$REVIEW.: if you have an EM-5 like me, you need this card. Don't bother with whatever transcend thinks is class 10. 95mb/s is what you need to shoot 9fps and 1080p and not wait around for card writing.This is 2012! we don't have time for orange blinky lights on the back of cameras!If you use this card, by the time you have pulled your eye away from the viewfinder, the image is already written. No waiting at all. I threw this card in my fuji x100 which normally takes a good 5 seconds to write and it was instantaneous.If your camera shoots at 12mp or up you'll need a 32gb over the 16bg. They are built tough anyway and don't corrupt like other cards. 64gb and 128gb are a waste of money, just buy 2 32bg cards but wait until they are on special45mb/s are good too but this is leagues better

$review_text.: The one advantage this product has over every other digital video camera on the market is simplicity.  All you have to do is turn it on, point it at your subject, and press the big red button.  That's it -- you're shooting video.  Press the big red button again and you're done.  When you get home, pop out the USB connector, stick it into the computer, and your videos are ready for viewing and sharing.  It couldn't be simpler.  And it's fun!With that in mind, I was expecting slightly better video quality, considering how much this thing costs.  This camera has a fixed-focus lens (like you'd find on a cell phone), no optical zoom, and no image stabilization.  The lack of image stabilization is a big problem.  This thing is tiny and is meant to be held with just one hand (and, in fact, it's not really possible to comfortably hold it with two hands).  That's a perfect recipe for shaky images.  Sure enough, I found that it's basically impossible to get shake-free images with this camera unless I use a tripod or monopod... which sort of defeats the purpose of having a pocket-sized camera.Keep in mind that most of the point-and-shoot digital cameras currently on the market today -- I'm talking about the ones that take still images -- can also shoot HD video.  They have real autofocus lenses with real optical zoom, and most of them have image stabilization as well.  I don't quite understand why the Flip costs the same price as these other cameras, even though it has far fewer features.  Or rather, I don't understand why you would spend that money on a Flip when you can get a better camera for the same price.  Unless, as I said earlier, simplicity is the biggest factor in your purchase decision.  Even so, the other cameras are pretty darned simple... you just point and shoot (although you might have to change a couple of menu settings first).Two things that pleasantly surprised me about this camera: it's very well constructed and has a nice solid feeling in the hand, and the audio quality is better than any of the other cameras I've used.If simplicity and ease-of-use are important to you, give this camera a serious look.  If you want great looking video images, you may need to look elsewhere.
$SUMMARY.: If simplicity is what you want, this is the video camera to get

$review_text.: This is a high-end headset. It is significantly better than the standard earphone/mic combination that comes with the iPod Touch. The wide range of ear cushions and foam inserts allows a semi-custom fit. Most earphones have three sizes and getting a proper fit is invariably more miss than hit.This headset is not inexpensive. It is more than I would normally expect to pay, but after experiencing its comfort and sound quality, I am a convert. The sound out of this set is excellent. It is very natural sounding with even balance in the low and high ends. I have easily listened for hours without any fatigue. The cord can be worn facing up or down although this is not really something I would use at the gym.As a headset, the microphone works very well. I had no issues using this with my iPod Touch (3rd generation) and the Textfree with voice app. The others did not know I was using an iPod through a WiFi connection; they thought it was my mobile phone.The controls are excellent. They do not add much weight to the headset but are well thought out and implemented. This headset works perfectly with the iPod Touch.

$REVIEW.: when i first ordered this case I was taking a chance (pre-ordered) as it did not have any reviews. Well now the reviews are starting to roll in and from all of them it seems this case is pretty good. I have to agree - I am very happy with the purchase. I will note  a few things that I wish I had known before I purchased - hopefully it helps someone:1) the Touchpad with no case is about 0.45" thick (or as HP calls it, "deep"). With the case on and closed, i have it at about 0.875" thick. The length and width both increase by about 0.25" (0.125" on either side), which I would consider negligible.2) The case does not use a magnet to stay closed. Instead, it has a clasp/hook (similar to the ones that hold the touchpad in place) to close it. I find it a little annoying to get open, as you sort of have to pry it open with your finger tips. At least it seems very secure. Something i found useful is that to close the case, push on the "spine" (the side of the case where the speakers are) of the case towards the right, to help the clasp go over the touchpad.3) fit is spot on. Very snug, secure. I have no worries about the touchpad falling out. Everything is accessbile with the case closed, however the speakers are a tiny bit covered when closed. No problem.4) Material and finish is nice. Does not look cheap. Is not too shiny. Says "poetic" with a cross type symbol in lower right hand side of front.I would definietly recommend this case to anyone. If you have any questions, please post a comment and I will revise my review to answer your question to the best i can.

$review_text.: My original Grado SR-60 pads sounded great, but they were very uncomfortable
I replaced the pads with a set of cheap replacement pads from Radio Shack


After those wore down after extended use, I opted for a set of Sennheiser HD414 pads
These pads were comfortable and the best sounding, but being bright yellow, they weren't very sexy
I decided to give the Grado L-Cush pads a shot, and I've been very pleased with them so far
They sound great (not as profound as the Sennheiser pads due to the design) and they are very comfortable to wear for extended periods

The only problem I see with these pads is the fact that they will eventually dry and crumble, but for $16 a pop that's not a terrible amount of money to spend on a new set of pads every once in a while

On the plus side, they're not yellow! I haven't used my C-Moy headphone amp for a while, but I might have to dust it off and try them out with these pads

Overall, if you suffer from uncomfortable earpads and would like to enjoy music, movies or games through your Grado cans pain free, give these a try

I also recommend the Grado extension cord as well.

$review_text.: Bought the TSi200 speakers for my HT system which so far consists of an Onkyo TX-NR509 A/V receiver, the TSi200 pair and a Polk CS10 center channel speaker. Using RCA 16-Gauge speaker wire. The speakers sit on 34"-high stands.There are smaller and cheaper speakers out there, even from the same manufacturer. But in my modest opinion the TSi200 offer a good compromise between price, and quality for video as well as quality for audio. Initially, they sounded a bit flat. A few weeks later i figured that my receiver is not set up properly. It expected a subwoofer, and they were set up to "small" speakers (which means the bass management in the AVR will filter the low frequencies out of the Left and Right channels and send them to the subwoofer). I made them "large" so they can play the full frequency range. Moreover, by default the receiver expected the listener to be 3.7 meters away from the speakers. After i entered the correct distance, the TSi200 pair sounded MUCH better. (Alternatively, do the Audyssey EQ correction).Note that these speakers are a bit bigger and heavier than they seem in the picture, so please note the correct measurements. I was surprised how deep they are.Pros:- Affordable.- Well built.- Part of a bigger family of Polk speakers that offers multiple options for center speakers, surround speakers and subs that can be matched to the Tsi200's.Cons:-It might not be very obvious in the picture, but the top of the speaker is made from some shiny plastic. Not a big fan. I wish it was wood all around.-The cloth cover is a bit of poor quality. Not a big deal.-A bit bulky.-The frequency response range might leave some of you wanting a bit more bass if your main application is movies and video games. If that's the case invest in a good sub. And make sure you set up your receiver properly (with speakers set to "small" and the correct crossover frequency).
$review_summary.: Decent speakers, sturdy and affordable.

$review_text.: After almost 2 years, my old Aduro membrane got a chip in it (that's what it's there for!)

I got my new set and went through only 2 of them instead of all 3 before I got one to work

 It seems that the stiffness of the membrane can cause it to slip out of your hands before you get it cleanly on the iPad

When you peel it back halfway to get rid of the major bubbles and realign it correctly, the membrane will now have a static charge that causes it to attract dust like crazy
 Once the dust sticks to the underside of the membrane, you are done with that one and have to throw it away
 So I just expect to use 2 or 3 of them to get one to work


At their price, it's still a good deal.

 The other reviews that say you need to break these things in must be written by very, very picky people
 I am breaking mine in, but I wore them right out of the box for the first couple of days while jogging
They sound great! Very crisp highs and very solid bass
 This is my first in-ear set and I'm very happy with them.



$SUMMARY.: JBuds J3 Great Right Out of the Box!

$REVIEW.: As others have said this is a cheap fake camera that doesn't bear close inspection. But, from 10 feet away it looks perfectly real. It is fairly fragile so you have to be careful with installation. It takes two AA batteries which I doubt will last all that long so I'm thinking of how I could rig up my own battery pack. The flashing light is a little to fast IMHO.

$REVIEW.: I got this because it was the smallest FM transmitter for the iPOD Nano.  It integrated well with the iPOD, and I had no problems using it to select the station.  The real problem was static.  I tried multiple "clear" FM channels in the Nashville area, but I could not get a nice clean signal on any one of them.  There was always static or hiss in the background.  I think this transmitter is just not powerful enough.  I tried placing it in several positions in my car as well.  I would not recommend this.  I have a friend who has the Monster Cable FM transmitter and charger.  He has not experienced the same problems.

$review_text.: What I like about this unit is the quality of sound and sheer simplicity.  It replaced a Sansa View that was great, but the battery didn't last much and took a long time to turn on. But what I don't like about this Sony is: memory cannot be added -cannot delete songs or videos on the unit, have to go your  pc. Same for checking how much memory you have left.(I could do all that on the Sansa). (since I am not technologicaly oriented, maybe I am missing  something). I didn't get another Sansa for fear of the same happening again. I welcome any suggestion.

$REVIEW.: I was bumbling around Fry's when I bumped into one of these 23" AOC monitors for a very attractive price. I'd been meaning to upgrade a 19" 5:4 Dell monitor at work, and the nice reviews combined with the value finally caused me to follow through.The packaging is extremely nice because unlike other LCD monitors I've owned, this box opens across the broad side, there's a square styrofoam panel to pull off, and laying there is the monitor and base, assembled and ready to go. Literally press a slide lock release on the underside of the base, unfold the base from the screen, and it's ready to sit on the desk. No assembly required!Further, the power and video cable plug into the base, so unlike my Samsung, Dell and BenQ LCDs, there are no goofy cables hanging down from the monitor itself. And the power cable goes through a stand-alone transformer first, so it's just a lightweight barrel plug entering the base (similar to what you plug in to your computer's speakers), not the bulky 3-prong AC cable.Note there is no USB hub or audio built in to this display.As another reviewer mentioned, the five touch sensitive power & menu buttons are 'hidden' on the base. They are in fact hidden, being white on white -- though they do illuminate with backlights once the power is up and running.The on screen menu is no better or worse to navigate than most other displays I've dealt with, though to its advantage the buttons are much more natural to press being on the base, versus having to reach up and make multiple presses of physical buttons on the display bezel itself.I, too, found this display to be unusually bright. I can't tell (and didn't research) whether the screen is side lit or back lit, but the coverage is very even. I've found 50% brightness to work well for me under bright office lighting, though it's a touch dark for video if I go on a YouTube detour while on the clock.It's worth noting that the actual height of this 23 inch screen is close to an inch shorter than the 19 inch Dell this is replacing, though with the generous increase in resolution, my overall screen real estate has increased (approaching double the resolution in width).Because of the construction of the stand, adjusting the tilt angle on the display is not really in the cards, and the optimal viewing angle is straight on to slightly high. If the monitor sits higher than eye level, the brightness drops off a bit. However, side to side viewability is fine for desk duty.The sexy thinness -- yes, this is real, it's no thicker than my Blackberry -- is lost once it's in use, unless you happen to have a setup where you see your monitor from the side a lot. If I want to show it off to a co-worker, I actually need to point out this striking profile.I did have to supply my own DVI cable with this. The transformer is powered by a standard 3-prong AC cable that your old monitor probably uses, so that eases setup even further (but it does come with its own). I didn't have the need to install any drivers to hit this monitor's native resolution, so was able to leave the CD sealed in its sleeve.The base is just a tad wobbly because the whole screen is being supported by an arm the size of a domino, but I seriously can't imagine this ever being a problem.Want an inexpensive, big, beautiful display for your PC? This ought to get your attention.

$review_text.: This is hands down the worst mouse I've ever used. I'm a programmer at a design agency, so we all use Macs, including this mouse. Repeatedly using this mouse over many hours cramps my hand, wrist, and shoulder on my right side. I recently worked overtime on a Flash website, and at the end of the deadline my hand was so cramped it was painful to extend my first finger.Aside from the less than optimal mouse shape, the biggest problem is the scroll dot. The more use your mouse gets, the more likely it is to stick so you can't scroll at all. You can unstick it by holding the mouse upside down and vigorously rolling the ball in all directions. However, despite doing that regularly, I still have problems scrolling up with it. It takes more force to scroll up now, which cramps your hand and stresses your wrist.I do not recommend this mouse for anybody who uses a computer more than a few hours a day.

$REVIEW.: I bought this because my home network - which was all wireless - had slowed down.  I guessed that this was due to the number of devices using the network (2 laptops, 2 iphones, 1 mac mini, 1 media/file server, 1 printer) and decided that the problem was my wireless network rather than my internet connection.I connected one module to my router, the other to my media/file server and they worked straight away.  There's a marked difference when transferring files from a laptop to my media server - it's more than twice as fast.There's also seems to be a difference when streaming (e.g. from Hulu) to my media server, although not as marked.Overall I'm very happy and have recommended this to friends who need to connect devices on a home network that do not have to be portable i.e. not very suitable for laptops as you'd have to bring one module with you wherever you move in the house.  On the other hand - if you mainly use a laptop in one place, or want to use it where your wireless network gets poor connectivity then it would be fine.All in all it's a good purchase.  Only downside is the size of the modules.  They are quite big and will mean you can't plug another appliance into the same set of twin sockets, or will take up a lot of real-estate in a power strip.  If you plan to use one make sure you have the whole twin socket to connect it to (unlikely as the device you're powering will probably required one of the sockets) or, alternatively, use something like a power-squid.Update - after ~6 months.Devices are still working great - although I've changed what I'm using them for.  They really are a very nice way to get your network to hard-to-connnect places for wired/wireless.  I get > 100Mbps (seen it over 160) streaming to a Mac Mini - it's better since I upgraded my router (which was 10/100 before - now it's 10/100/1000).  That's more than plenty for HD streaming.  They seemed to 'unpair' for a while ... which was a pain ... but I just had to re-pair them and it was fine.  Remember (as I did not when I first attached to the mac!) to disable your wireless - how to do this will depend on your OS.  Some people may be finding that they still get 'poor' throughput when they were trying to fix a spotty wireless connection - but are still really only using the wifi - not the powerline ethernet.  Also found that I had a problem or two when connecting thru powerstrips (see my comments above for what a PITA the form-factor is) - but since I cleared two sockets to use just for this no problem and seemingly faster transfers.  These are actually pricey for what they are (compared to a top-of-the-range 300Mpbs Wireless N router for ~$150) - but if you have a tricky place to connect (basement, back-bedroom, etc. etc.) or your router placement is less than perfect (like mine in the concrete basement) this will put you right.  Haven't seen anyone review using this with a wireless access point to extend their wifi - but that's probably a pretty cool option if you don't need the full 300Mbps of the latest Wireless N.  If you're still using wireless G then that 54Mpbs will be your limit to the WAP anyway ...

The controls are simple and intuitive for a beginner like me but with lots of serious menu features allowing for full customization.  Downloading videos to the computer is a snap with the USB connection. The image quality matches the value of the camera.  The auxiliary LED is a little on the weak side but it gets the job done with minimal power consumption.  I wish I had made this purchase a year ago.

$review_text.: 8-26-10 UPDATE !!Well.... I STILL LOVE IT! Since my last review I have gone to the dark side and purchased an Itouch for me and my Bose. It really completes the package. I have decent stereos in my garage and in my shop. I have found myself carrying the Bose into those areas and not using the BIGGER stereos that are already there. The Bose simply sounds better, way better. People that hear it are convinced. My cousin has since purchased one and so has a friend after hearing at a party. I have wifi at my home and I can tune in Pandora or Rhapsody on the Itouch, park it in the Bose, and carry uninterupted music anywhere on my property and even to our next door neighbors. I love this modern technology! A far cry from the old 8-track days!!(Original Review)My cousin had one of these at the beach recently. People kept walking up the beach to us wanting to know "where is that music coming from?? It sounds amazing and I don't see anything." He pulled up the small beach towel and the Bose was under it. They could not believe the quality of the music... even out in the wide open. How can such a small speaker make that much music? His answer was "I don't know ask BOSE"! I couldn't believe it either. I bought one as soon as I got home. I do not have an Ipod. I have a Creative Zen M. It sounds awesome. The Bose Sound Dock does not sound like a speaker in a plastic box. It has amazing, natural sound and the bass is incredible for such a small package. It will not vibrate your glass off the table but the lows are low & smooth enough to make you say WOW! I know the price hurts, but the pain goes away after 3 songs! Thank You Bose.... You have a new fan!!! I LOVE it!!

$review_text.: This is a very nice looking backpack
 It's very adult, and it doesn't look like we are borrowing a backpack from our teenaged son

 We both thought it was very comfortable while fully loaded.I love how many pockets it has, including protective sleeves for both a laptop and a tablet
 You can fit a LOT of books, notebooks etc in this bag and it stays secure and organized

 The material seems very durable, and I love the waterproof bottom.If I have to say something negative:  I think the passport pocket is really irresponsible


 If you travel out of the country, you know that keeping your passport secure is a top priority

 I would never, ever consider putting my passport, wallet or other important item in that little pocket
 It's way for easy for someone else to access

 I would love to see them put a similar little pocket on the side of the pack that faces your back, so that nobody can access it while you are wearing it.It would also be great if there was an interior hook for attaching a key chain or dongle.

$REVIEW.: I have had this Galaxy Tab 3 (8&#34;) for more than 9 months and it has become my primary entrance to email and WEB access


 The fact it instantly comes on makes it easy with Android notifications to respond to my outside world


 The lap top gets turned on only when I need to access a non-mobile WEB sites or special Windows applications

 Also, the installed Android Apps operate well in the Samsung environment, everything from calculators, music, YouTube, to shopping like Amazon work reliably as expected
 I really like the fixed position cancel, home and menu keys at the bottom
They are not part of the display in a known position no matter how the tablet is oriented
The only issue is the raised home button isn't as responsive as I would hope
 I don't know if that is hardware or software

 In most cases it works just fine.I added a 64GB SDHC card and have all my music, pictures, and quick reference Word & PDF documents instantly available
 I keep this tablet close to me all day
 One other thing, I rarely run out of battery power by the end of the day even though I use it almost constantly.

$review_text.: I did a lot of research before deciding on this particular cable. I purchased this for my girlfriend for Christmas so that she could hook her iPhone 4s up to her car's AUX port. She drives a 2008 Honda CR-V and I can vouch that it is perfectly compatible with this make and model of vehicle.The sound is just as excellent as in my car where I have a USB port connection from my stereo, which is what I was hoping for.I was very worried about the length of the cord since many reviewers stated that the AUX port and cigarette lighter port needed to be VERY close together.  On the CR-V, they are about 2 feet apart, with one being high up on the dashboard and the other near the floor. But this cord is a perfect fit. Each segment of the Y-shaped split (one for the car-charger part, one for the AUX part) is 1 foot long, and the other end of the cable is 2 feet long (where you plug it into your iPhone/iPod).  So the cable is a total of 4 feet if measured separately, including each of the Y strands, but is 3 feet long total if measuring from top to bottom as in the specs listed. If you think you need more length, there are 1 ft. and 3 ft. extensions available on Amazon as well. I had purchased a 1 ft. but didn't need it after all.The one downside is that the plug-in end for the phone is a bit larger than the regular iPhone/iPod charger that Apple makes. We each have a case on our iPhones. I have an Incipio case and this cable fits into my phone with case no problem. But my girlfriend has an Otterbox case and the plug is just a tiny bit too big for it, so she has to remove her case in order to plug it in. :(  It is upsetting but we are going to try and shave away some of her case or just order her a new one.I am still quite impressed with the quality and durability of this cable as compared to the others out there. This is the way to go if you have an AUX port in your car.
$SUMMARY.: Works perfectly, except one small problem...

$review_text.: I read all the early CES hands-on reviews and even though know one has reviewed this camera on Amazon I ordered the it
I needed a simple 'idiot-proof' camera when I am out on the town with my family and do not want to lug a full frame DSLR around


This is a review based on having played with the camera and all of it's settings for the last 4 hours

I shot about 100 pictures in various settings and even though I did not think the WiFi was something I cared about..

it has been a real pleasure to use

I've owned a few Samsung 'Point and Shoots' (PNS) in the past and the image quality is excellent..

this one is no exception
What I really wanted was a nice low-light camera and this model does it better than any I have tried in the last 2 years


I am an avid photographer and I shoot products images for a few companies and this camera could handle the task; which surprised me


First off it has many simple buttons that make it so easy to use that by image 50 I just turned on the AUTO button and it worked just as good as me manually setting the camera for the situation; that is what I wanted in a PNS
The WiFi was simple to use, just connect the cable to a PC and install the iLink software (built into the camera) and set it up for Auto-backup and it will download the software and connect to your router; meaning once you shoot it will Auto-Backup on the fly when you tell it to


No more pulling the SD card out and importing images

It also has a great on-board editing program along with a bunch of Instagram type filters if you want to look retro

I am very, very impressed by the low-light shooting and will update this review after a good week of use


But for now, this inexpensive Samsung is the one you want

I just put my Nikon Coolpix up for sale on Amazon and will fine tune this camera for my needs


In conclusion it is almost to idiot proof

The settings are so simple that anyone can take really nice photos


I have not tried the video yet, but when I do I will update the review.

Your Fire fits  quite snugly inside it - I dropped  mine accidentally and the Kindle did not fall out of the case and no harm came to my Kindle.  I love the elastic strap that keeps it closed while in my bag - and keeps the battery from discharging since this folio keeps your Kindle in sleep/wake mode.It is a bit awkward to type while  your Kindle is in  landscape mode in the folio or should I say awkward to type fast--not impossible -- just a bit awkward.Your Fire will easily slip from landscape mode to vertical with no problems.  The padding is nice and thick so I think you Kindle will be able to withstand quite a bit while in this folio.

$review_text.: Folks I have a HP Pavilion DV8-1100CTO the one with the 18" monitor and the Quad Processor.When my Original factory battery went dead after only two years of owning the laptop, I figured I would buy one of these knock offs from Amazon. With my original I would average around 3 hours with a mix of activity and inactivity (where the CPU and screen would go to sleep) Well with this Anker knock off I get around 2 hour and 18 minutes before I get the laptop warning message that I have 12% remaining and I should plug into an outlet.Update: Awesome customer service. Company sent me email and called to see what they can do to make sure that I was satisfied . They looked for a higher capacity battery for me, they offered to send me another battery to try, and they even offered me a full refund. It is so nice to see a company value their customers this way.They also explained that their battery is rated at 4400mah (which they list in the description) while my original HP battery was rated at 5200mah. So it's not like their quality is inferior because it is a knock off. It is just the capacity rating of the battery is different. Unfortunately they did not have a higher capacity battery to offer for my laptop. I might decide to send it back and will probably end up paying double for an original HP battery for that  extra 45 minutes or battery life.If you have a HP Pavilion DV8 and are okay with 4400mah or a little over 2 hour battery life, you are not going to find a better price or better customer service than this company. If you have an other laptop model they probably carry a higher capacity battery.I upped their rating from three stars to 4 stars!Update 7/7/2013:Battery sometimes holds only 10-15 minute charge; Battery meter shoes full; All of a sudden without warning computer goes black! 80% of time it holds a charge of 2 hours and other 20% 10-15 minutes then with no warning it goes black!I dropped my ranking to 1 star!
$review_summary.: Great customer service but product sucks!

When one of my APC UPS's needed a new battery, I decided to try the RBC5 from American Battery.I like that it has a sturdy label tag that makes installing and removing it much easier.One word of caution: The American Battery RBC5 is slightly larger than the APC RBC5.  It is about 1/16 of an inch bigger.  It was a very tight squeeze to slide it into my UPS.It has been powering one of my servers at home 24/7 for several weeks with no problems.

$REVIEW.: This is a feature packed camera, which works well with the "mydlink" cloud service. I liked the overall feature set, and found the annoyances bearable. However using the camera without the cloud (especially if you have real privacy concerns) is a real pain.First of all, the setup with the cloud is very straightforward. If you happen to have a d-link router with the same feature, it's done at the router. If not, you'll have to use a basic installer from mydlink site (the download is not available on the main dlink site, though). After that you'll be able to use the camera from your pc, or a mobile phone.The first thing you'll see a vary blurred image. I do not know why dlink did not have a reasonable default for home room sizes, or even have a infinite focus, but it's fixable. It took me a while to get it correct, though. The small notch around the lens is used for the focus (yes it's manual), and it took some effort (I was afraid of breaking it).After that the image is actually very good. Bundled with the infrared mode there is good enough result in both daylight, and nighttime. The camera can be tilted both manually, and also to "bookmarked" positions, and the night mode can also be automated, manual, or on a schedule. Also you get limited recording support.However the nice things end if you want to use the camera locally. Given that many online services had been hacked in the recent years, it might make sense to want to keep your camera private to your home network only. However the web interface of the camera is plain awful for this purpose. And the bundled software seems to come from windows 95 times -- it requires UAC, which an important security feature, to be off at all times. So basically this is a cloud based camera, and do not expect to use it properly without that enabled.Pros:- Easy network setup (+wps)- Pan and tilt- Good night mode- Easy cloud access (from phone, etc)Cons:- Manual focus!- Not so useful without the cloud
$SUMMARY.: Great cloud based camera, not so great for direct access

That should not be a problem with an iPad as long as it's in a backpack or briefcase.  I would not use this case if I needed to protect the device from bending.  My only complaint is that the price is high.. but approximately $38 is the going rate today for an INCASE iPad sleeve both online and in the Apple store.

$REVIEW.: I just have this gadget yesterday and my first impression with this camera is high. I bought this over SD700 mainly because it has image stabilizer, new DIGIC III processor, and wide angle lens. Build-in quality is decent, despite of plastic battery door that many other reviewer complaint, I found this is not a great deal. This camera made in Japan, so you can be sure the quality of this camera is strong.Picture was great. I try macro shot and the picture comes up better than my Nikon D50 camera. There are many other features like color swap, color accent, multi-shooting modes that you need to play with more to get familiar with this. I will give you more updates after downloading the pictures. Highly recommended!Updates 11/7/06I downloaded the pictures and it comes up beautiful, crisp, natural color. Didn't notice any corner softness.Stabilizer works great. Now I can take low-light photograph without worry of getting blurry pictures. Pictures without flash also come in great shape. For me just unbelievable! Macro shot also excellent. I can take very2 close pictures while my Nikon DSLR unable to focus within very close distance. One thing that I really enjoy is color accent feature. Just pick any color from your object: live! , and the camera will automatically select only the color you choose to be taken. Other than that, will be black & white. For example you want only flower shown in color on your picture. Or maybe you want to swap the color of your flower from red to yellow? isn't that cool? not to mention it has great movies features which allowing you to take high quality video at 30 fps!Other advanced features that you might be able to find only in proffesional camera also available such as:- Exposure Lock(AEL)- Flash Lock(FL)- Focus check modeI really recommend this camera for everyone. Even great backup for amateur/professional user.

$review_text.: I bought this to improve my system sound quality. I've read reviews stating that HM-101 was much better than standard sound cards. I had anothger problem: my motherboard sometimes generates noise.What I found out is that this unit also generates noise, just like my motherboard. Also, I compared carefully the quality of the sound, and couldn't decide it was better than the one I had, which is a standard Realtek ALC 1200 chip in ASUS P5Q3 motherboard (the typical cheap stuff from some years ago). To judge the sound I listened carefully to some favorite songs (flac format), with a very good Koss headphone).The good thing is that HM-101 installed automatically in my Windows 8 system, and started working right way. No additional settings. It's cheap, light, small and works. But don't expect much improvements, although many reviews elsewhere promise small miracles.

$review_text.: I have been using this mouse for about a month now and I'm sold.  There are many great design features that I've never seen before in a travel mouse (and I've had plenty believe me!):1. A really small USB transmitter -- most of my mouses have these long transmitters that stick out of the side of my laptop and just generally make a nuisance (and hazard) of themselves.  This one is so small that I just leave it in all the time.2. Touch activated -- all my other ones are optically activated, the touch activated has proven more reliable.  It always wakes right up, I don't have to burn my retinas all the time trying to figure out if the thing is turned on or what, why won't it wake up?  This is great for a mouse that only gets used for a few hours a day.3. It really does work on just about any surface -- but I still use a mouse pad most of the time.4. Compact size -- which is great for travel.5. Transmission works pretty much any location for the mouse -- my other ones would often freak out if the mouse was on the opposite side of the laptop, this one doesn't seem to care where it is relative to the dongle, it always works.6. They say that it has great battery life, so far so good -- I haven't replaced a battery yet.I do wish it had a little more ergonomic goodness going on, personally I like my hand to be tilted into more of a handshaking position.  That's a pretty minor complaint since this is, after all, meant to be a travel mouse and there aren't any travel mice with great ergonomics (I'm still hoping though!).Overall, I think this is the best travelling rodent that I have ever had.

$review_text.: Previously used one of these that my old roommate had. It is an amazing product but has its downsides that might out weigh the pros. The price for one is overpriced for what it needs to do. If you like the touch screen it works great allowing more devices then i could think of (control the xbox). The other thing is the lack of signal/reception. If the device isn't directly pointed that the receiver the device will not work but it will show on the screen that it did power on or power off the device. Sometimes it will power on the tv but not my receiver which is a little annoying.All in all Logitech makes one of the best products but I think I would rather save some money for a remote from Acoustic Research.

$REVIEW.: Okay, a lot of you are going to try out the U3 functionality of this drive, and I don't blame you.  For the same price as a regular 1GB drive, you get all this extra, cool stuff to try out.  I'll admit, that's why I got this drive.  Unfortunately, I found only one computer that the U3 software worked correctly on.  Most of the time it was a problem ejecting the drive when you're done.  It wouldn't eject properly, so I just removed it anyways and it made WinXP unstable afterwards, sometimes crashing.  I also don't really use the programs that are available for U3 drives anyways, so it seemed like a no brainer to remove this software.And in the end, that's what I recommend.  Get this drive with the U3 software on it, and see if it works for you.  If it doesn't, do a little looking around on the U3 site and download the uninstall file remove it all from your drive, basically turning it into a normal flash drive.  That way you can at least say you tried to make it work, and I can see how some people would really enjoy the possibilities of what this drive can offer.  For me, however, the cons outweighed the pros and I uninstalled the U3 software, turning it into any other 1GB flash drive that you can get for the same price.  No harm, no foul.

$review_text.: This is one of those product that gets a big thumbs up!  I like things are simple, effective, and won't break the bank.It worked fine on a new Canon SL1, even with a screen protector already on the touchscreen! (I know -what was I thinking?)  But it works great!  The magnetic attachment is ingenious and allows the eyepiece and cup to be quickly attached and unattached without much fuss.  It also has a nice neck-strap to keep always handy.  (It can be easily detached, if not need --nice touch.)The magnification is perfect for manual focusing when shooting video, and almost essential when shooting with a short depth of field.  (Fortunately, Canons like the SL1 has a 5x and 10x magnification in LiveView which make this practical.)Important note: this unit does NOT have a diopter, however there is a cheap and easy fix!  READ ON:If your eyes are less than perfect (like mine) and you have trouble focusing through the eyepiece, you have two choices. (1) get a similar eyepiece with a diopter that costs several hundred dollars, or (2) spend a $1.50 a get a nice pair of reading glass (1.50, for example) and use these with the eyepiece.  Works great!

$review_text.: Let me first say that I've been a Canon fanboy and still am
However, they really fell down on this one


I have had many many Canon cameras
Almost a fetish really

Currently I have a 940IS, an SD4500, an S95 and a couple dSLRs


I don't expect a single camera to do everything well, which is why I have so many
Well, that and the aforementioned fetish.PROS:10X zoom lensSolid qualityNice screenPretty good video, even in low lightPretty decent pictures in low light, very good in good lightGood macrosGreat pictures with a flashDedicated video buttonEasy to reach, well positioned controlsCONS:Absolutely horrendous battery lifeslowww 10X zoom lenslittle big and heavyBattery door right next to tripod mountFocus huntingHard to use scroll wheelDid I mention the horrible battery life?If you've spent any time researching this camera, you know it performs pretty well, including picture and movie quality, especially in low light


Not fabulous, but pretty well considering the 3.4 aperture lens


In the right lighting this camera takes great pictures and if your subject is not moving much and you have a few seconds set-up time, you can take great pictures with the zoom

Let's face it, the zoom and the price is why you bought this camera, right? It's why I did.But now let's skip the accolades I covered in the PROS and get right to the dirty
The zoom is slow, plain and simple


If you can capture anything but a non-moving target when zoomed in, it will be because that target is cooperating and there are no time limitations

If you plan on trying to snap some pics of your daughter playing soccer or your dog having a ball in the park, forget it


You're going to be much better served with a super zoom or a dSLR


Canon tries here but fails in my opinion

The lens WILL however allow you to frame longer distance stills that you couldn't do without cropping.Movie performance is very good combined with the zoom
Just last night I filmed portions of my son's music concert in a dark auditorium
The movies came out great although the sound recording leaves something to be desired

You may want to buy a stand alone sound recorder and combine them using software on your computer for optimum quality
BUT, and here's the huge BUT (not butt), the battery life makes this a giant pain and is why I now plan on selling the camera


I got maybe 12-13 minutes of recording out of one fully charged battery


Then I had to remove my monopod from the tripod thread to replace the battery, rethread, power up and then get another maybe 12-14 minutes of video
I had to switch to my S95 to record the rest (30 mins) of the concert, which it did on a partially used battery and still had life left

I couldn't zoom in as much though


The battery life and the hassle of swapping in time sensitive situations is the HUGE deal breaker in my opinion.Why make a camera that is supposed to be able to take great pics in most situations, near and far, and do 1080p video (only 24fps by the way) only to severely hobble it with a very weak battery? Why!Just to quickly cover the rest of my CONS, which would not be deal breakers in and amongst themselves

The camera is pretty big for a compact, which it really has to be for the wide screen LCD and the big lens
I actually like the feel of it, especially ergonomically, but be aware that if you are looking for a cam to slip into your front pants pocket or tuck away in a purse, this may not be the right one for you

Especially when you figure in the charger and/or the 3-4 extra batteries you have to carry..


 The scroll wheel is a little hard to get a grip on, especially with dry hands, which in the NE means about 8 months out of the year


This camera hunts a bit focusing, even in bright light when zoomed in

And I already mentioned the battery door right next to the tripod mount


Since you have to swap batteries often, you know what that means.SUMMARY:If you can accept the limitations of this camera, then it is a good deal


Especially after the price drops
But if you want a really compact cam, this isn't it

And if you do anything more than snap a few shots here and there and take a 2-3 minute video now and again, this camera will drive you bonkers trying to keep it fed with power

What could have really been a do all/be all camera fails hugely with the lack of a quality battery
Since they obviously weren't trying to make the most compact camera in their line, it is inexcusable


Sorry Canon, but I'm no fan of this one.Lastly, if you can forego the zoom and can pony up the extra cash, buy the S95 (skip the S100, it has issues)
The quality and value in that little camera will astound you
As close to a dSLR picture in a mini-cam as you can get at the moment


Just terrific, especially in low light with its 2.0 aperture lens.

$REVIEW.: The BlueRigger HDMI cables with the braided sheath offer a tremendous value. I used two of the 3' cables to connect two devices (Blu-Ray player and Apple TV) to a Kinivo HDMI switch with no noticeable degradation to the picture and sound quality on my 55" TV. The cables, especially in the 3' length, are a little stiff and want to maintain large-radius curves when routed between components, but that is really only an issue with a small, lightweight components like the HDMI switch and Apple TV; even so, I was able to get the cable to cooperate so that I could situate the components just where I wanted them. The only way I could see improving these cables would be to put locking connectors on them (they popped out a couple of times when I was trying to get the components in place), but at the price I paid for them, I can't complain about anything.

$REVIEW.: Most IR emitters are basically nothing but one infrared LED inside each of the small stick-on plastic housings, all wired in parallel into the plug. But there are significant differences in how these LEDs are oriented:The original emitters that came with my IR extender have a little hole in the double-sided tape and the LED faces out the back of the plastic housing through that hole. Therefore, if you stick the emitter directly over the IR detector of your device, the LED will shine right at it and it will get the strongest possible signal. This makes it a little harder to install them right initially, as you have to get them aligned pretty well with the receiver. But once that's done, the system works really reliably and you can probably add a lot more emitters to the same receiver as you get a strong enough signal, even if the receiver doesn't quite provide enough power to drive all LEDs at their maximum brightness.These emitters here, on the other hand, have the LED facing out the SIDE of the plastic housing, opposite of where the cable is attached. So, if you were to stick this thing onto your equipment, the light will shine ALONG the unit rather than towards it. If you are lucky, the light gets deflected by the plastic in the housing of the emitter and the plastic cover on the receiver on your unit just enough to give it a strong enough signal, but in general, I would consider this design MUCH worse, and it doesn't work nearly as reliably as my original emitters in our setup. The best way to use these would probably be to stick them not on the equipment but onto the shelf in front of it with the cable coming towards you (away from the equipment). But you'd have to have enough of a gap between the emitter and your device, so that the light can &#34;make it up to the receiver&#34;. Which means you'd probably have to push your device deeper into your media closed by several inches.BTW: The reason why the double sided tape on these is probably not as strong as in some other ones is because they chose one that is thin enough to be transparent, to allow the IR signal through it. My package came with 3 replacement &#34;stickers&#34;, so the manufacturer seems to be aware of the problem and is trying to help out.

I bought this mount for a Samsung 46" LED TV, and as usual, it was just as advertised.  The mounting template simplifies the job, and the box includes bolts and screws for just about any installation.  Customer service is extremely helpful, and willing to answer your installation questions.  The cable management channels in the arms of this mount make for a nice clean install.  You can adjust the mount in several ways to suit your needs.  There are cheaper brands out there, but nothing compares to the quality and strength of OmniMount products.  You spend a lot of money on a nice TV, so spend a few extra bucks on a decent mount.

$REVIEW.: So, I've never owned a stylus before, prefering to use my finger on the touch screen of the kindle fire or kindle touch (got both). However, upon receiving this product I will say that I am sold on using it. It has a definite "feel" that you have to get used to but once you do, you are no longer smuding the screen with oils from your hands. A positive there. It also serves nicely as a high quality pen. I rarely replace the insides of a pen but I probably will with this one. I think the price of about $20 is a bit steep for this product and I would rave over it if it were only $10. Anywho... this is one fine pen/stylus combo and if you're willing to shell out the $20 for it then I highly recommend it.

Or anything else that carries the Samsung brand.My rating would be negative stars if allowed.As the title says, this device has been screwed up for 75 days - since 9/30/13 and Samsung's firmware update. Still can't turn it off, and it still won't RUN key apps such as banking bill pay and others.Samsung and its proxies have been totally out of touch with reality on this horrible mess. They should be paying us $20 a day for holding on to what's an essentially useless product. Customer service is beyond useless. "Sorry for the inconvenience" - I've heard that far too often. Next time, I'll buy an Apple. For now our cheap Acer laptop will do. It is running just fine.*****It's now been a month since the Samsung/Android firmware update and there's still no fix from the supplier. Still have to go through the plug it in to shut it off rigamarole, and many of our must-used apps don't work. After reading reviews of the new iPad Air, i know what i will be buying instead of another Samsung.*****Update: It has now been two weeks + since we updated firmware. The device has not worked properly since that day, and is nearly non-functional.Samsung rep says there is no way to back up to previously firmware version. And Samsung/Google are working "as fast as we can because we know a lot of people are upset." No s__t! You can see how hot customers are by checking the various forums.I cannot believe that a manufacturer and its software collaborator - Google/Android - would release an update so fraught with bugs and errors.Learned my lesson: iPad will replace this POS!*****We bought this device in hopes that it would replace our old Dell desktop. Not so fast, bucko.While it's handy to use sitting on a couch, and acts much like my (now broken) Samsung Galaxy S3 phone did, the tablet apps aren't nearly as intuitive. And we have never gotten it to connect to our wireless printer (we did make the connection with my MacBook and iPhone). So, it doesn't work to print selected emails as intended.Android recently dropped a software "upgrade" on it. The device has since become almost totally non-functional. To turn it off, we need to plug in the charger and hold the power key down for about a minute. On top of that, our banking app, YouTube and a few other oft-used apps have stopped working. I deleted them from the device and attempted to download new versions, but couldn't connect. No more billpay off the tablet. Called Samsung tech support but they were unable to help.So, I have bought an inexpensive laptop computer I hope will last 3 years or so.So, anyone want to buy a used Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 wi-fi? Cheap?

Just make sure to bring along a second set if you're going to really go flash happy.I mark my batteries with a sharpie pen so I can ensure that groups of batteries get same level of wear.

No matter how carefully you try to protect the plastic, any attempt to dust or clean the bezel results in fine scratches and eventually a white haze
What's worse, any lights in the room catch the hazy scratches and cause horrible, glaring reflections


I called Samsung technical support twice about this problem, and all they said was "we don't warrant against physical damage."It's a shame, because the quality of the picture is very good

But you can't watch the picture because your view is contantly distracted by the glare from the bezel.My advice is to spend your money on an LCD with a more traditional metal or solid black frame.

That feature alone adds so much value to the game. I have yet to try out everything about the game, but it has been a blast so far. I have hosted two parties over these past two weeks and everyone had so much fun playing this game. We played on party mode. All of the different challenges are fun, though each of us has our own favorites. I have also done workout mode during my free time. That was very fun and provided a decent workout, but obviously, this game is not designed to be a strict fitness game so don't expect it to do wonders on every muscle.I love this game. It definitely brightens up the party and gets even the shy people trying it out. It's also fun on your own if you just feel like getting off your butt and learning a dance routine. Some of the moves can be a bit redundant, but I'm on the beginner level so that is expected. I will update as I advance. I recommend it to everyone. It's fun and gets your heart rate up.

$review_text.: There are going to be a lot of reviews about these headphones, in both magazines and here on Amazon, that use audiophilesque (I know, not a word, but bear with me) terms like "warmth" and "muddiness"

 Terms that generally speak to the clarity and integrity of the original recordings as heard over a specific piece of equipment, or combination of electronics


 In this case, when someone talks about the headphones being "muddy," what they're pointing out is that, to their ear, music played through these phones ends up somewhat distorted due to an excessive base response with the 'finer' notes of music running together sloppily as a result


 There will be, absolutely, and with good reason, a lot of people asking whether or not such a high price tag is worth a set of headphones, no matter how good they may sound.I open, addressing other reviews, because these are all sound and valid, but very subjective and personal points
 The Monster Beats by Dr
Dre headphones are "warm", or "boomy", or even "muddy" -- but that's by design


 Make no mistake, these headphones have been designed with an urban purpose in mind


 Where the outstanding noise cancellation technology contained within will drown out the harsh sounds of city life as one takes the subway to work, walks down a street filled with cars and construction, or in Lebron's case, walks into a hostile arena with friendly and non-friendly fans screaming for his attention
 Where the person whose head and ears are so comfortably ensconced can trade the chaotic din of life, for the rich and even immersive experience Beats offers


 These phones have been designed with hip hop in mind, which is to say that this "muddy" quality in a range that serves to actually enhance, not detract, from beat-heavy music, and no apologies are made about that given the name, and the endorser behind them who played such a direct and critical role in their development.Are these phones for those who only listen to music with strong backing beats, like hip hop, and certain 'areas' of rock and industrial music?  Absolutely not, they simply excel within
 Beats perform brilliantly no matter the fare, it's just a matter of understanding purpose and intention.Which is why I recommend hearing a pair before buying
 If you're looking for a set of noise-canceling phones through which you can quietly relax to Mozart, I still think you're going to be very impressed, but maybe you'll find them too "warm" for your taste and the cost
 That's a big maybe, and why a review like this is so difficult

 We each hear a little differently, we each value experience and sensation differently, so as much as I can (and would) rant and rave about these headphones, and swear that they're worth every penny of their suggested retail price, the truth is that your mileage may vary.As for the reality of my own experience and perspective; these are now the best headphones I've ever owned, and I listen to a very wide spectrum of music genres


 The audio quality (discussed in better detail above) is worthy of any superlatives thrown at it


 The comfort is outstanding
 The build quality is top notch

 The battery powered noise cancellation technology is wonderful


 Little touches like being able to temporarily mute audio by pressing a discrete button on the side of one phone (the stylized 'b' logo) is brilliant


 The extra cable to turn Beats into a completely functional and very high quality two-way headset for the iphone was a masterful touch
 Even the packaging all of it comes in was masterfully designed, with great emphasis placed on both form and function -- an area of product design often overlooked, but greatly appreciated (even if just unconsciously) when done well.These are, without question, absolute top-of-the-line headphones, and while they may have been engineered to bring out the best in beats, they provide an outstanding experience all-around, making them (in the eyes and ears of this reviewer) worth every penny to those who value music.


$SUMMARY.: The best thing you can do is find a store where you can hear these for yourself before buying.

$review_text.: EC Technology Dual USB Output 16,800 mAh Battery Charger / B00CAMCCLQI was very excited to receive this battery charger free of charge from the manufacturer for review.  I have anAnker SlimTalk 3200mAh Battery Charger, which is slender and great for keeping my phone alive during the day, but even it can't keep my phone charged for more than one day, which is a problem for long trips. This EC TECHNOLOGY charger is a lifesaver, though I do want to note that it has a couple of quirks to be aware of.1: Size. This is a pretty big charger. You wouldn't want to put it in most purses, though it would be at home in a large laptop bag or roomy day-bag. Check the product dimensions before you order and make sure that your use-case for this backup can withstand the extra weight. I think it's a good size for a travel charger, but your mileage will vary.2: Power Button. The one thing I don't really care for about this battery is that it's not "plug-and-go", you actually have to press a power button after you hook up your phone/tablet but before the battery will start charging it. (The button is easy to press with the ball of your finger.) If you're used to plug-and-charge batteries, this can take some getting used to; one time I plugged in my phone and grabbed it before heading out only to realize that I'd forgotten to turn the battery on and my phone was near-dead.3: Overcharging. The other quirk is that the battery turns itself OFF when the phones/tablets attached to it are fully charged. Now, I get that overcharging a device is a concern for certain situations, but if you have a device that draws a lot of charge while idle (which my older model phone does), then this means that an overnight charge on this battery will go like this: your phone will charge up to 100% at or around midnight, the battery will switch off, and then your phone will seep charge for the rest of the night and you'll wake up to a dead phone. Mmph. This is why I say I wouldn't use this charger for overnight charges -- unless your device doesn't pull a lot of idle charge or if you've switched it off ahead of time.4: Dual Output. This battery charges two devices via USB. There's an "output 1" and an "output 2" slot, and one time it seemed like the Output 2 slot wasn't working unless the Output 1 had something charging on it. That seemed like a very strange design decision, though, so I tried it again later and it was fine. I'm 99% sure that the problem in that case was that I hadn't plugged the cord into my device firmly enough, so once again the larger point here is to MAKE SURE your device is charging before you walk away. (See point #2.) Obviously this is true for any battery backup device.5: Display. The visual display is great in that it tells you (a) that the battery charger is on and charging and (b) precisely how much charge is left (not in 0/25/50/75/100 increments like my Ankar does, but rather in actual "79%" numbers), but it's also fairly bright. If you flip the battery over onto its front, there isn't much light-seepage.6: Performance. I'm actually really impressed with the speed of charge on this battery. My benchmark tool for these things is the Kairosoft games on the Google Market -- I love them, but they suck the battery dry like an expensive vacuum cleaner. I've found that I can plug my Samsung Skyrocket phone into the charger while it plays audio non-stop and plug my Samsung Note 8.0 into the charger while it plays a Kairosoft game, and the charger will still manage to (barely) keep up and keep inching both devices towards a net positive charge gain. That's a REALLY impressive charging speed, given that I've actually seen a Kariosoft game drain one of my devices while on a wall plug before. Of course, if you want a faster charge-up on this (or any) battery backup, the best thing to do is stop using your device, but it's nice to know that you still can if you need/want to.7: Storage. The sheer amount of charge in this device is also impressive -- I've had my phone on the charger with non-stop audio going for 8+ hours, and the tablet with a game going for 4-5 hours throughout that, and STILL have not seen the charger dip below 60%. I think I could probably get two full days of heavy use (or three days of light use) on this without charging the battery, but haven't had a chance to test that yet.8: Accessories. Final point, this battery backup comes with its own cord and a variety of plug-heads to swap out. I've only used it with USB-to-microUSB devices (and the battery itself charges via USB-to-microUSB into a USB wall plug we've installed in our home), but it's nice to have the heads to swap out if anyone drops by with an iPhone in dire need of charging.Bottom-line, this is a great travel charger once you get the hang of using it, if you don't mind the added weight, and if you can either turn your phone off at night or have some other solution for night-charging (or if your phone idles extremely efficiently). I highly recommend it and I'm glad that I had the opportunity to review it.NOTE: This review is based on a free review copy of this product.~ Ana Mardoll

While the card itself may function great, it is certainly not a low profile card, and requires a full size slot, which are not available in my small form factor computer.I'm not sure why that it is called Low Profile, then!  Perhaps "Low Profile Ready" is the key, here, but there were no half-size brackets, nor would the card have worked with one.  More a review on the manufacturer's labeling, than anything else.  Even a sticker on the box says it's Low Profile.

These clearly gives the Beats headphones a run for their money while being, in essence, comparatively cheap in price but not in quality and performance.Kudos to Sony, I'm positively glad I decided on going with these pair of earbuds.

$REVIEW.: I just picked this up at Fry's for only $69 today.  I honestly don't need another headphone but hey it has an EQ controller! LOL!  This headphone is heavy and it feels sturdy.  It comes with two AAA batteries, one audio jack, one four feet long extension cord, three manuals, one cleaning cloth, and a bag to hold the headphone.  See below for my findings:1.  The ohm issue is a non-issue.  I compared connecting the headphone to a receiver vs an iPhone 5.  They sound the same.  Obviously, the receiver has more sound controls than a smart phone.2.  Although the headphone is relatively heavy, it feels fine even after wearing it for over 90 minutes.3.  Sounds great with classical music.  Sonatas with Richter and Oleg Kagan CD was my first test CD and Mozart piano concertos by Vestic Chamber Orchestra was my second test CD.4.  Generally, rock music sounds good.  Various Now CD's were tested.5.  Does not give enough bass when rap songs were tested.  This included 15 Years on Death Row CDs.  For this very reason, one star got deducted.I like this headphone for $69.  I wouldn't pay more for it because the Grado Prestige Series SR80i Stereo Headphone still sounds better at $99 a pop.

$REVIEW.: If you have a bunch of old FireWire 400 peripherals and your new computer only has FireWire 800 ports, or you want to daisy-chain some FireWire 400 and 800 devices, you've know the pain of "I can't plug this into that." You can go out and buy a bunch of 400 to 800 cables, hoping you get the right length, or you can replace all your FireWire 400 devices, or -- for a very low price -- you can simply get this adapter.Don't worry about replacing cables. Don't worry about replacing devices. Use what you have, and connect everything together using this simple adapter. It won't double the speed of your FireWire 400 devices, but it will allow everything to talk. I wonder if there is an adapter we could use for Congress...?

$REVIEW.: I got this TV a couple years ago
 I'd looked at it in the store, and I thought the picture was OK for what I was willing to spend
 In addition, I have a 1080P Mistubishi, and 3 other 720P TV's in the house (I know - that's a sad commentary on our way of life ...) and this unit has the best picture of the 720P units (the others being a 40" Sharp a 32" Insignia and a 32" Dynex)

 Most of our TV viewing is either DirecTV or DVD's


 The Samsung's picture is not quite as good as the 1080P Mistubishi, but its a close second and much better than the others


 For the money, this Samsung was a very good buy.

$REVIEW.: I have had this for a little over 2 years and I have had zero problems with it. It has been rock solid and has had continuous up time of over 6 months only being interrupted by power outages. I don't have a UPS connected to it but I should. Needless to say it has recovered from power outages every time with no issues.I had two 2 TB drives in it configured in raid 1 which mirrors both drives. Now I am out of space so I added 2 more 2 TB drives and am currently in the process of changing the raid to RAID 10. In order to do that you need to delete your current raid and create a new raid which means you need to have another copy of your data because all is lost when you delete a raid. So far all is good. I will update if that changes.I have heard horror stories of people loosing data and I really feel bad for those people but Ill state the obvious which is nothing new, you should have a back up other than this NAS. I use this NAS in a home network so all computers use the same network drives. All files, videos and pictures are in one location. Then I back this up to the AMAZON Glacier cloud.This beats the brains out of USB hard drives. They are not even in the same class. USB drives are convenient and useful but are not a replacement for this in my opinion.

$REVIEW.: I just had to try it out immediately after getting it, so I attached it to my new Vizio TV that arrived the same day.  Get this, I tried a channel scan with the antenna sitting on the back of the couch and got over 100 channels. Oh Boy! I thought I'm cancelling the Cable tomorrow!  Unfortunately, just like Cable, there is a lot of pure junk and useless (to me) stuff streaming over the airwaves. After deleting the Spanish, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Hebrew, Russian, Religious (in all the aforementioned languages), Infomercials, kid shows, et al., I was left with around 20 usable stations including all the major Networks.  Most had great reception with no pixelation.  Mind you I'm located 50 miles from the transmitters, and the antenna was on the back of the couch in an almost horizontal position!Next I chose a mounting location in the spare bedroom.  The cathedral ceiling is approx 11 feet high and I chose to put the antenna around 6" or so below the peak.  I cut a piece of scrap 3/4 inch thick plywood into a 3.5" x 3.5" square, drilled 4 pilot holes to match those on the antenna, drilled 2 larger counter-sunk holes, for mounting the block to the to the wall,  sprayed the block and the heads of 4 sheet metal screws with gray primer to approximately match the antenna, once dry attached the wood block to the wall using heavy duty drywall anchor screws (lite to medium duty would likely work based on the light weight of the antenna, but better safe than sorry :) ), then attached the antenna to the block of wood with the sheet metal screws into the pre-drilled pilot holes from above.  I then routed the cable through the wall for a clean install look, but I could just have easily used standard cable clips on the wall to get it to the TV.Then tested it out.  The channels that were pixelating with the antenna on the couch, no longer were, the new scan had 125 channels, but only 26 that I will watch (see above). I'm still blown away by the quality of an over the air picture in HD.  Wow, what a great picture and product!

$REVIEW.: I've had the NSLU2 for about a month. The first thing I did was to upgrade the firmware, which ended up being more painful than I thought... After downloading the latest firmware and starting the upgrade, the NSLU2 got stuck into a state where it said that the upgrade was in progress and I couldn't reboot. Stayed like this overnight. In the morning, I called LinkSys support. I happen not to have any PC's at home, only Macs, and LinkSys phone line doesn't  support Macs. Doh. Anyway, they told me to reset and try again. It worked.Other than that the device is working as expected. I plugged a Seagate Barracuda 200G using an external USB enclosure, no issues at all.The documentation is a bit terse w.r.t accounts and groups. I'm a bit annoyed about the "guest" account having access to the main shared partition. It doesn't seem to fit my home usage at all, where I want the main partition to be mountable by all authenticated users belonging to a certain group (e.g. my family)  , "guest" *not* included.Finally, a tip: if you're going to use "rsync" to backup files from a desktop/laptop onto an SMB partition mounted from the NSUL2, you might want to use the "-modify-window" option of rsync. Without it, I found that rsync would copy files over and over again.

It was okay, but the DVP5140 was 1/4 the height and weight of the Jaton and handled all he discs that the Jaton was refusing to play.The only things the Jaton does that the DVP5140 does not offer are forward & back single-frame crawl and picture zoom, but we have not missed them.We just bought the updated version of the DVP5140 (the DVP3680) as a replacement, and it's even smaller

$review_text.: I purchased this for my Sprint Mogul.  It holds the device very securely, but when the flexible arm is in a curved position from my windshield, it has some "play" in it that causes the PDA to vibrate when going down the highway.  If the arm is straight, without curves, it doesn't seem to have the "play" in it.  I returned the first one to Amazon for replacement.  The second one they sent me was far worse...wish I'd have kept the original.  It is acceptable, just annoying to have to put my hand on it to read it when driving.  I didn't try the vent mount.

$review_text.: This ballhead arrived quickly from seller, was packed well, and arrived safely. I've had a chance to use it for a few days now, and although I've never used tripods with quality head before, I must say that this ballhead is rock solid- I'm using a Canon 1dx along with a Sigma 50-500 OS lens which is fairly large and heavy (4 lbs or so I beleive for hte lens and another 4 or so lbs for camera I beleive) the ballhead holds the setup rock steady in both the conventional ballhead position and in the gimbal position. Using the ballhead in the gimbal position, with hte base of ballhead loose to vert horizontal panning, and the collar o nthe lens loose to allow portrait or landscape shooting, and the ballhead snugged to allow gimbal to move and stay put when letting go, this gives me a very nice range of motion for most positions. I'm using htis on a Vanguard tripod, and have had a chance to try the tilting center column on the tripod, and I must say, it held the semi heavy setup nicely, and will allow me to get the camera into positions not doable with standard tripods and ballheads- it seems to be a very versatile setup.It's goign to take me awhile to get used to the knobs, and I'll have to be careful for awhile as I have loosened the quick plate release a couple of times by accident, but that is user error- but personakly, I think I might have preferred the lever quick plate release for this reason- so that there woudl be no confusion while reachign for knobs blindly while looking through viewfinder.The knobs have a nice softish rubber feel to them, very comfortable to work with, and it only takes a slight tightenign to get the camera rock solid- no need to really try to crank the knobs- although you do have to apply more tightening when the ballhead is at an angle - but it's not too much more-The gimbal is fantastic, and along with hte lens rotation ring, it's probably the position I'll mostly be using as I find it easier to get the camera to just the right position without having to wrestle with the tensioning to get that 'just right' tension when in the ballhead's conventional position- the gonbal just makes it much easier in my opinion.The only issue is that the quick release plate screw seems to work loose, and you must carry the supplied Allen Wrench to tighten the screw- the screw also is only holding the plate to the camera by 1 and 1/4 turns, so not many threads are holdign the plate to the camera- I don't feel that this is a very secure connection, and allows the screw to work loose it seems- I've had to really use a lot of force to tighten the screw, but don't want to have to do this as it may strip the threads in the camera base, and if that happens, I'm not sure it coudl be fixed? If anyone has a solution to more securely attach the quick plate to camera, I'd appreciate hearing about it.Over all, the ballhead is a solid, well made product- it operates very smoothly, and hte best thing is the gimbal position in my opinion- it makes the ballhead very versatile I think- but will be less versatile though when using a lens without a rotating ring- although if you don't mind uing somethign liek an L bracket and havign to connect/disconnect when switchign from landscape to portrait, it will work ok for those lenses too- although usually when I'm out in the field, I need to very quickly go from portrait to landscape- but when using hte Acratech with a lens that has rotation ring, and using it in gimbal position, it's abotu as versatile a setup as you can get I think- Very pleased that I went with hte Acratech

$REVIEW.: Adds on to your DSLR for those difficult shots, zoom functions to help you take photos in live mode vertically.You get a regular battery tray (powered by 2 alkaline cells) apart from the camera battery tray (for holding 2 camera batteries) in case if u run out of power!The remaining buttons are there to manage your LCD functions (which are not much)- Did not receive the coin battery mentioned in the description- Did not receive the IR remote mentioned in the description(Will check with the seller about the same)However i did notice that this grip will drain your camera batteries if not used for few days, which is like a turn down for me. I don't if other users faced the same issue.Edit--Received the coin battery and ir remote promptly after followup. So thumbs up for the service from the seller. However i did not find the remote very useful as it literally does not have any good range for usage, u need to be very near the sensor receiver to trigger the click. Overall good service but a little better than an average product.

$review_text.: Pros: Full function Win 8.1 PC. After 4 weeks of intense investigation, the Venue 11 appears to be capable of everything a desktop with a comparable processor can do. Extra inch of screen width makes surfing easier. Solid build. No glitches. Good battery life. Best tablet in this size class that I've seen. HDMI, microSD, flash, 100% full software compatibility. Use desktop version or app, your choice. Beats iPad to death.Cons: Extra wide screen makes hand held use awkward: hard to balance.Personal observation: Using stylus/finger is a pain in the butt compared to a travel sized wireless mouse. Everybody I know with a large tablet of any make wound up getting a keyboard to go with.  My conclusion is that a larger tablet is not as usable as a lightweight ultrabook. Given a second chance, I'd get a high-end small laptop with a fold-back keyboard.Update 3/27/14: Just as happy with this tablet. Performance is flawless, so far. No issues. I read that stylus users are unhappy, I wouldn't know. At home, I use an HP bluetooth mouse and a Lenovo bluetooth keyboard, both picked up at deep discounts(total $32), and both work perfectly with the Venue.

$review_text.: UPDATE (12/10/2011): I have just connected the Samsung wireless adapter that I purchased (from another vendor, alas) for a mere $50
It hooked-up instantly, no hassles! And, holy smokes, even with a so-so wireless connection (which is what we have in our living room where the TV is) the adapter immediately a) found the network, b) connected! and c) streams movies off of Netflix and any other online service like silk! This may permanently put Blockbuster out of business

If I could give this TV ten stars, I would!! Couldn't be any happier with it.2nd UPDATE (12/27/2011): In spite of the comments of some other reviewers, I have found the SOUND on this Samsung set to be absolutely 1st rate! I did hook it (for fun) to our stereo system, for additional speakers, but found it to be completely unnecessary


In fact, I now use our Samsung TV to play Pandora radio (which is avail


for FREE via internet) in our living room, and the sound is superb

(Albeit I'm not a fussy audiophile, just a guy who likes music.) Btw, this is truly a "Smart" TV: we have total internet connectivity; you can connect almost any device to it; I even hooked my older notebook PC (via SVA patch cable) to the TV, and it worked flawlessly! Using my notebook PC and the internet connection, we turned the TV into a giant 55" karaoke machine! Good cheesy family fun! I have seen the future, and it is this TV
There's very little it can't do


You'll never leave your house...and that may not be a good thing

Enjoy!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------I'll second (or third) the five-star reviews here

We just purchased this set, our first foray into plasma/lcd/led land, and we're thrilled with it! Btw, for the uninitiated (as we were), both in terms of price and I'd say picture quality, it goes: plasma (great picture, much cheaper); lcd (a bit more expensive, also a great picture); led (a bit more expensive yet, phenomenal super-crisp picture)
Some will say, plasma gives you a more "authentic" color-saturated picture -- but if you're putting it in a room with a lot of windows, it's a glass screen so reflections can become a problem

LCD/LEDs are a lot less reflective

We loved the picture quality (and frankly the energy-efficiency) of the LED


Btw, plasmas can get very hot, much like old-fashioned CRT TV's (with bulky picture tubes), maybe even hotter


Go to an electronics store and touch the screens: plasmas - hot, lcd/led - cool.But as far as picture quality on this Samsung: out of this world!! Truly like a home theater

And, yes, as one reviewer noted, shutting-off the Auto Motion feature (or whatever it is) noticeably softens the picture


If anything, the Samsung LED picture is perhaps too crisp for some viewers, but it can be easily adjusted


The remote is just fine, and the on-screen interfaces seem extremely easy and user-friendly


Even this big 55" model I set-up on my own in about 30-40 minutes

I'll put it this way, if you can set up your home computer (like plug in the monitor & keyboard) you can do this; if you're technologically-challenged, or don't want to wrestle with a large (amazingly lightweight!) TV, then get help


But the assembly & installation is easy.I won't get into all the tech details, as I'm still learning about the set, but the back-panel has ample connectivity

I hooked-up a cheapie Blu-Ray DVD player (also a great Black Friday deal) via the HDMI connection and I was BLOWN-AWAY by the quality of the picture!!Bottom-line, almost any size Samsung LED (even LCD I suspect) is a great purchase


We looked at all the competitors in this price-range (the lower-end of the LED's) and settled, very happily (so far), on Samsung

Btw, don't know what you'll be using this TV for, but this "base" model seems to have more than enough bells & whistles for movies, cable, gaming, etc


You WILL have to by a wireless adapter (for about $50 - $75) if you want to use the networking/wireless capability


This set is wireless-capable, but the wireless adapter is NOT included.All around, a great purchase! VERY, very happy with it...so far.Samsung UN55D6000 55-Inch 1080p 120Hz LED HDTV (Black)

$review_text.: This webcam is all I expected from the product description and more

Video and Audio quality are stunning! when I used this to chat with one of my sisters she was amazed by the picture quality and accuracy, after she was used to her laptop's default webcam that delivers poor quality on both things, she actually asked me for the model and brand to get one


Of course, as with may of these HD recording devices, lighting is a critical factor in delivering quality picture, low light will have the video quality suffer and vice versa, nothing new again but worth mentioning.Installation could not be easier, I plugged this into a laptop running on windows XP and it was immediately recognized and I could start using it on Windows Live MSN


It is small and very practical to carry
The fact that it can be folded is amazing as you can carry it without worrying it may be damaged as the folding actually covers the lens (I added some photos to the product description) Additionally, it can be rotated 360 which allows you to capture different directions and angles.The software included allows you to do many other things besides simply recording videos and managing your library

You can share videos and pictures directly to Facebook, YouTube and twitter, which is as easy as one click after you configure the respective accounts

Additionally you can use avatars (such as Martians and animals), add effects (B&W;, old film, bubble, etc) and use masks in your videos (you can actually have the Mona Lisa talking) Some of these may not sound practical as you read them but they are fun to use if used creatively, I can tell you my sister and I had a fun time testing these and playing with them (pictures added)If you are intending to get this as a basic webcam to be used only for instant messaging this may not be for you as you would not be using it on its full potential
If you are into recording videos, editing (the software included has a link to Windows Movie Maker for you to work on your videos) this is definitely worth the price


Not only delivers high quality audio and video but offers a lot of additional features you may definitely want to use!

$review_text.: I received my Kindle Fire 7" as a Christmas present. I was a reluctant recipient because I imagined I would prefer the look and feel of real books. I was surprised to find that reading at night, the little screen aglow, is actually quite pleasant. The ability to download books on whim can be addicting. Movies are playable, with excellent image quality, though ultimately your'e still staring at a screen the size of your hand and hearing a soundtrack with analogous auditory constraints. My main gripe: I bought the "Kindle Edition" of a book with "enhanced content" (i.e., embedded videos) that will not play on the Kindle. Apparently, Kindle enhanced versions are for iPads. Another problem has been connecting to my house Wi-Fi. My computer and cell phone have no problems, but the Kindle repeatedly drops the connection. This typically -- but not always -- happens when the Kindle has been idle for a few minutes -- like, you make a trek to the refrigerator. On your return, no Wi-Fi. If you check the settings page, it says that it's connected, but actually it isn't. You have to shut the Kindle down and reboot. Most of the time that works. On occasion, however, you have to reboot several times, and this tends to shrivel the enjoyment. Apart from these glitches, I have been pleasantly surprised. Maybe when hand-held holography becomes available I won't wait so long to give it a try.

$REVIEW.: I have had this up and running for 1 week now, backing up 2 windows computers, 2 macbook pro computers (w/time machine), and using as iTunes and dlna media server. Happy with results. Have 2 ST3000DM001 (seagate 3tb drive) also ordered from Amazon. So far no issues at all with the drives. Kind of wondering if this all is too good to be true because everything just worked right out of the box. When you put the drives into the Diskstation 212j and turn on power and install the OS (DSM) it formats the drives automatically to it's own file system type called ext4. Amazed at how fast it was to format 2 3-terabyte drives.The DSM operating system makes the experience. It gives you a lot of status information and there are add-ons you can download and install. I figured out how to have a home intranet running on Wordpress (install-able option).All I wanted was a good quality disk backup option for my macs and PCs in the home and got a lot more. There are a lot of configurable options on the DS212j but you don't have to do all of them to enjoy what it does simply, store data.Link to the Seagate drives. I did a lot of research on which drives to pair with the DS212j and many reported good results with Seagate in general, and also Seagate's quality is better now than Western Digital. Also, I have just had too many problems on my own with WD drives in the last 8 years (caviar, raptor, failures after 3-6 months, etc.) and wanted to give Seagate a chance. Here's hoping they last for longer than 6 months...Seagate Barracuda 7200 3 TB 7200RPM SATA 6 Gb/s NCQ 64MB Cache 3.5-Inch Internal Bare Drive ST3000DM001

The built in subwoofer add just the right amount of bump to movies or music

 Don't expect room shattering bass from it but yes it adds the perfect amount of depth and i was surprised how much bass comes out this little guy.The only thing I would have changed would be that it sticks so far out when wall mounted
 But since It has a built in subwoofer it doesn't bother me that much.Have it hooked up to my 60&#34; Vizio Smart TV via the optical connection.I highly recommend this item!

$REVIEW.: This HD is awesome.  I was going to get the Intel 530, but there are too many reports of firmware issues involving rebooting the PC.  I decided to go with the top name in consumer SSDs and I couldn't be happier.  Well, if it was a little cheaper, I could be.Anyone who is considering an SSD should research the difference between TLC and MLC.  The Samsung 840 Evo is TLC while this Pro drive is MLC.  MLC is better and will last longer.

$REVIEW.: This Belkin folio is excellent and just what I needed to protect my kindle fire, its just big enough to extend beyond the edges of the fire itself but small enough to where I can still hold the fire in one hand with the flap open.  It is well made unlike most of the marware line so I know it will last a while, It also stands up reasonably well to view streaming content without holding it.  Definitely worth the price I paid for it and will be getting the purple one soon enough as my wife now wants a Kindle fire!

$review_text.: As the majority of the reviews state, this is a good bag for what it is - an inexpensive basic option to hold/carry very expensive toys.The medium bag's dimentions (10 5/8 x 6 3/4 x 7 1/12) are fairly even with other camera and video bags.  The outside seems like it's fairly padded, however upon looking on the inside it seems on the thin side (the lining especially seems like it will rip easily).  I use this as a camera bag, and if I have my lens attached to the camera body, there is major uneven weight distribution (I feel better adding extra padding when I do this).  The zipper to the main compartment seems sturdy, but the side zippers leave the tiniest opening when closed (so watch out for this).As another reviewer so adequately wrote, this really DOES look like a lunchbox I once owned!  But that's a good thing, as it definitely deters against theft.  In regard to 'roominess', I can indeed fit the camera body, extra battery, extra memory card, strap, and two lenses.  However, that's pretty much ALL I can fit - can't stuff in the battery charger and extra hoods, lenses, etc. as well.  Good extra or daytrip or transitional bag, but definitely meets basic camera-organization needs only.

$REVIEW.: Are you someone who is considering buying one of these? Don't necessarily believe all the negative reviews here. It seems many of these people have an ax to grind with Apple, didn't buy this item, and don't want it. That's fine - there are many MP3 players and ipods to meet various needs, but many are slamming the new shuffle just because it doesn't do what they want it to do. Keep in mind that it was created to hold 1000 songs in an incredibly small device. A thin piece of metal smaller than your thumb with 4GB storage is unheard of and amazing. That's the main purpose here and some concessions have been made to allow this - obviously there is no display and, for the first time, the controls are on the headphones instead of the device. The controls, although a little high on the headphones, are easy to use and after just a little use become intuitive. The big issue is whether you like the generic headphones that come with this ipod. Millions of people have no problem with these headphones so if you are one of that group you are fine. One alternative, if you like in-ear headphones, is Apple's $79.00 phones - they sound great compared even to more expensive earphones and stay in during exercise. The other option is to wait for the inevitable slew of adaptors that will be coming out. If you're offended by these options then you are out of luck and can post your 1-Star review here along with the others. Headphone and control issues aside there is only good to report. The voiceover feature is incredibly useful. Even though you know your own music sometimes you don't want to wait even a few seconds to identify a song. Plus you can now use this feature to access different playlists on your shuffle, something you couldn't do with the previous 2 models. All of this adds up to a tiny, surprisingly functional thing of beauty. Some things have been lost to accommodate this but the negativity in some reviews is over the top. If you want a higher level in a bigger package the Nano is available. But, for what you are getting, the new Shuffle is certainly a great product.

$review_text.: I paid 4x the price of this for a similar setup about 6 years ago - got to love the price trend! This is a well constructed device with all the components one needs in a single package. Very convenient. I have noticed that one needs to be fairly straight on tho the sensor for it to receive the signal (about 15-20 degrees angle is the maximum). A minor inconvenience in my case but worth a star. The older, expensive unit seems to take the signal from almost anywhere in the room. I recommend it as a cost effective and convenient solution.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this LaCie drive specifically as insurance, to put Leopard's Time Machine to use.  Within a few minutes, I had everything unpackaged, set up, and doing my first backup.  The quad interface might be overkill in my case (I'm using the FireWire-800 on a new iMac), but there is another computer in the house on which I might need to use the FireWire-400, should I ever get around to it.Some other reviewers have complained about excessive noise, but everyone's tolerance level is different.  My old computer was easily several magnitudes louder than this, although I must admit that the LaCie is the loudest thing on the desktop (the iMac is extremely quiet).If you're interested in Time Machine numbers: I have about 46GB of spaced used on my main drive; I am on the computer every single day, mostly for e-mail, music, browsing, and documents (including some work in a VMWare Fusion virtual installation of Windows); and after about a month, there is about 85GB of spaced used on the LaCie for Time Machine backups.  At this rate, I ought to be able to have at least a year's worth of backups before Time Machine will begin automatically deleting the oldest items.

$REVIEW.: This is such a great keyboard

The keys register after a little bit pushed down, and while this takes some time to take full advantage of, once you do it will make typing so much faster and easier


The USB and headphone, microphone ports are useful too, however you need to make sure the ports are near each other on your computer as the braided cable can't go too far
Also, it's worth noting that the USB ports aren't for USB power (ie

charging things or running power intensive things like external HDDs) but will handle flash drives easily


The board is a bit heavy but feels solidly built and the programming software (downloaded free from their site) works great with the keyboard.

$REVIEW.: This lens is okay. Has good image quality and looks good through the range, My only gripe is it feels like the cheapest lens I own. It's plastic and feels like plastic. The zoom is also kind of sticky and is a little noisy for my taste. The auto focus is fine. It's audible, but about the same as the 55-250mm in terms of volume. I'd much rather own the 17-55, but at a 3rd of the cost this is still a great value. You can't expect perfection in this price range of lenses after all.

$review_text.: I bought mine for a new job where I have to lug a heavy standard 16&#34; laptop back and forth


It has enough room for the laptop, shoes, lunch, notebook, pen, standard folding headphones, keys and tiny headset

On occasion I can also stuff in small things from home that I want to take to work.It has very well thought out compartments

There is a small pouch at the top of the bag that is perfect for keys and my tiny phone earpiece

There are two large unstructured compartments in the main interior with a partition


One side is for the laptop and the other is pretty big

Then there is a smaller zippered compartment with lots of pockets for power block, mouse, notebook, pen, cards etc
There are two fully zippered &#34;water&#34; pockets on either side

The last thing I want to do is add more weight by carrying water around


I put my lunch in the left one and my big noise-cancelling headphones on the right

When the bag is on my lap it is very quick to take the headphones in and out of the right-hand pocket.The only negative, and I'm not sure any other bag would be different, is that it does hurt my back after awhile

It's well-padded so I don't mean things are digging in

It's just the sheer weight of what I carry and the distance I walk every day
Have not experimented with adjusting straps yet b/c they seemed OK out of the package
The ends of the straps come rolled up so they are neat and out of the way.

Once you hear non-commercial radio with a great selection of stations, there is no going back.  Taking long drives is great since there is no station fade out.  I got this Delphi reciever free for my car during a recent XM promotion for an additional subscription (discounted).  This Delphi was easy to install and works perfect.

$REVIEW.: Please don't take the Amazon star rating too serious - every lens has its pros and cons that I wouldn't want to squeeze into a single one-dimensional figure...A quick note about me: I have been into SLR cameras and lenses for more than 20 years - as a hobby in the beginning and professionally later. Maybe because of my technical background I started testing my own lenses quite a while ago. I have a (no longer so) little test lab of my own where I do 6 different image quality tests (after taking a lens out for a while).The EF 28mm f/2.8 IS USM is a compact and well-built prime lens with a common wide-angle focal length, a good maximum aperture and a modern image stabilizer that compensates up to 4 f-stops. While the image stabilizer sounds great one has to consider that it's not as necessary in wide-angle lenses as it is in telephoto lenses - but I still appreciate it. The lens is best used indoors or for architecture and landscape photography. When using the lens with an APS-C camera the resulting effective focal length of 45mm is close to a standard / normal lens and thus can be used for a whole variety of things.The lens offers good image quality - sharpness is great straight from f/2.8 and there is only a small amount of barrel distortion visible. My lab tests have shown that color fringes ("Chromatic Aberrations") both in focused parts of the image ("Transverse CA") and in out-of-focus areas ("Axial CA") are visible but compared with its immediate peers the lens's performance is quite respectable. There is no curvature of the focal plane ("Field Curvature") but corner shadows ("Vignetting") are very intense and they are visible even stopped-down.The EF 28mm f/2.8 IS USM is similarly priced to theEF 24mm f/2.8 IS USMbut costs a lot more than theEF 28mm f/1.8 USMwhich offers an even better maximum aperture (which is great for available light photography) but lacks an image stabilizer and cannot compete with the EF 28mm f/2.8 IS USM's good image quality.Chances are you already own a zoom lens covering the same focal length in which case you are probably most interested in the EF 28mm f/2.8 IS USM for its good image quality, compact size and the maximum aperture of f/2.8.Is this lens for you? I think it really depends on how you configure your kit. If you have use for the focal length / aperture combination the EF 28mm f/2.8 IS USM's rugged build quality and good image quality will leave no regrets.A much more detailed review of this lens together with all test shots, sample images and technical data is available on my website LensTests_com.

Right now I have the transmitter and receiver about 10 feet way from each other with no issues, no static, and negligible delay.  I chose these over the "Rocketfish", because reviewers of that product complained about they after about a year.  Hopefully the Soundcast holds up for a while longer.  I do really appreciate not having the wires running under my carpet/along the baseboard.**UPDATE**I've had these for a few months now.  I'm starting to get a little bit of feedback every once in a while.  Sometimes the connection will drop out for a few seconds, then come back automatically.  A few times, when it cuts out I get a loud "POP".  I've checked all the wires and I don't have any shorts or crossed connections (i.e., the exposed part of a positive wire touching a negative one).I will continue to update if I have anymore problems.

$review_text.: There were a couple of bad reviews


I am assuming that they were early in the product release cycle.This product is not super huge, but not probably travel size if you are a road warrior


I will say that it charge devices FAST!I nightly charge my iPad Retina, iPhone 5, iPod, and my Nintendo 3DS
Even if you want to just come home and top them off for a charge, they are done before you know it.Seriously, I can't imagine what else you would need from it
Being able to charge multiple devices fast and the flexibility of being able to swap cables and charge a different device is amazing.I wish I would have found this sooner

It makes my bedside stand look clean

It is heavy enough not to slide off the desk as well
Not having a LED to show it is working is a double edged sword


If it did more than likely I would be covering it up as they keep you awake shinning on the ceiling
But not having the LED just means I pay attention when plugging the cables in to see if the device indicates charging.Like I said, this device is awesome

Glad they worked all the bugs out.- Damon Downing

$review_text.: The Satechi transmitter works fine from some of the tests I was able to do. The receiver that mounts on the hot shoe sits loose and falls off from my 5D mark2 camera if the camera has a small tilt. I wish it had a metal insert over the plastic receiver to stabilize it well, other than that it remains to be seen once the weather improves and I can take it out and shoot further.

$review_text.: This thing, combined with a GoPro and a gimbal mount, produces astonishingly professional video. It's dead-simple to fly and you rapidly become adept at aiming the camera.I'm writing this review to warn of a poor design decision, however. The 'turn me off' sequence (both sticks in at a downward angle) takes effect even if the craft is in the air. I accidentally triggered it while attempting to maneuver at 200 feet. The resulting unpowered fall destroyed my Phantom.This is not a one star review, because it was my fault. It's not a five star review, because the system should never have allowed me to do that.

$review_text.: Thule has been long known for their ruggedness so when I saw a chance to snag this MacBook Pro Sleeve for my husband (who just happens to be an IT professional and drags his laptop EVERYWHERE) I just couldn't resist
He is rough on his equipment and it tends to get tough on our pocket book


(if you know what I mean) So I handed it over and told him to test it out.After a few weeks of use, this is what he had to say.Pros:*It's rugged.*The zippers (though they are a little stiff to deal with at first especially around corners) create a very tight seal keeping the elements (rain etc) out

 A must if you are using this as your main carry all
 Don't plan on throwing it into a backpack? No problem.*The texture (or ridges) on the outside make it easily to handle

 While most cases are smooth on the outside (and can slide from your fingers if you aren't paying attention to what you are doing) the texture on this sleeve provides a space for your fingers to actually latch on.*The polyester fiber lining on the inside is top notch
I don't have to worry about my MacBook getting scratched, which makes me a happy camper.*The elastic bands (on the inside) bend with the display allowing me to use my computer while it's still in the sleeve.Cons:*The zippers


I mentioned this in the pros but man...those are some tough zippers to get around the edges
I'm sure with more use they will looses up a tad, but they are difficult to deal with right out of the gate.*While I appreciate the texture found on the outside (allowing me to grip it easily) I could benefit from a handle

Once the computer is tucked safely inside it tends to get a little heavy (due in part to the heavy duty material used to make it.)*Unless you are taking this backpacking (which might actually be the reason you are buying such a tough sleeve) there is no additional space provided for accessories of any kind
(aka you can't bring your charger.)This is - flat out - a backpackers sleeve


If you are looking for a new business case you will be disappointed
And, with the lack of features (which would allow it to be functional for more than 1 "type" of use) it's a tad pricey.

$REVIEW.: Other iPad keyboards have made sacrifices, both in size and combination of keys that are different from your usual full size keyboard.  This one does not make such sacrifices.  While the keyboard is not full size, it is large enough that you can get into the normal flow of typing.  The iPad fits snugly and I do not have any worry that it may fall out.  The only thing I have found challenging is using it in your lap...it really does need a hard, flat surface for the back stand to hold.  But that's a minor quibble; I do feel almost as productive on this keyboard as I do at my laptop.

$review_text.: I purchased 2 of these.  One for our DirecTV DVR, which got so hot in a cabinet, it melted the veener off the shelf.  The other was for for my laptop.  The unit for the DVR is working fine, however, it is noticibly noisy.  You can hear the fan even over the hard drive in the DVR unit.  Also, when it is dark in the room, you can see the blue glow of the LED.On the laptop unit, it remains in a fixed location on a credenza.  Again, the fan is noisy enough, you have to turn up the TV or music to hear and the blue light is distracting as it shines out into the room.  In addition after owning this unit for about 9 months, the USB power cable has become frayed at the connector and now the unit no longer works.  I'm not sure how it would take heavy use if this unit is already dead after 9 months with very light use.Overall, I would not purchase these notebook coolers again.  It is probably worth a few extra dollars to get a version with a quieter fan and the ability to turn the LED light off.  The units have not lived up to my expectations for an Antec product.  I have purchase PC cases, power supplies and other Antec accessories and have been very pleased, but these do not.**Update 11-11-2010**  Second unit died today.  Fan started making a loud noise and just quit.  This is the second of two I had ordered and now neither is working.  Not impressed considering the quality of products I wouild expect from Antec.  My first 2 computer builds were with an Antec case, power supply and fans.  Both rocked, these coolers are just disappointments.

$REVIEW.: I recently purchased these screen protectors for an iPhone 5.  Performs just as stated, no glare in any kind of light, and we've yet to produce a finger print.  I mean, yes, if you eat buffalo wings then try to touch, it'll probably create a smudge... but that is to be expected and if it didn't create a smudge I'd suspect black-magic and burn the screen protector at the stake.The anti-glare/anti-fingerprint surface provides a unique side-effect in its design that I find particularly nice; a lightly textured surface.  This really sells it for me.  Think of emery board, dull it up a bit, and it feels kind of like that.  Why do I like this?  Simple, I can feel just how far my finger/thumb is moving, where most give no tactile feedback.  Lets face it, we all enjoy that.  How many times have you shut the forcefeed back (haptic/hapticons) off to save battery life, and it just felt awkward (&#34;did I click that?&#34;)?  That's because we used to and enjoy the tactic feedback.This order came with a 3-pack and lifetime warranty.  I'm sure it's not indestructible, but I do not foresee having to replace this one like I did the last (cat scratched it; the brand Best Buy carries for like 30 bucks/protector).  I also have a Galaxy S3 with a glossy protector (came with my UAC case).  I plan on replacing it with this version Tech Armor for the S3 as well.Only slightly negative thing I can say about this is it does have an effect on clarity *every so slightly*.  They do admit that you should get the HD version if you want *the best* clarity.  Here's the catch-22 though... are you so clean and careful with your phone that you won't get fingerprints on a gloss screen protector?  Further, if you're watching netflix on your phone (or alike), you are probably in an environment where there is glare (not at home, where you have a nice TV you would be using instead).Bottom-line+Anti-Fingerprint Works+Anti-Glare Works+Slightly textured surface for tactile feedback.-Does have slight effect on clarity, but to the extent that a gloss protector would only be better in a static environment (without glare), and you handle it with cotton gloves (no smudges/fingerprints).  Take one of those away, and this screen will win in clarity over a gloss &#34;HD&#34; one.

$REVIEW.: I got this for use with my N90s, and it does everything I wanted it to, and then some


I honestly just wanted a remote trigger, but this was cheap enough that I decided to give it a shot


Its not really built like a tank or anything, but clearly the product has been thought out and its a pleasure to use


the main release button has a nice feel to it, and the half-press to focus works great.The intervalometer works as advertised and is pretty intuitive to set up, plus the backlight is a great touch


Despite the intervalometer always being on (no power switch), I haven't had any problems with batteries.Overall, it does its job, and I'm glad I saved the money over the "original" product for something else.

$REVIEW.: This motherboard came with everything I was looking for (1394, parallel port [internal connector only], tons of USB ports, ethernet [only 1], PCI slots, etc).  I've had no problems, but I'm not overclocking.  Received revision 1.1 from Amazon.  The BIOS does seem to select slower timings by default, for example it selected 3GHz for a 3.16GHz Core2 Duo processor and more lax memory timings than printed on the DDR3 modules, but it was easy enough to bump them up to spec'd speeds using Setup.  The provided software CD installed all necessary Windows software automatically, and Fedora 10 also works flawlessly.  Power consumption is also MUCH lower than the previous (Pentium 4) motherboard it replaced so I can operate the fans more quietly.Just a reminder, it's a MUST to keep yourself grounded when handling to prevent ESD!

$review_text.: I was a little skeptical about this but after reading a bunch decided to try it.  It arrived quickly and intact.  After installation I fired it up and found the sound to be fine for general use.  The main reason I got it was to use the SD slot for my personal music.  I loaded up an old card I had laying around with mp3's and popped it in.  It automatically saw the card, found the music and started playing it.  It has been working perfectly since.  It also charges my phone via the USB jack and even sees the music files on it!  The clock was a nightmare to set and I abandoned using it.  EQ is rudimentary but can be tweaked at least close to what you want to hear.

$REVIEW.: Excellent for my light weight Vixia Camcorder, this handle/tripod does the trick.  I was skeptical because of the price, but it helped me hild the camera steady for taking movies.  The little tripod it opens into is cute and it adds minimal weight to my camera bag.  I wouldn't reccomend it for a heavy and expensive DSLR, but it's great for a small light camcoder.

$review_text.: Easily the best bang for you buck at the moment. The 660s aren't quite good enough for the money, the 680's are $100 or more pricier for only a very small default increase in performance (an overclocked 670 can easily beat a stock 680), and you could afford two of these for the price of a 690 or a titan. The only reason to get a titan is if you have either very limited space, and the only reason to do a 690 is for quad SLI.For anywhere from a bit under $400 up to a lot under $400 depending on where you but this, it is easily the best price for the performance you get when going with NVidia. Obviously its debatable when comparing to AMD, but I haven't have good driver experience with AMD, so I generally stay clear of them.When comparing this particular 670 to some of the others, I personally picked this one because of the great things I heard about the cooling that it has, and when looking at it, you'll know what I mean. Those three fans keep it a lot cooler than the EVGA one, and despite being slightly lower clocked by default than some of the others, it can keep up and do so at lower temps.Be aware, that this is a really big card. I have the NZXT Phantom 410 case, which has a fair amount of clearance, and this card fits, but you probably couldn't fit the optional fan that the case allows for that's attached to the HDD bays. So just make sure that this card will fit in your case before you buy it.Also to note, that this card does really good SLI scaling. It pretty much doubles the performance with most games, whereas with a lot of other cards, you get diminishing returns by doing SLI.

$REVIEW.: These headphones are awesome, they look good so wearing them out and about is an option, the cords a bit long but honestly that just makes it easier when your on a stationary device like a computer. The sound on these is great, but when it comes to bass it does lack a little bit in the noise level, but the quality of the sound it has is perfect. The Soul by ludacris, or the beats even for example have waaay higher bass level, you can highten the lows on your equalizer to the top with those without a "crackle" sound when theres high bass. But they lack in sound quality, the bass gets louder and the headphones vibrate more, but that's it...with the HD 439's however, it is quite the opposite effect. While you can't raise the power of the bass on your device too too much before these start doing an annoying crackling effect, you can keep it at a decent level, but what makes them different is the quality of the low's and the bass. Its deeper, richer, and smoothed, not to mention the mids and highs are pretty even too, so they do very well for other styles of music. But honestly if your only listen to hip hop, pop, rap or some of that dubstep garbage, then do yourself a favor and get some in ear headphones, sennheiser provides some good ones ( 300's are great) but if you want something simple get Xtreme Xplosive's (although since the chord is red, you'll notice that they make idiots think their beats).

$REVIEW.: Now why do I have to rate how much fun this was?  Well anyway, I picked this up for my PS2 after getting an HD LCD TV.  Composite video looked like garbage so I needed something.  This outputs 480i resolution nicely, sorry I can't say anything about 1080 or even 720, but I lack anything that even outputs that.From what I have seen, these cables work with the PS3 as well, but at that point you should probably be using an HDMI connection anyway.  For the low price, I can't argue.  Quality is worlds better than what I had before and I would recommend this to every PS2 owner who owns a decent TV.

$REVIEW.: I mainly purchased this converter box based on the positive reviews listed about it. But when I received the converter box and hooked it up to my tv I found it got less channels (only 4!) than my present converter box (20 or more)I already had and thought was malfunctioned. I reconnected my other converter box to the tv and put this one back in the box. I can't return it to Amazon b/c I purchased it with the $40 coupon. What a big waste of money!!! I hope this helps someone else not to make the same mistake I did. Positive reviews can be misleading sometimes. I would have given this product less than one star if it was possible. Oh, yes, the remote is light and flimsy-feels very cheap! I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!I compared the Zinwell ZAT-970A advertised photo to what I received over 3 yrs ago and the features including the remotes don't match at all. Although, the converter box I received does have the model number 970A. But the color & style is totally different and the one I have is very small-gray & white design???

$REVIEW.: I have owned a Creative ZEN Micro for a few years, but it was getting full and the earphone jack was no longer functional. I wanted to stick with Creative because I have always found their products to be pretty sound and went with this item.When I received it, I figured I'd check for software/firmware updates. Since I hadn't done anything with it yet, I decided to update the firmware. Probably a bad idea (caveat: since I never used it before the update, I don't know if this caused my problem). Now it freezes constantly to the point that I carry a paper clip with it just so I can reset it. Oddly, the freezing only happens when using earphones. When plugged into my PC with the USB cable, I never have an issue. I bought this thing back in Feb.I am either sending it back to Amazon or doing an RMA with Creative for this (not sure which). I ordered a new one from Amazon as well and I may just leave the bad one at work where I often use it just via USB cable connected to my PC.I like the unit alot, so I am willing to give a new one a try, without doing any updates. I bought one for my wife and she has no problems at all, and she never did any updates (and now is afraid to because of my issues).I also don't like how it imports CD's - for example mix CD's I have burned at home. It seems to sort these by artist, but I prefer by album. I have actually found a way to work around this, though a bit cumbersome.Anyway, It's a pretty solid unit from a company who makes pretty decent products. If my new one doesn't work, I'll find a another brand.

$REVIEW.: I've tried several different type of cable organizers, including this one for my Sony ear buds for my Classic iPod.  I have a great storage/transport case for the iPod that has a hard case with mesh pockets inside on both sides - one for the iPod and one for the earbuds. But it's been messy with the earbud cord getting tangled when stuffing it in and later removing it from the mesh pocket. There are other things that work, but I love this Belkin iPod Earbud Clip Cable Management (Black) case. It's essentially a small, oblong "turtle" case, that easily flips open allowing you to wind/unwind the earbud cord and then flips closed. I've even done it in the dark! You can wrap the cord up entirely with only the earbuds and the plug-in showing, or adjust it to different lengths. It just depends upon how much cord you wind and unwind. It hasn't seemed to crimp the cord in any way and it's ultra easy to use. I can put it in the larger iPod case and easily insert or remove it from the mesh storage area. Or, if you just want to carry it around with a skin/shade, the earbud case works great and allows you to easily manage cord length. Worth every penny. Wouldn't do for larger, thicker cords but for earbud cords, this is GREAT! Best I've seen and a very reasonable price. Delivered as promised with free shipping.

$REVIEW.: Lens caps, while having great motives, are a pain to deal with for professionals. They're easy to loose, annoying to juggle and add time in the middle of a shoot.I basically use filters as disposable protection for my lenses. While I generally really like Hoya products, the UV (0) filter was giving me really weird, green ghosting around light sources. I know the green comes from the multi-coatings, but it was a common issue I was dealing with and it was really ruining some shots.This filter is perfectly clear, has no negative effects and is reasonably priced. It protects my 50mm and I'm happy!

I will still receive a little picture break-up on rare occasions, but 98% of the time, I am receiving a "free" High Def signal which is clearer than when I paid for Cable or satellite


Consider a HD TIVO unit as a compliment


I have been very happy with mine.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this for use in aSony NEX-7camera that can rapidly fill a memory device: it's full resolution RAW+jpg still images approach 30 MB. I rarely shoot RAW images, but always shoot at the best available .jpg quality, which ends up around 6 MB per image on the NEX-7.Shooting at this resolution, this card will store over 1700 still images. Alternatively, it will record up to 172 minutes of .mp4 video (10801) or 127 minutes of AVCHD video).Many current Sony products (including the NEX-7) will also accommodate SD media cards, so unless your capture devices are all Sony, you might not need the Sony proprietary form factor.

$REVIEW.: I have the Chromecast, Roku 3, WD live, 360, and PS3


 Needless to say they each have there positives and flaws


The chromecast is nice because of it portability
However, the app selection are limited
 I was mainly using it it for HBOgo untii Prime add the shows
 Comcast does not allow Roku access to HBOgo, but they do on the Chromecast


I have  not  tried all the other apps, so cannot comment on them


 Hbogo has frozen on my phone Note 3 while it is streaming to the Chromecas
 The movie/show will play just fine except if I stop it

Then I have to go through my phone apps again


The nice thing is it will pick up where it left off
 As to the picture, it is great

 For the price, it is definitely worth it


 I would recommend that when you use it, you keep  your phone/tablet on the charger.If I had to  recommend a product for just streaming netflix, amazon, etc..


I would recommend the Chromecast over the Roku 3 based on price alone
 However, I do use my Roku 3 more, because I had  it first and because of  the remote


 If I did not get my Roku 3 for next to nothing, I would  be using the Chromecast.

$review_text.: I've been using the vertical mouse for well over 2 years now.When I first got the Version 1 mouse, I had a problem knocking it off my keyboard tray as one other user wrote on CNET. This is just because I wasn't used to the height of the vertical mouse compared to a normal mouse. It didn't take long to train myself to pick my hand up higher off the tray when swinging my arm from the keyboard to the mouse.Ever since using the vertical mouse, I no longer have forearm pain.The optical scroll wheel in the vertical mouse 2 is a great improvement over the old version 1 vertical mouse. However, I liked the rubber grips on the old version 1 mouse better. Just as the first mouse took me a while to get used to, I suppose I will eventually get used to this one too.The only thing I still don't understand: Why didn't they design the original mouse this way?I'll never go back to a standard mouse as long as I can get a vertical mouse.

$review_text.: I bought this tv because of CR's positive ratings of LG tv's and their price/value.  I cannot write a very detailed description, because I haven't had this tv for very long and didn't figure out how to try its many features.  To be sure, this is a great tv with a great picture.  The 'tweaking'  suggestions detailed by other reviewers is helpful for finding the best picture settings.For my limited level of experience with newer A/V technology, I found the lack of a detailed manual to be frustrating, and the onscreen programming features aren't as convenient and intuitive as I would like.  Yes, there's a cd with the manual on it, but my computer is nowhere near the tv, so that's not a convenient option for me.  Rather than spend the time to figure it out, I'm returning it because Amazon didn't even respond to my price-match inquiry.  Be aware, if you are hoping for a price-match, Amazon won't even let you submit your request until AFTER the product has been shipped.  I also suspect that the 'see the price in your cart' (meaning you have to log in first), gives Amazon the chance to know who you are & your customer history, so that the prices you see are tailored accordingly.  Just something I wonder about, based upon my personal observations.Otherwise, I have had good experience with Amazon products, quick shipping and customer service.  The tv delivery guy was very prompt, professional and helpful.  I appreciate Amazon's free shipping and free 30-day return policy on televisions, as it is, truly, hassle-free.  All you have to do is arrange a time for delivery and/or pick-up.  Hopefully my refund will be prompt, too.

$REVIEW.: I recently purchased this lens along with the 24-105mm as a part of the fall cash in with cannon rebate program.  So, originally, my main reason to get this lens was because it would save me another $50 off of the other lens via doubling the rebates and make it pretty cheap.  But now that I have used it for awhile, I am really happy that I got it.  The 1.8 maximum aperture does two things really well, lets you take low-light handheld shots and isolates the subject.  See my example photos for examples of both of these features.  I use this on the Canon Rebel XT and Rebel XTi which have a 1.6X crop factor and make this lens more like a 135mm which is good and bad depending on your usage.  This lens produces very sharp results and doesn't weigh much, so it is easy to carry around.  If you already have a good range of zoom lenses and are looking for something that will just take really nice, sharp, handheld shots, consider this lens.

$review_text.: Let's face it: if you are a professional photographer, chances are you are using high-end Zeiss, Nikon, or Canon lenses that cost four times as much as this lens, and weigh at least three to five times as much. But if you are like me, an amateur/semi-pro photographer using an alpha system who wants a walk-around lens that hits all the major marks, its probably going to be hard to beat this Sony/Carl Zeiss lens.What's to like about this lens? Here's my highlights list:1. Rich, deep color images that can be amazing (just as you expect from all Zeiss lenses) - color is substantively different from non-Zeiss equivalent lenses2. Good build quality for its price range (no, it's not like the Zeiss 24-70, which costs twice as much and weighs twice as much, as well)3. Good weight to size ratio (its perfectly comfortable for all-day use)4. Good zoom quality, starting at a respectably wide 24mm and all the way to 120mm (5X zoom)5. Reasonable price for a Zeiss lens6. Comes with a very high quality leather-like bag7. Each item supposedly individually reviewed and signed off by a QA personThe lens is great to use. It's zoom ring is smooth and fast. Build quality seems very good for its price range, and it shows in daily use. (I have yet to see any zoom creep in my unit.) The images the lens can pop out can be just stunning: rich depth of color with great depth of field. (If you have experience with the venerable Sony DSC-R1, a camera I used for five years, you'll be familiar with the types of images that can be created.) The T* Zeiss coating probably has something to do with that, but its also the design of the lens assembly itself that yields these kinds of results. When you look at it is a package, its just simply a great system for a budding photographer, or even for those more experienced just wanting to work with a reasonably priced Zeiss lens.There are some drawbacks, of course. For less money, you can get the very well reviewed Sony 18-250mm lens, so its not always an easy choice to spend more money and get a reduced range. The lens does not use the high-end SSM focusing mechanism (but the truth is, most do not; it is generally only the high-end lenses that use this advanced system). The aperture opens only to 3.5 on the wide end, a disappointment, no doubt, but consider the cost and weight required to make lenses of this type open to 2.8.In all, this is a great lens that I don't hesitate to recommend. It could easily be your one-lens solution for general photography. Pair it with one of the inexpensive macro lenses Sony now makes, and you've got a great start for your alpha based system.---Late 2012 Update:I've just purchased a second copy of this lens, and this copy seems to be working just great. Assembly seems solid (still made in Japan), and the zoom feels smooth and snug. The photos look great. They can be surprisingly sharp for a zoom lens, but perhaps equal to its very strong technical performance of the lens, I must say that, more than that, this lens is all about color. The words that comes to mind are "luscious," "glossy," "saturated," "rich." It's a Zeiss world out there, at least it will be when you shoot with this lens. You can post-process digital images from any lens to simulate most any color cast and curve, but this lens simply knocks out images with the most saturated "Zeiss" color, perhaps even more than the venerable DSC-R1.Yes, the price has gone up painfully in the past year (its now up to $1,000 when not on sale), but there may be some sales on the unit at various points, and it is nevertheless by far the least expensive Zeiss lens for the alpha system available today. It is not manufactured with the same type of construction as the upper-end Zeiss lenses that run at around $2,000, but construction seems very solid, and, as I say, the lens is still one of those increasingly rare models that continue to be manufactured in Japan (and comes with a hand signed QA slip from the factory). The images that are produced sometimes are shockingly good. Let's not be overly gushy about this, but I must admit that shots with this lens can simply just look stunning. A little post processing is probably always necessary for any digital image, but the clarity and "presence" of the images can be outstanding.I still would have to recommend this lens to anyone shooting with the alpha system, as long as you can work within the 16-80mm range and don't need anything with an aperture greater than F3.5. And, one final thing that sometimes can get snowed under when you are comparing lens specifications, this one opens all the way to 16mm, which is very wide indeed, perfect for landscapes and the like. Most zoom lenses open only to 18mm, which doesn't sound like a big difference, but the extra 2mm really shows. You might not need a wider lens at all, except for very special applications.

$review_text.: This is one of my favorite Belkin Surge Protectors.  I love it because it looks excellent, functions properly, and the ON/OFF switch isn't that awful push-button switch from a prior model.Size: 12&#34; W x 6&#34; D x 1.25&#34; H.  The cord is 6 ft long (70&#34; wire, 2&#34; plug).Design: The ON/OFF switch is on the side of the surge protector, near the cord. the unit is a glossy black, looks excellent, and barely retains fingerprints. Fingerprints wipe off easily.  The plug is a straight-plug design.Outlets: There are 12 outlets total. The top row has a single outlet, 1&#34; space, and then 4 adjacent outlets, a 1&#34; space, and another single outlet. So 6 outlets top row. And the bottom row is the same thing. So there are 4 total outlets at the four corners that allow for larger plugs.  The space between the top and bottom row is 2.25&#34;. The center row has 2 USB charging ports.  There's a 1 A and 2.1 A port. It charges 2.1 A total, so if you use that one port, you can get 2.1 A from that one port. But if you plug devices into both USB ports, each one will charge at 1 A only. All 12 outlets have sliding covers which cover the 2-prongs, but not the 3rd grounded prong.Telephone/Ethernet: There's an In and OUT jack for Ethernet protection, and 1 IN and 2 OUT telephone jacks.Warranty: There's a 5 year warranty, with $25,000 coverage.

$REVIEW.: I replaced my QC2 ear pads after several years of use with these because they fit my budget. I replaced the pads for two reasons. First they were flaking off the black coating and it was getting everywhere. Second, I'm not sure if they had just broken down or if they never had much room in them, but they were causing pain if I wore them for more than an hour or two. I think they were not deep enough for my ears.These fixed both of those problems. Some reviewers have noted that these pads are firmer and therefore don't isolate sound as well. I haven't noticed any decrease in noise reduction, but I have noticed that the firmer pads keep there shape better when pressed against your head and as a result there is more room for larger ears.In short these are a suitable replacement at a discount over the bose replacements and for some people will be much preferable to the bose pads.

It is taped to the inside of an upstairs window (with no metal screen!) facing in the direction of the more important towers.

I love harmon kardon and their engineering. I have compared many similar speakers and these deliver great bass and mids for their price range. You won't find'em anymore in store but these were great. My girlfriend had these on her dell cpu when I moved in and I blasted these for 3 years. Not dead yet. My home stereo amp is HK, as well as my sister's. For those who opt to buy cheaper models with big bass and high treb, fools. Listen to these in various music genres. I listen to way too many types to list- a few - live classic rock, rock, classical, salsa, hip hop, house, blues, no complaints. If you can find a pair, pick em up. But please, don't expect to to throw an old school house party and fill the room. It's a 2.0 system for God's sake. For the price, these can't be beat. And I put these at full bass eq with jungle-drumn bass, and that says a lot. ps- I can also clearly hear the trumpets and congas on live music my friend's band plays & records live. Quality from HK as always. If you need to shop around, look on amazon for Boston Acoustics and new higher end Bose or JBLs also. I hate low end priced Bose as the bass is very lacking compared to these. And I love my mids so don't be fooled. Learn to compare frequency range as well. I have no issues with cell phone or my laptop with wireless modem onboard. Try the new JBL's amazon has (no headphoen jack- but worth the lack of perk) or the new slim tower boston acoustics .

$review_text.: This works great.  65 inch Panasonic plasma.  I can't comment on the screws because I took the advice of others and used some hex head lag screws I had laying around.  The only issue I had is that I can't reach the locking screws at the bottom once the tv is on the mount.  You need a really long screwdriver to reach them.  I just left them unlocked; the tv isn't going to lift itself up and off of the mount, so I didn't care enough to go and buy a really long screwdriver.  I guess the only benefit would be that it might slow a burglar down a tad if they were tightened.  Also, you might want to buy some 90 degree connectors for your HDMI and Optical connections.

$REVIEW.: I pretty much agree with the positive reviews on this system

 Good sound, good radio, very user friendly system.BUT BEWARE - Although you can play any generation Ipod on this system, the iM600 DOES NOT fully support the 4th generation Ipod Nano

 Unlike the previous generation units, it will NOT charge a 4th generation unit

 This means you have to either get a separate charger, or you have to plug into you computer often.I also noticed that if when not playing, you leave your Ipod docked into the iM600, it still seems to loose it's charge


 This is a bit of a nuisance.Just wanted new buyers to be aware of this.

I've used them on several long haul flights with great success - perfect for reducing background engine noise and listening to an audio book on a long flight. The battery life for me is about 5 hours with non stop use for audio books with the noise canceling turned on. With it off, I have gotten roughly 7 hours of on & off use as just regular earbuds on a regular basis. They synced easily with my cell phone and I've used then traveling around the world for about 9 months with no problems at all. I would buy these again without a second thought.

The box reminds is reminiscent of what a high-end watch would come in.After carefully selecting from the 8 different tips (5 silicon, 3 foam), I easily popped them and turned on my sound system. I was BLOWN AWAY! Without sounding too cliche', I was hearing things from favorite songs that I had never noticed before - and this is far from my first set of high-end headphones. As I bounced around from genre to genre, decade to decade, I was surprised at how well they handled such a variety of music. The Rolling Stones to Jay Z, to The Cure, to Garth Brooks, these things really made my favorite music sound even better.Although I believe good sound is a little bit more subjective than most audiophiles will admit, let me tell you what I heard: base is deep and distinct, but not overpowering while the mids and highs are clear without being tinny. All in all, they gave an impression of being on the headphones with the band in the studio.I highly recommend these without reservation.

$REVIEW.: I sold my Canon XSi in order to buy this Canon T2i, which turned out to be a mistake.  T2i takes great photos.  After a few months of study, I conclude it takes slightly better photos than Nikon models at similar prices. Yet, this T2i has one annoying issue: out of 6 resolution/compression settings (L,L,M,M,S,S), only the first M (with low compression) has no softness issues while JPEG photos taken in all the other 5 settings tend to be too soft for comfort (even at the sharpest setting). I can sharpen the photos in my Photoshop, but that requires some time, especially when I take a lot of photos.  I've contacted Canon for this issue and the rep doesn't seem to know T2i has this issue and advised me to send in the camera for a repair, which I haven't done. In the meantime, dpreview.com also mentions the softness of its JPEG photos in its "Cons" conclusion.  I've noticed some photos taken in Canon's newer model 60D also have this softness issue.
$SUMMARY.: Take great images but with some softness issue.

Brushes never seemed to get the last bit of dust off (and brushing can build up static and attract more dust).This gets all the dust off.There are many systems to clean records out there; I am sure that cleaning your records with any system is going to be better than not cleaning them . . . so buy something and use it religiously when you play your records.As I said, what seems to work for me is a wet system to get the initial gunk off old or used records, and then a dry system such as this to keep them clean.

$REVIEW.: My 7 year old son loves this portable speaker.  He uses it to listen to his music or watch his movies on my ipod touch.  I like it because I dont have to have him wearing headphones which ultimately blocks out the world to him.  At least with this, I can talk to him and know if he is ignoring me or not.Sound quality on it is not great but I wouldn't think that a speaker designed for kids would allow Mozart to sound like you are at the symphony anyway.  What it does do is provide just enough volume to allow him to do what he likes.  If you are looking for a real good speaker for a kid, then you are going to have to keep looking.Build quality is as would be expected.  It is made from low cost materials and ultimately I expect it will break at the hands of a child.  Lets just hope that the speaker breaks before the ipod.Overall, this is a cute item that my son loves.  He would rather use this than any other way to listen to what he wants through the ipod.  For me, it is a piece of mind that he isn't wearing headphones that could affect his hearing or give him the excuse to tune out the world.

$REVIEW.: HooToo 7 port usb 3.0 HUB with 2 charging ports is another great product from HooToo. I have too many gadgets at home like an iPad, a galaxy note 2 of mine and my wife has another, a nexus 7 etc. It's always a mess to have as many adapters as many devices. Here this small compact and sturdy gadget comes like a bliss. The 2 charging ports are also designed keep current needs where one with 1Amp is great for smaller devices like my dad's old galaxy nexus and and a 2amp for my iPad and note 2.I really liked its USB 3.0 compatibility and very useful for my mac pro and a western digital 2TB disk which is also usb 3.0. The LED indicators are nice to have with each port and the charging ports. Having convinent 7 ports enables me to plug many devices at once without the need of search my computer usb ports all the time.The setup is quite simple as there is actually no setup and no drivers download etc. It's a hot swappable device with plug and play feature. Highly recommended.

$review_text.: I purchased these headphones as an upgrade forom the Sony EX71's.  Having owned EX51's before that, I though I was used to the poor build quality of these types of sony headphones (and treat them quite gently now after 3 warranty EX51 replacements).  I can say the EX75's are probably even weaker, as I managed to make the right driver "flaky" after &lt; 1mo.My real objection is the difference in sound quality from the earlier models.  There is substantially less bass response than the EX51/EX71 models...  to the point where turning the volume up to get similar bass to the EX71's made the tinny highs physically painful to my ear, beyond just sounding overdriven.  If I had it to do again, I'd just have replaced the EX71's, and not tried for the "upgrade".

$REVIEW.: I ordered this product, but turns out it wasn't compatible with my system
Tere are two different AMD Phenom II X4 945 Deneb cpu's, this one, the HDX945WFGMBOX is a later revision of the 945 which uses C3 stepping, there is also the HDX945WFGIBOX  which uses C2 stepping
It may or may not affect compatibility for your system, but I the HDX945WFGMBOX did not work for my Dell Inspiron 570, I had to return it to the vendor and they sent me a HDX945WFGIBOX that worked perfectly...and yes, the vendor did operational check the one I sent back, it was not defective! I knew before ordering that there were two types of this processor ("I" and "M") but I didn't know that my computer would only recognize the "I"


I just wish I had the information in this review prior to ordering or I would've oredered the HDX945WFGIBOX right off the bat
Please just research your specifict system to determine compatibility, as I said earlier the issue I had may be isolated to Inspiron 570

I just wanted to get this word out for other Dell Inspiron 570 owners to save them some aggravation


The cpu itself was easy to install, the computer recognized the new cpu immediately on start up and I noticed a HUGE increase in speed and performance


Highly recommended cpu for an upgrade.

$REVIEW.: I should preface this review by saying that I am not an enthusiast when it comes to speakers and home theater systems.  Until moving into a new home that was wired for sound a couple of months ago I had never had external speakers for sound, though I did often visit friends and family with home theater systems and acknowledge that their sound quality was vastly superior to mine.  Net net, I appreciate what sounds good to my own ear, but I'm not someone who spends a lot of time comparing technical details when making this kind of purchase.  If I personally like how something sounds that is sufficient to me.Before receiving this home speaker system I was using theBose Acoustimass 10 Series IV home entertainment speaker system - Black.  This set was certainly not going to get me any cred with my audiophile friends, but I was happy with the sound quality even when playing movies rather loud.I found the set up of the speakers to be relatively straightforward and the directions detailed enough for anyone to set up and operate the system.  The only thing I would have wished was that the answers to the troubleshooting section were a bit more precise.  Thankfully I didn't need to use them, but had I, some of the answers to the troubleshooting questions would definitely have to have been googled in order for me to make sense of them.  It's not a huge deterrent, but it definitely made me appreciate that a lot of the gadgets I purchase assume a very low level of technical knowledge and write their directions accordingly.Once I had the speaker system installed and allowed for the 15-20 hours of operation time for it to be working at maximum efficiency, I was pretty satisfied with the sound quality.  For me, it sounded comparable to my existing set.  Though perhaps I would have noticed slight differences if I'd been able to do a true side by side comparison.  But to my ear, the sound was just as full and clear as it was with my Bose.  Even when using it to play various genres of music I never had a problem with it sounding dull or flat.I think my favorite aspect of this theater system though is how small the speakers are relative to my bose, especially the subwoofer.  For this Canton set it measures 9.1" x 14.2" x 16.5" vs. 16.33 x 8.13 x 25.33 inches for the Acoustimass Module that came with my Bose set.  I'm sure some would chide me for thinking about style as well as sound quality but since my living space doesn't afford a good place to hide the subwoofer, smaller for me is better.  The Acoustimass Module was such an eye sore, very bulky and outdated looking and no where near as easy to hide as Bose's marketing made me believe.  Granted this set doesn't have the high end, glamorous look of some of the home speaker systems I've seen in friends' places or model homes.Overall, I think this is a solid set for the money from a sound quality standpoint (at least to the average, casual listener) and those who want speakers that blend in/are discrete will appreciate the small size of the various components.
$SUMMARY.: Solid set for the $ and love the small size of the subwoofer!

$review_text.: This is my first Camcorder and I have to say I am REALLY happy with this. The picture quality is amazing and when I upload videos to either my computer or Playstation 3, the high-definition footage may not be up to the same quality as a few documentaries I have on Blu-Ray or HD DVD, but it is easily the crispest footage I've seen shot from an camcorder.It's also very easy to upload to either system and to Youtube. As I said I've never owned a camcorder before and have only used one back in college or shooting footage for friends.My only real complaints are the lack of an HDMI cable and the fact it has a mini HDMI cable slot instead of a full size HDMI cable. I had a few HDMI cables lying around for extra use, so I was a bit disheartened I had to buy a new cable just for downloading footage.This camcorder is very user friendly and if you're looking to export to YouTube or ITunes, it's amazing how simple and easy this makes it. With  dual slot SD card capability, you can store several hours of footage before having to upload.The JVC Enverio is a great camcorder for people who have never used one before and are looking for something simply and streamlined to welcome them into the world of making home videos. I can't wait to use this for Hallowe'en this year in Salem, MA.

Ty sound better than a lot of stock speakers too.-Do you have a hole that is about 6.5" and there's no sound coming out of it? Buy these.-Are your stock speakers made of paper? Did you accidentally knife a hole in them while you were skinning a deer on your passenger seat? These speakers will fix that.-Do you believe in string theory? Do you think that maybe your stock speakers permeate multiple dimensions at the same time and are worried that they may accidentally stay in another dimension permanently? Buy these, I think Kenwood would probably replace them for you if that ever happened.-Do you own a corvette? Probably shouldn't buy these.-Is your corvette from the 1980's? Maybe sound technology has progressed since your car was built and these may help, granted you need 6.5" speakers. I don't own a corvette, so I wouldn't know.-Do you have like $40?If you answered yes or thought about any of this, buy these if you seriously need speakers that are this cheap, otherwise what are you even doing looking at them?

$REVIEW.: A solidly built, multifunctional device with an ingenious interface... Too bad the whine of electronic interference from your car will most likely destroy the sound quality.  A ground loop adapter can eliminate this noise on your end (what you hear from the stereo), but only at the cost of eliminating the bass from your music.  As for the person you are trying to have a phone conversation with; they're just completely out of luck.  This would easily get 5 stars were it not for this problem, but due to this issue, I can only give it 3.  I've since replaced it with an Acoustic Research ARWH1 unit, which does a better job in terms of both call and music quality despite not even being designed as a car kit, and doesn't suffer from ground loop issues even when plugged into the car's power outlet.

$review_text.: First off I am deducting one star because it was initially shipped without the main screw that attaches this L plate to the bottom of the camera

This is sloppy quality control either on the manufacturer of the plate, the camera shop stocking it or Amazon

I had to do RMA and send it back and order another one which was a hassle and wasted my time.The L plate attaches to the underside of my Nikon D700 dSLR, Obviously it is not as big as the RRS plate ( I have a RRS straight plate that is beefier than this) and the fit is not perfect but for a generic L plate you have to accept the limitations.It fits the RRS BH55 ball head with the arca swiss quick release clamp quite well without having to remove the safety stop screws

 But when I tried it on the &#34;XCSOURCE Pro All Metal Camera Tripod Ballhead with Quick Release Plate&#34; it would not go through


I studied what was obstructing it and found that this ball head quick release system was not deep enough and the safety stop screws of this L Plate  ( 2 small ones on each side) obstructed it from sliding in


But if you remove one proximal screw on each side then it slides through and the distal safety stop screw makes it stop and prevented it from going through the clamp.I have yet to use it in real life shooting and will up date this in a few months.

However, after many months of use at the office, I've come to believe that these headphones are really something special.  It's hard to imagine getting such a full sound out of such an inexpensive/lightweight product.  They are easily driven by an ipod or smartphone, but they really shine when plugged into my laptops(with beats audio and without).  Solid, but tight bass, rich mids, and shiny highs help these headphones breathe new life into the songs that you've been listening to for years.  Do yourself a favor and stop thinking about it and just get yourself a pair.  You won't regret it.

You can listen to songs on your Apple device.  You can get Pandora.  It's pretty.  But it still sounds like a tiny little speaker with no stereo separation or evenness across the tonal range.  A lot of mid-range, though heavy on the upper tones.  Tinny top.  Bottom that suffers because there's no real mid-bottom to support it.If I were living in a dorm room or just wanted something to play while i'm sitting in bed this would be great.

$review_text.: It is significantly cheaper than the Nikon hood. It is about half an inch longer and has more hooding (less flower, more vignetting with flash).  It is difficult to put on and I do not appreciate using any force when working with my lenses (attachment  gets easier after a break in period).  A very obnoxious problem I found is that there is no mounting index, I finally figured out that you have to line the release button up with the mounting index on the lens and attach firmly.  Line up the writing with the lens index for the reverse.  I will see how it stands up to the rigors of wilderness photography, it is much better than paying 50$ (!!??) for the Nikon hb-48.  I would buy again before the NIKON hood.

$REVIEW.: I only bought this to replace a broken one on a justin clamp


So it makes me think, how many of these will i end up breaking in the future? Is this replacement better or worse? Or just the same

And it's not really cheap for a tiny bit of plastic.

$review_text.: These things work exactly as promised. I was able to use MiMH rechargeables in this GREAT shower radio:Sony ICFS79W AM/FM/Weather Band Digital Tuner Shower Radio (White).I imagine there are a FEW devices out there that need the higher discharge rate that C batteries can provide, but the VAST MAJORITY of devices use C batteries so the batteries last longer. So, yes, you will have to replace your batteries more often, but if you use rechargeable batteries, who cares?Enjoy.

$REVIEW.: I've had several UPS battery backups for my computers over the years. I've found it easier and usually cheaper to buy a new one when the batter inevitably wears out after a few years. The APC brand works well, keeping the computer running when the power flickers or goes off, giving you enough time to save your work and safely shut off the computer if necessary. It also provides good protection against power surges that can destroy computer equipment.I gave this model only 4 stars instead of 5 as it's on the small size. I use this model on my wife's computer, which is small and has no other devices attached, but on my larger, more powerful computer with several external devices attached, I use a larger model.

$review_text.: So I got this device three weeks ago.  I upgraded my iPod Nano which I love, but it doesn't have WiFi capabilities.  Yes, I've had a lot of fun with this thing so far.  Will the fun wear off?  I don't know, maybe.  I have used it at work several times for reference, but most APPS don't work if WiFi isn't available, and that's a problem here in rural Vermont.My biggest concern is the battery life.  I'd have given this more stars if it had any longevity, but it doesn't.  I've recharged it as directed, and I have a five star (out of five) recharging score.  Today I'm already down to 60% remaining, and I've only had the police scanner running for three hours.  How this will play music all day like my Nano does, I'm not sure, and I doubt that it will.  Regardless, the battery stays charged WAY LESS than they say it will.Bottom line... would I buy it again?  Yes.  I quite like it's dictation capabilities and SIRI.  Now that we're getting used to each other, asking it to look things up, or to send an email, etc., for me is pretty quick and easy.  (IF I've got WiFi).  The cameras are pretty decent, and the flashlight that I installed is really handy.  Last night I installed a calorie counter.  It looks like it's about endless as to what APPS are, and will become available.  It's a neat little tool, for sure.

$review_text.: I bought one of these cameras, set it up in my den, and later bought three more to provide coverage for other areas in my house.  Is it a great camera in terms of resolution and frame rate?  Not really.  But is it a great camera in terms of its price?  Absolutely.  You won't find better "bang for the buck" at this price point.First the good:(1)  It is very inexpensive; you'll be hard-pressed to find so many features at this price in other low-end cameras.(2)  Construction quality is very good; the camera seems sturdy and well-built.(3)  WiFi range is excellent - I am having no problems getting a good image anywhere in my house.(4)  PTZ gives you almost 360 degrees of view if you rotate from one extreme to the other.(5)  The built-in infrared diodes are bright enough to easily illuminate an entire room for nighttime viewing.(6)  You get a nice screw-in mount and a convenient retractable Ethernet cable bundled with the camera.Now the not-so-good:(1)  The camera lens has significant "fish eye" distortion.(2)  With a 640 x 480 pixel resolution, you're not going to be getting a good picture of an intruder's face unless he gets fairly near the camera in good lighting conditions.  If you need a higher-resolution image, you're going to have to spend more money on a better camera.(3)  The effective frame rate is not that high - maybe 3 to 5 fps if you're watching an image from outside your home network.(4)  The audio quality from the built-in speaker and microphone is adequate, but not very impressive.  You can hear what's going on through the camera, and be understood at the other end, but it's like talking through a long stovepipe.  On the other hand, it is more than adequate for a baby monitor.(5)  It is a pain to set up unless you know what you're doing.Fortunately, at least for Mac users, it's not that hard to configure it once you know the trick.  Here is what to do, assuming you have a Mac laptop and a wireless home router with at least one free Ethernet port:(1)  Copy over FOSCAM's "IP Camera Tool" app onto your Mac.  You can either copy it from the bundled CD, or download it from the FOSCAM site.(2)  Now open System Preferences on your Mac, and click on the Network icon.  When the network window opens, click on the Wi-Fi tab (if it's not already selected) and click the "Advanced" button in the lower right hand corner of the window.(3)  In the new window that appears, click the "TCP/IP" tab.  Write down the Subnet Mask and Router IP addresses, and then close System Preferences window.(4)  Now here's the tricky part:  you have to decide which IP address on your router you want to reserve for the camera.  For example, if your Router IP address is 10.0.1.1, you'll want to change the last number to use as your camera IP address, e.g. 10.0.1.61 or 10.0.1.100 for the camera.  However, you don't want to re-use an existing address that the router has already allocated.  You have two choices:  either log in to your router and check which addresses are being currently allocated, or just pick a number between 2 and 255 at random, e.g. 10.0.1.61, and see if it works.  Obviously these numbers may be different depending on the router.  For example, if your Router IP address is 192.68.2.1, then you can try 192.68.2.61 or 196.68.2.100 for the camera.(5)  Turn off your Mac's Wi-Fi connection.  Plug the camera into your Mac's Ethernet port using the supplied cable, but don't connect the camera's AC adapter yet.(6)  Start the IP Camera Tool app.  An empty window will open on your desktop.  Now turn on the camera by plugging in its AC adapter.  After about 20 seconds, the camera will begin to rotate through its start-up sequence.  At that point, you'll get several socket error warnings from the IP Camera Tool.  Click through these errors, and you'll finally get back to the IP Camera Tool window, which will show an Anonymous device (this is the camera) with an incorrect subnet error message, asking you to double-click to fix it.(7)  When you double-click the message in the window, a small window will open.  For the IP address, fill in the address you've chosen for your camera.  For the Subnet Mask, use the same number you wrote down earlier.  For Gateway and DNS Server, fill in the Router IP address you wrote down earlier.(8)  Leave the password field blank, with user "admin".  Click OK.(9)  The camera will restart.  After it has restarted, you'll start getting socket error warnings again.  Ignore them, unplug the camera, and quit the IP Camera Tool app.(10)  Now use the Ethernet cable to plug the camera into an unused Ethernet port on your router.  Plug in the AC adapter and wait for the camera to restart.(11)  Turn on your laptop's WiFi again.  Open the Safari browser and type in the IP address you chose for the camera, e.g. the http prefix followed by 10.0.1.61.(12)  If you did everything right, you'll be able to log in to the camera's built-in web server and configure it using the Device Management tab.  Specifically, you can scan for a wireless network list under "Wireless LAN Settings", select your own home network, enter the password, and click the box labeled "Using Wireless LAN".  Click Submit and the camera will restart again.(13)  Now unplug the camera from the router.  Again, use your Safari browser to access the IP address of the camera (you may have to close and re-open the Safari window).  If your wireless connection is working, you'll be able to log in to the camera again, and make any other configuration changes that you want.If you want to use your camera outside of your home network, you'll need to learn about port forwarding.  I won't go into that, because it is dependent on the router, but for my cameras I use port 80 for the internal port of each camera, and ports 8101 through 8104 for my external ports, respectively.  It works fine, and I can watch my home over my iPhone without any difficulty.As a final note, I strongly recommend that you buy the Foscam Pro app for your iPhone / iPad.  The same app will work for both (you only need to buy it once), and it will give you complete control over the camera, including access to the audio features.

$REVIEW.: The Kenko 2.0X Pro 300 lens multiplier is a cost effective way to have a much larger lens.  Kenko uses Hoya glass lenses in this product. Hoya lenses are among the best made glass lenses in the world. The different lens series made by Canon causes not all lenses to work with the 2.0X lens multiplier made by Canon. Specifically, Canon "EF-S" lenses are NOT compatible. Buyers should always be mindful of compatibility when mixing and matching products for your favorite camera. For example, while I was searching for a 2.0x lens to add to my Canon lens (75-300mm) I noted that some listings on the web listed a lens multiplier with similar nomenclature information with one small difference.  The difference I noted was with "DGX" Vs "DG".  The "DG" lenses listed were physically different than the "DGX".  The picture shown for a "DG" lens had a small metal tab with contact pins which protruded beyond the edge of the lens on the end that connects to the camera body. This metal tab is not present in the "DGX" version.  This tab would not have fit my lens. As with all multiplier lenses the auto focus function may not work at all magnifications.  I tested the multiplier with my zoom lens and found no picture distortion on the outer edges at any setting while making small manual adjustments. Picture quality was consistently excellent. The quality of workmanship of the lens is exceptional.  Kenko uses a metal housing for the lens.  I hope you find this info helpful.

 Most frequently they can be somewhat complicated , if NOT VERY complicated to get &#34;just right&#34; , which you frequently DON'T

 Ugh


 Nothing like that kind of frustration to drive you crazy.With Moshi iVisor XT , you can immediately feel the quality, and the instructions are easy to follow - plus it is EASY to work with


Removable if need be, but I got mine on in under a minute -- pure perfection!  This differs from my experience from any of the other screen protectors I have every used.While not inexpensive, it has is ultra-high quality, and most importantly, the EASE of installation

Bubble free, and just perfect!  No more staring at the package thinking &#34; I hope I am UP to this &#34; -- there is no cringe factor here!  You will be shocked at how easy  it is!  Outstanding.

$REVIEW.: I purchased the Defender Stealth DVR for a friend of mine who lives in senior housing because of many complaints about items disappearing from their apartments when they are away.  I selected the Defender because it did not require use of a computer, wi-fi or the internet.It turned out to be a lousy choice for the following reasons:(1) It must be plugged into an RCA video input on a TV just to program it, and the menu is confusing and annoying.  Not good for an older person, or even me.(2) It isn't "stealthy".  It looks like an obvious surveillance device.  The electrical cord hanging from it makes it difficult to disguise.  The continuous green light and the red light in back of it that goes on when recording is triggered  is a dead giveaway.(3) The video quality is grainy, which makes it hard to identify who actually entered the room.  It must be used in daylight with the light coming from behind the camera in order to get a decent picture.  Not so good at night or in shadows.  Not good in close quarters.(4) The date/time setting is used only to trigger continuous recording at a specified time.  There is no record of the time embedded into the recording.  That means there is no way of telling what time the motion detector activated the camera.  It is useless as a tool to identify when a suspected person entered the room.(5) And or course there is no corresponding audio; only low quality video.It seems like too much money spent on such a difficult to use, poor quality surveillance camera.  I wish I had bought mine on Amazon so that I could return it.

$review_text.: It seems to me that more people are much more interested in downloading music off the internet, rather than purachasing it in the tradional record stores. With Apple's success of the Ipod, many companies have all tried to capture the success that they've brought out within the past sevral years. The previous main edition had a very good shelf life with a 20GB capacity. The edition not only was successful, but many thought it couldn't be done any better. Well, Apple has proved that they could top the MP3 success they've had before, in a all new Ipod. Is it ready for you?The Apple 30GB Ipod is a sleeker and more portable Ipod than its previous edition. This edition holds much more in the way of music it had before, with as many as 7,000 songs possible. On top of that, you also can hold video clips of television shows like The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, or South Park which can be downloaded as podcasts from the itunes website. The battery life is also an important improvement, with a battery that can possible last for up to 20 hours. The color display is also a brighter, and more elequent display for anyone who loves to watch movies or television shows. I just wish though that there could've been a improvement in volume control.All in all, if you don't own a Ipod, now is the really the time to get one. With the hype of upcoming MP3 players from Microsoft and Sony, many still want their music on he go. I love this MP3 player a whole lot, because it is a lot more convient than ever before.Price: B+Easy To Operate: A-Convience: B 1/2+Fun & Enjoyment: A-Overall: B+

$review_text.: I guess the easiest way is to break this review up into pros and cons.PROS1.  Easily learns any signal from any infrared device.  I can even control my portable heater and fans with this remote.  Works with all my electronics, including my Comcast DVR.2.  Has GREAT range, works like an RF remote since you can point the remote in any direction and the signal registers.  Some of my old remotes had to be pointed directly at the device, this remote has great range.CONS1.  It is obvious Sony just used an old design they had leftover from some old remotes and decided to use the case as a universal remote.  The instruction manual is dated 2006 so you know it is at least four years old.  The remote feels like a 2 X 4 piece of wood, very uncomfortable.2. This remote is huge!  I am 6'3" with very large hands and I can hardly hold this thing.  I laughed when I first opened the box since I couldn't believe how big it was.  Looks way bigger than the picture.  The cheap looking black and blue colors looks like a design from 1991.3.  Predefined buttons didn't work at all, not even for Sony products since again this remote was probably created back in 1990.  You can get the buttons to work if you manually program them all though.4.  I was mad to see that my local Walmart has a $19 dollar Philips remote that has the same features and is normal sized with comfortable looking curves.  I wish I would have tried that one instead.5.  The little menu/guide/exit buttons feel like pimples.  I feel if I rub them hard enough they may pop off the remote.6.  Like someone else has mentioned, it would have been great if there were two more buttons above the rewind/play to serve as skip buttons, perhaps even page up and page down buttons above the volume and channel buttons would have been great too.7. All of the buttons feel alike besides the big volume and channel buttons.  I am the type of person who memorizes the placement of the buttons and feels for them, but this remote has flat buttons so they all feel alike.  I never noticed how well my Comcast remote is designed since all of the buttons have their own shape.  The reason I bought this remote was ONLY because I kept accidentally hitting that ON DEMAND button on my Comcast remote.  I even called Comcast to see if there were remotes without that button, and I even tried prying the remote apart to remove the on demand button, but those failed so I wanted to try this remote to see if I could replace it.So yeah it can control all of your infrared devices, but it is really big, ugly, and feels like a piece of wood.  I do use it for my stereo and DVD player, only for simple up/down volume controls and skip functions.  I should design my own remote, cheap with slick curves.  Oh I just did a search and found the universal learning remote that is made my Philips here on Amazon:http://www.amazon.com/Philips-SRU5107-27-Universal-Control/dp/B0026L7B8K/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&s;=electronics&qid;=1263806014&sr;=1-14I would recommend trying that remote as it looks more up to date, more comfortable, normal sized, and most of the common functions we use in this decade.

I said it.Now that I've gotten that out of the way...Purple function works fine! Very bright and it even pools out the edge onto the mouse.Was not expecting the "quiet key" functions. I'm not sure how I feel about this feature yet. You have to get used to the fact that you don't get loud and bold clicks and tactile sensation that you're used to. Since most of the other computers I work with have generally similar noise and sensation, it can be strange coming home to this keyboard at the end of the day. Sometimes you just want to press enter super loud!Other than that - it's a keyboard. It works. It even works with my KVM without resetting the color, which is a bonus.

$review_text.: The Panasonic TA-1 camcorder is small and so easy to use!!  Just press the Rec button to record and the Play button to watch playback


The video is crisp and clear and the sound is clear as well

 It records in HD and allows to upload your videos on Facebook, and Youtube.The TA1's built-in USB terminal means that there's no need to carry around an adaptor
You can charge the battery by simply plugging the USB terminal into a PC
It doesn't take long to charge.It doesn't come with software but once you plug in, the application downloads but it may or may not be compatiable with your computer

I did experience some problems loading the application.The other thing that I didn't like was that it doesn't work until you put a memory card in it and of course, it doesn't come with one


 So make sure you purchase a memory card with this product as well


 But other than it, it's easy to use and the video resolution is very good
 It's perfect for someone like me, who's just using it to capture family moments and special occasions.

$REVIEW.: I was a little leary after reading the reviews of so many smart covers.  This works just as planned.  It is the most comparable t the Apple version of the product.  The magnets line up and work fine for the sleep feature.  Also has magnets the allow the case to stay rolled up while in the typing postition.  Also when in book position and the flap is folded completely back their is set of magnets the keeps it attached to the back cover.  Works Great and I am ordering other colors.

$review_text.: Linksys did a great job with this product.  It is sleek and stylish, while still providing high levels of connectivity within my three story home.  I have it installed near the ceiling of my basement.I am using the 5ghZ "N" band for my PS3 only at this time. The PS3 is connected via ethernet to the Linksys Dual-Band Wireless-N Gaming Adapter. The rest of my computers (PCs, iPhone, and Macs) use the 2.4 ghZ "B-G Mixed" band.Both networks share the same DHCP pool, but have different SSIDs and passphrases (a Linksys recommendation).The first thing I did was update the firmware.  I have not experienced any dropouts or heat issues.UPDATE: After a few weeks of use and after adding more wireless devices to my network, I have more to say...and its not so rosy.  Both my Lenovo T61 and Apple Macbook Pro have issues when I tried setting the 2.4ghz network to "Mixed" (B, G, and N).  When one computer is working fine, the other seems to have issues connecting to the network, usually the T61.  I had security set to WPA 2 Tkip or AES (since this router allows this "either or" setting).  I have since changed WPA TKIP based ona recommendation I found on the Linksys forums.  It has only marginally improved things.The bizarre part about this is the T61.  It works fine over the 5GHz N setup, giving me 130Mbps.  On 2.4 ghz I had to switch to "B-G Mixed and enable SSID broadcasting to get a connection initially.  After that I could re-disable SSID broadcasting.So, for my house I have the following:  PS3 on 5Ghz N.  No connectivity issues with the Linksys Dual-Band Wireless-N Gaming Adapter.  100% uptime.I also have an iPhone ("B/G" speeds), Appletv (Supports B/G/N), Macbook Pro (Airport "G" card), Buffalo Wireless Extender ("G"), and PowerMac (Airport "B" card).  Since my iTunes library is on the Macbook Pro, I had to run the appletv over my 2.4 ghz network for the Appletv to see it.  I was hoping that since both networks share the same address pool, that devices on the 2.4ghz network could see those on the 5Ghz N network.  I expected bridging between the two wireless bands because they are in the same device.  Maybe I am doing something wrong.  If so, please comment on your setup.

$review_text.: I bought this MK270  when I _thought_ I lost the receiver on my existingLogitech Wireless Desktop MK320 Combo, but I found it after a week..


Now, more about the MK270.My top positive (++) and negative (--) points on making this set my primary keyboard / mouse sets now :+++ Having the Cursor movement keys / arrow keys in the "inverted-T layout" a little further to the makes using them much easier than on the MK320
Having the page up / page down keys -- in the style of a standard 104-key IBM PC (Windows, US layout) keyboard -- also makes them easier for me to use.+++ Larger function keys (I gotta be able to use the ALT-F4 combo easily!) are easier to access, and a little greater distance from the top row on the keyboard prevents key selection errors.++ this "Unifying USB Receiver" offers use with a greater variety of mice and keyboards.+ slightly less expensive than the one I had already.+ has a slightly smaller footprint than the MK320.- (a slight minus) a slightly higher hand position in typing (but I've gotten over that already).- (not an issue to me, but maybe others will) has fewer media keys available on the top row, but I don't use them...If you like Logitech products, check the "Which Logitech Keyboard and Mouse Combo Is Right For You?" on the Product Description for the MK270 to see what features you need most.For me, no regrets


Enjoying having two Logitech sets now !

$REVIEW.: The 50mm lens was the first lens i had many years ago on my Nikon then and found it was a missing lens in my current camera and am not at all disappointed as this lens does it all so well there is nothing to say except that it will not disappoint you under any use you may have.  Literally every shot is like WOW what a great shot.  I am not disappointed even on AF mode.  I see and get exactly what i expected and like it so much i rarely use any other lens.  Low light results may surprise you and the focus gives immediate results.  i could go into a lot of details about the lens, but it is easy to say it is a first quality choice and a absolute must have for your camera.randy

I am very happy with it, and I bought it due to the battery life, it does run about a full 8 hours of battery, plays videos pretty good, and internet is fast.My only downfall is the windows 7 starter is just weird, you cant change the wallpaper unless you get a third party program, seems to eat a lot of recourse at times.

$REVIEW.: This card is amazing for the price!! You can't beat this performance for $80 after rebate. I can run pretty much any game on high or ultra setting without any lag. Haven't checked the frame rates yet but it's plenty fast enough for smooth gameplay. It boosted my WPI to 7.1 in both Windows Aero and 3D gaming graphics. I was comparing this with the Radeon HD 6850 and I decided to still with this one for the price/performance comparison. If you're just a casual gamer or just looking to speed up your computer, then this is you're card. But if you're looking to run new games on large 1080p monitors, then you might want to go with something a little higher like the 6870 or a gtx. Also this card is powered only from the board which was a surprise but this means you can run it from a fairly small power supply, even though I have a 600W. Overall, it's a good buy.

Fact is it works fine, of course you'll need something much better than dsl aka high speed internet from those that provide it, example 3mbs down 512k up etc, because once you start using it to watch netflix or use to listen to music like pandora that's it, you'll lose calls or drop them like flies. There's not enough bandwidth. The audio quality is better to me than, the vonage line I just gave up 2 days ago, and I've had it for 12 years. I've had magic-jack before, about 8 years ago, but had the bandwidth issue. This time I ran thru the setup on my windows 8 PC & chose to use without PC & wallah, happy dance. Other than that, it really works as advertised. That's $480 I'll save the 1st year, it doesn't sound like much, but as food prices continue to rise, these will become more appetizing.

Naturally, after dusk it was fairly useless.GPS logging was another feature I wanted. I worked really well. Just a caveat - it eats a battery in about 8 to 10 hours, so you better have a spare.Underwater feature - love it. Just works.A minor disappointment - the wifi hot spot was not performing as well as I hoped. I was only able to get small size copies of pictures from it. It's OK for preview on the tablet, but for actual usage you gotta use the card reader.The provided software works, but as most of its kind, if you have anything else (PS, LR, Picasa, Aperture, etc), you won't be needing it at all.

I ran to an old Dell projector at 1600/900, no fuss and on a 24 inch monitor at 1920/1080 again without any fuss. Obviously VGA has no sound but my Dell was able to detect optimum settings and suggest the correct resolution. Cable quality is good as are the connectors, the VGA slot had screw fastenings so you can just stick it onto a cable permanently if you wish for easy carrying.

I can't say how long the memory will last nor if there will be any issues in the future.  What I can say is that it was easy to install and currently works great.  I popped it in and the computer recognized it as soon as it was fired up.  Thanks Komputer Bay and Amazon.  Other websites suggested unplugging the laptop and pulling the battery before removing the old memory and adding the new.  I followed that advice and it worked for me.  Good luck in your endeavors.

 Does not drop connection

I bought it refurbished from Electronica Direct on Amazon.com and it came in Linksys box with 90 days warranty (its exact box which you get from Linksys/Cisco; I know this since I bought Linksys modem refurbished directly  from Cisco store and it came in similar box)
I think Electronica Direct is a very good store or seller and they will sell you good product

To fix it I have to get a so called "DMD Chip" which will cost me around $165. To be fair, from reading online it seems to be a DLP technology occurrence and many Optoma owners have the same problem.

$REVIEW.: I bought the refurbished unit for $59 with free shipping
 You CANNOT find anything that compares to this deal anywhere!  I looked at all the local stores in my area
 The selection was poor and anything descent was $99 or more
 Just search Wally's website for Shelf Systems

 That should give you some perspective of how great a deal this Panasonic really is (even if you don't buy the refurbished model).I have always trusted Panasonic, but it is difficult to find this unit sold in stores
 It came in a plane brown box but had the proper foam packaging, manuals and remote

 It looks just like new


 The refurbishment was done very well and this unit has performed like new ever since.In addition to the iPod dock, it has a door on the top that conceals an Aux In jack so any MP3 player can be used with it


 What I really like about it (I am not an iPod user) is the fact that the iPod dock slides neatly inside the unit, so you don't have to constantly be reminded that you don't have an iPod.The remote is simple and looks very similar to the Panasonic DVD remotes that we have around the house (Panasonic makes some of the best DVD players out there)

 This is a fantastic deal and is certainly worth a look.

$review_text.: I purchased this here on Amazon from TV-Armor's marketplace shop. Screen protector was delivered the day after I ordered (not bad for $4 shipping).In terms of the product itself, it was exactly as described. Very clear. It does introduce some reflection, but not very notable. If you have a lot of windows it could create problems, but thankfully the TV this went on does not have windows around it. In a normal room environment you barely notice it's on, which is the way it's supposed to be.I had a couple install questions (mostly wanted to double check things) and the 1-800 number on the instruction sheet got me through to a live person immediately and I had immediate answers to my questions. Definitely worth the money.As a side note, they also make an "Anti-reflective" model. In a normal indoor lighting environment without bright lights or windows shining on it, you won't need it. So do some research about which you need and unless you actually need the anti-reflective version, save some money by getting this Standard version.
$SUMMARY.: Great protection for your TV

$review_text.: This came up when I searched Amazon for compressed air cleaners for electronic products, but it is NOT compressed air

When they say cleaner, they mean cleaner--as in spray on, not through a straw but like wood furniture polish, and wipe off with a cloth
If you're looking for basic canned air cleaners, this is not some new-and-improved version that's anti-static

This is canned spray-on liquid, not canned air.

The biggest drawback is I notice streaks on my screen from some kind of residue, maybe an oily type substance from the leather that causes lines.  You can wipe it off.

$REVIEW.: My initial impression was much like several of the low star reviews on Amazon
 The sound was muddy and overall unimpressive
 Then I put on something truly stereo, Tom Petty - Free Fallin, and realized I was getting no vocals at all

 So I got suspicious and grabbed my earbuds

 Sure enough, Tom's voice is nearly completely isolated to the right ear


 I took another hard look at my new Philips headphones and realized that at the breakaway joint near the headphones the long cable was not properly plugged into the short cable

 It took more force than I was expecting, but with a little more pushing it then seated nicely


 After that, the sound was MUCH MUCH better

 It didn't take an inordinate amount of force, just more than I expected


 The plug "felt" seated before, but it wasn't

 Now I'm sure it IS seated and life is good.After fixing that problem, I am definitely enjoying these headphones

 They are comfortable and sound pretty darned good

 I'll try to update the review in a month once I've spent a few weeks with them at work all day long

 We'll see if they are worthy replacements for my beloved Senn HD457's that finally couldn't take any more cable repairs.One Month Update:Love these headphones even more now


 I wear them every day at work and they sound even better than my old Senn HD457s did

 My only problem is, the Senns were on-the-ear, while these are around-the-ear, so my ears get warmer than they did before
 The cord is great


 They are comfortable


 Everything about them speaks quality.If your Philips Stretch headphones sound muddy, make sure the plug up by the headphones is in nice and tight

 Makes all the difference in the world.

$REVIEW.: The product is easy to use and can extend your network where you don't already have network cabling or wireless coverage. I used it to connect to a tv in an area where my wirless coverage was weak. The setup and connection took a few minutes after installing the software on my computer. Although the instructions recommend against plugging the adapters to a surge protector, I was able to use it with surge protectors on both ends of the connection. The only annoyance is that the light stays on and flickers. It does not turn off when the remote device is off (tv). In fact both adapters' lights stay on and flickers 24x7. Overall, this is a good product to extend your network when 1) you can't get the network cabling to the remote location or 2) the wireless coverage is weak or lacking. This is good for a one to two devices in remote and different locations. If you have multiple devices in the same area, it may make more sense to do the cabling or move the wireless router for better coverage. At approximately $30 per adapter, you will need to weigh the cost of the devices versus the cost of cabling or an additional wireless router.

$review_text.: My wife had one of these for a year or so - she got the nexus 7 immediately upon release. I just purchased another n7 for my son, and picked up the same case (different color), and he likes it too. Good case. Not too fancy. Good protection. the case folds all the way back to hand-hold it, or can act like a prop, at a couple of angles. Device goes in and out relatively easily, but feels secure. When closed, the magnets hold it firmly shut, and provide good protection. When you open it, the magnets &#34;auto wake &#34; it - which is pretty neat. all ports etc are accessible. Not really much to improve.

$REVIEW.: I've had an MK250 that I gave away to my in-laws, so I had to get a new wireless keyboard/mouse set.I forgot the model number when I was ordering so I just thought this one would be the same, but it's a bit different.The keyboard is more or less the same, but the mouse is different.One thing I liked about the MK250 was the mouse because it only took one AA battery and so was very light.The mouse on the EK100 is heftier (because it takes two AA batteries). The scroller also makes an odd noise (feels cheaper...).Too bad they don't sell the MK250 any more...Also, there are no on-off switches on both the mouse/keyboard.The USB dongle is also bigger than the MK250s and has a USB wire running out of it as opposed to USB flash type. The keyboard/mouse also requires pairing which isn't required by MK250s.Still, everything works very well, but I'm gonna get another keyboard/mouse set for work as the USB connector is not very good to be using with a laptop on the go.

$review_text.: Pros: Small, fits into any pocket easily.Internal rechargeable Lithium-Ion battery holds enough power for all day normal use.Picture quality surprisingly wonderful. I also like very much the Enhanced Colors feature, which makes colors truly beautiful (this feature not available on the previous, Zx3 model).Very easy to operate with one hand.Great Image Stabilization.It is truly watertight, works well in and under water. NOTE: Do not forget to set Underwater scene setting to increase the quality. Make sure lids on each side are fully closed and locked with latches.Photo quality is quite good, when taken in bright daylight.Cons: After switching the power off, all settings go back to default, except video resolution. Example: If you set filming in an Enhanced Color, this setting will work until the power is off, after which you would need to set it on again.LCD Screen is bright enough in low light only. On a sunny day even in a shade it's near impossible to see anything. Therefore changing any settings is very hard in a bright light.Both videos and stills show significant digital noise when taken in less than bright daylight.The battery is non-replaceable, unless you are very handy with small electronics and willing to take it apart. Otherwise, the camera dies when the battery does. But both my Kodak Zx3 (now 4 years old), and Zx5 (about 2-years old) are working perfectly fine with their original batteries.Overall it's a good, compact digital waterproof camcorder for outdoor daytime use.
$SUMMARY.: Great little full HD camcorder

$review_text.: Great price and it works

In retrospect I wish I would have bought white ones because even though these are small, the black against my white ceiling doesn't look great, even with black speakers
 They are easy enough to use/install and they do have a lot of adjustments so you can get the right angle on your speakers


 The only real complaint I have, is that instead of using the pressure of the bolts to adjust and hold the speakers in place, I wish the bolts went into a groove or something that gave more security that they are going to keep the speakers from falling on my head
 I am sure I won't have the problem, the speakers are mounted solidly, but the extra security of the bolt going into a hole or groove, rather than just relying on pressure, would be much better

 The other problem I encountered was with the center speaker
 My center speaker is mounted horizontally and the mount holes for this speaker are on each end, instead of the middle


 If I had realized that, I would have ordered the 6 pack of these, for my 5 speakers
 I was able to mount the center speaker, but had to modify the speaker/mount to get it to work


 Overall, I did like these, and they work


 The price is great also.

$REVIEW.: The letters printed on the keys are tiny and hard to see, especially in low light


Older buyers beware of this!Also,the wireless receiver is weak
With keyboard and mouse two feet to one side of the computer tower, and with the little wireless receiver plugged into a front USB port on the tower, mouse movement was often not picked up by the receiver


Very frustrating

Plugging the receiver into a USB port on the rear of the tower gave even worse results

Now using a Logitech VX220 wireless mouse which works much better, and got a wired keyboard which is backlit and has large letters (Saitek Eclipse lighted keyboard)

Outstanding!Saitek Eclipse Keyboard ( PZ30AU )

$review_text.: The bad news - I needed a tripod urgently and ordered this one assuming it would support an average professional DSLR camera/lens combination weight of up to at least 6 lbs. When I opened it the tag on the tripod said 4.4 lbs maximum. I checked the listing, and there's no mention of maximum load for this or any of the other Vanguard tripods. I feel this is a huge oversight, and had to return the tripod.The good news - despite not being quite study enough for what I need, this tripod seems well built and good value for money. If you like 3-way pan heads, this one is very smooth. The bubble levels on the head are a nice touch, and the camera mount is good quality metal and locks and releases easily. The leg locks are quick and easy, and the foam grips and nice padded bag are a bonus. For traveling with a small/medium camera or camcorder, this would probably do most people just fine if there's little to no wind.Bottom line - nice looking tripod, worth 4 stars. Until the maximum load spec oversight is corrected by Amazon, I suggest doing a web search to find the full specs of any tripod before buying it here. I did exactly that with the next Vanguard tripod I ordered.

This light model works from the built-in battery and from plug-in power as well.  I haven't had a chance to test life the battery for continuous shooting and on/off use yet.  But with the option to use when plug-in, you can save the charge when shooting an indoor interviews. Also, with this option the light is not a total uselessness if the built-in battery dies. The price is very inexpensive.  You can pay a lot more for other products which produce the same mount of light. I'm pleased with the purchase so far.

$review_text.: I picked this up in addition to an E4000 version.  This one is generally better.The bottom end of this is in the 37MHz range.  Don't expect to pick up long-wave or AM broadcasts.Picking some lower-end areas will either show up silent, with strange device noises, or maybe fail to open the device with libusb0.I can pick up ADS-B really well with this.  Higher elevation and better antenna helps too, but this blows away the E4000 even with a favorable gap.Sensitivity is pretty good with this, and so FFT contrast is good.Also, trying kalibrate, this varies by as much as 22khz from reliable sources.  That's mostly thermal issues on the low quality oscillator, however, I found this to be more consistent than the E4000.  This was -22kHz, plus or minus 1kHz.  That's pretty easy to work with.  If it's not just because of where I'm sitting temperature wise, this might even sync with GPS on RTL-GNSS for those more daring, but it won't pick up PCS or higher freqs.This is generally a decent device.  Sensitivity is better than decent.This has a very small antenna port, sort of a micro-pal connector.  I haven't been able to find adapters to hook up other antennae to it.The alternative is an E4000 device, which I find to have better high-end range, but poorer sensitivity, and worse reception of aviation/radar signals such as ADS-B.I recommend picking up SDRsharp, because it just works.  Run the "zadig" tool to associate your RTL device with WinUSB.  Start SDRsharp and go into "Configure".  Turn off RTL-AGC manually set tuner gain to 36dB.  Set to an FM station, and use "WFM".  Hit "play" and tinker with things until you're happy.  You can find your shift value by setting your step size small, and then hit the center of the channel found, and see how much that differs from the formal channel frequency.  I found a shift of 3000 was close for mine, and I did some tweaking of the FFT display to make signals more visible.  Click and drag sideways to tune/scroll.  Click once to set the center freq within the current display (max about 2.5MHz), or click top/bottom of the numbers in the freq.  Alternatively, mouse wheel works great for tuning.

$REVIEW.: I also bought these because of the Wirecutter review, of the best headphones under $30.00


 I'll give you the thunder, right up front
 These are Great head phones......but  Their review made them sound like they were about the best headphone at Any price


 Well, that's not true, but they are the best I have found for this price.It has good, not great bass response


 They don't rattle under the stress of allot of bass, but, I'm a classic rock listener


 When listening to a Dio song, they washed out, just a bit under the strain of, &#34;Last in Line, Live,&#34;  and Lincoln Park's &#34;It Doesn't Even Matter,&#34;  Now that might not be fair, because I was really testing the limits of a pair of $16.00 headphones, but my $149.00 Dre's don't wash out under anything.My point is, if you're expecting the Wirecutter review to be gospel, with the, &#34;Best at any price,&#34; claim, it might be a bit of an stretch.I'd say it was a Great guideline.They have a nice mid, tone, treble, without being too tinny


 Nice full sound, and yes, they do have a good bass response

 They do sound like headphones that cost much, much more, but don't, (As I did), think you're getting Bose, or Dre quality bass.Very pleasant tones, easy to listen to, without cracking your ear drums.Should you buy them?  Absolutely, especially if you don't want to drop too much dime on a pair of phones, we'll all lose one day anyway

 Don't misunderstand what i'm saying,  These are Very, very good headphones, and are the best of several worlds

 Pleasant sound, a Very good working microphone, and comfortable fit.Sound is also a very subjective thing, like a fine wine, or cigar

 Everyone has their favorite

 I'm just saying don't expect a set of Bose, or Dres.Wire cutter got a little too excited.Just one guy's opinion, so please don't slam me too hard, but I just wanted to warn the next person who's expectations might have been just a tad too high.

$review_text.: I use this device to reach a computer that wasn't easily "wireable".  Installation was very easy, setup was a snap, but it seems that the two devices are not far from each other, in the same circuit breaker, but still doesn't achieve a very good throughput.  Granted, it knows this and gives me a red warning light that the connection isn't good... but sometimes the connection is great!I guess it must just be other electrical interference entering the lines from time to time, so it is what it is. They do get hot, and aside from the lower throughput than I'd hoped I feel concerned for how long they will last getting that hot on a regular basis.I wouldn't say not to buy this product, but it is not all that I had hoped & dreamed it would be. I haven't had to wire the area with Ethernet yet, and I don't have any "total lockups" that prevent data from flowing, but I wish the performance expectations were a little more realistic given the other similar reviews I see here.

$review_text.: Edit: I will be returning mines back to Amazon. I don't know how the other people set up their heatsink and still get like 50*C with a 4.0GHz+ overclock. I have a i7 2700k and even just overclocking to a modest 3.8GHz will bring me up to 75*C. Now while 75*C is not dangerously high, I still expect it to do better. I mean my old CoolerMaster 212 Evo+ was able to cool it ton 60*C at that speed.I know my ambient temperature matters which is why I did all of my stress testing at night time where the ambient is a constant 75*F.Anyway, I'm returning since I am disappointed in it. Don't buy it. Buy a Cooler Master 212 Evo or stick with what you have and save up for a liquid cooling system or a Noctua kit (Never had one but I heard good things).

$review_text.: We bought this TV at sams club and we got a 300 dollar in store gift card.  We bought the TV for 1200, do the math...good deal!Anyway, we were pleasantly surprised by how this tv makes our regular DVD's look HIGH DEF.  For this, we're going to hold off on Blue-ray for awhile.The TV is 120hz so the motion of the camera and subjects in the movie seem to move around different, but the quality is awsome.I don't have a lot of Electronic jargon to throw at you but you need to know you won't be disappointed with this TV.  The TV even has audio plug ins for 5.1 surround sound...I've only seen this on computers and receivers.I'm not sure when the best time to buy a TV is since the price are always coming down.  My advice is don't buy a TV with less than 120hz and 29,000:1 contrast ratio (depending on your budget).  Because this is the cream of the crop right now...well you can get a contrast ratio better than that, but realistically, you shouldn't get anything lower than that.Sears or most stores give you 60 days to keep your reciept for price matching.  if you own a club membership, I highly recommend you look there first and ask about free giftcards with a large purchase like this.

$review_text.: This is a great accessory to have as it helps keep the cord wound up nice and tidy. I think the little &#34;wings&#34; on the power supply are ok, but if you need to carry the other cord it is a pain. Not to mention one already broke off. The clip for the thicker cord is a must, so if you don't get it I would complain or send it back.

$review_text.: An apparent defect in software: Selecting to be NOTIFIED about toll roads, it automatically thought "AVOID toll roads." This resulted in seriously wrong directions in one case: From Cherry Hill, NJ to the Philadelphia International Airport. This is a 20-minute drive on major highways and bridge, but instead it showed a long, 1hour, 30 minute loop. I knew the road and ignored it, hoping it would recalculate. It did recalculate several times along the way, but always wanted to go back to its 1:30 route, until we arrived at the proper bridge.Even beyond the (proper) bridge, it kept recommending a different, complex road instead of the road that was clearly marked with signs "Airport". There were no traffic or construction problems. This is totally unacceptable. I had already spent well over one hour updating the maps via internet, ahead of time, so presumably it had the latest info. All this because it had assumed (in error) that I wanted to "avoid toll roads."I had the chance, recently, to drive in Florida, and compare this side by side, on the same car, with a "resurrected" TomTom 1505T ("T for Traffic") and the T is worth it. It sensed a blockage in US 95 (which was evident to my eyes) and shunted me over to a known boulebard, whereas after I turned onthe boulevard, the TomTom 50 kept trying to turn me around and get me back on US 95.Another very annoying flaw in the programming of the Tomtom 50: Once you are on a major freeway, as you approach every exit, TomTom50 keeps showing the distance to that exit (not because you want to get off, but "just to let you know...") and warning you to "bear left" i.e., stay on the main road, and after a dozen or so exits you get tired. The otherwise very useful, well-placed "distance to next significant change" becomes a series of short, 2.5-mile runs between exits...silly and useless... Whereas TomTom 1505T simply indicates you have say 15 miles to go (on the main route) before YOUR exit, and leaves you alone.Other than that, it is a very nice, easy to understand and view system, the voice is reasonably clear and adjustable for volume (I set mine at 75%), and the graphics are great.(This is my 3rd TomTom, the other two died one year, and 6 months after purchase, but I liked the method TomTom's interface and bought the third.)If I had to do it over again...I would still buy a TomTom, the larger 6" version, with Traffic.
$SUMMARY.: Updated: Some flaws, better get the T-for Traffic version

$REVIEW.: This is just some random thoughts from my use of this cameraI used this camera for about three months in various conditions, beach, inside a house....I read a lot about fan noise, personally not even once i noticed fan noise in my videos.Video quality is very good, i can't compare it to other top cameras but I think its worth the money.you definitely cannot get similar video quality from using any dslr camera. Sound quality is also great, i was impressed.I found that intelligent contrast feature helps a lot in some difficult light conditions.I almost never use auto feature, it just makes too many mistakes when filming people.video filmed indoors is ok, good but not great, it can be better. Outside is where it shines and thats why i bought itI would buy this camera again if I had to make that choice. I used Adobe's Premiere Pro to edit video on Macbook proi had no problem editing video, but I'm also using top of the line macbook proI also had no problems playing 60fp video from this camera on low end i3 processor, sandy bridge.Spending $800 dollars on camcorder is a lot of money when cheap $200 canon point and school camera can provide decent video if you don't zoom or move too muchso this camera is great if you want a lot of high quality video of kids... for occasional video, i would buy  something cheaper.

$review_text.: I have had five different headsets before this one.  Four of them were bluetooth.  The Lg Tone is by far the best in terms of fit, comfort, sound quality, functionality(listen to music), battery life, and portability.  *Everything I listed were problems I had with previous headsets.The in ear buds fit really well in my ear.  I have taken these on a run and they stayed in!  The main body which goes around your neck did not come off while I was running but does jump a bit, not a problem if you're listening to music but if you're taking a call like I did the other person will hear the bouncing of the mic more than your voice. (I've seen plenty of people run while on the phone).I have used this on many 1hr+ phone calls and I feel no heat or strange radiation-like effects(hot face, dizziness, yes I've had this experience before).  It's difficult to find a car charger for this headset, can't find it on Amazon, but I did successfully find two on Ebay.  I got one for 3 bucks and it works great.I also love that the Tone vibrates before it rings to let you know you're getting a call.  This has been very helpful since I step away from my iPhone a lot and forget to take it off silent.  It does ring in your ear but you don't get the added ringing from the phone.  The vibration is strong and since it's coming from the device around your neck you definitely feel it.Keeping the ear buds neatly secured in the magnetic hold on the main piece is such a convenience.  But I would still love to see a case for this for when you are not wearing it (if anyone has seen one please let me know!).I've had no problems with sound quality and have not received any complaints from callers.  I have had problems with bluetooth headsets in the past dying out after a year.  I have only had this for a month so I will need to update this next year*Overall I have no complaints about the LG Tone, I find it frustration free, easy to wear/use, I have gotten three of my friends to purchase, and plus for the price in comparison to other BHs, you're getting a great deal.  The only test now is how it will hold up in the long run!*I bought the black headset initially and am still using it today.  My positive review is based on the black headset which is just stronger and more durable.  The white headset on the other hand, which I purchased in December 2012 did not fare well.  I couldn't help myself when getting the white LG because I wanted it to match my white phone.  But the headset itself was lighter(in a cheap fake sort of way).  It worked for about a month.  I do not use the headset when Im exercising and it was December so I wasn't just sweating throughout the day.  So moisture could not have been the cause of the malfunction.  I realized the ON/OFF button was broken and loose.  It would not stay on either on or off.  So my initial feeling of it feeling cheap seemed to be on point.  It really was cheaply designed.  By the time I could complain, my time period to return was just a day or two off.  So now I just have to use the black headset.  Which is still running strong and I have no problems at all.  My fault for trying to focus on a look and not appreciating the function of what I already have.....good life lesson for me!  Im not sure if it was just the white headset I got but based on my experience I would recommend staying safe and sticking with the original black/orange.

The extra pockets gives me plenty of storage for extra batteries, accessories or anything I may want to pull out of my purse and throw in there.I love this bag because it does not look like I am carrying a camera bag.

$REVIEW.: Hello Everyone,2 years ago I started a search/research for a camera holster. Something that would be easy to use, safe while also considering my active life style such as remote travel, hiking and biking. I did not care to look like a SWAT team member, I don't like anything hanging around my neck and I did not care for 4K set up bouncing around my waist. So when I found the B Grip I was sold on it and bought 2 of them and additional plates, the plates also fit very nice on my Manfrotto head. The product has performed very well with out any issues. But one item to note, you must every so often clean the rubber plate with alcohol, it will improve the already strong grip.3 week ago after another short research of what is out there I bought the newest versions of the B Grip, another good design, they added more safety items to the already safe design. So far the performance is 100%. Anyone looking for camera holster should try this one, you can use it blind folded, no joke! I use 2 othemin my studio.I did look at another new interesting mechanical holster, very sim to Spider but I think most ratings came from investors so decided not to purchase at this time.UP DATE 2/20/13Hawaii, Florida, Alaska, Belize and 6 pro events. Still gets 5*Good luck!

$review_text.: My Sony DSC H50 fits in this case well.  However, it will not fit if I mount lens peripherals (ex. lens hood).  This also accomodates the Sony Cybershot H200, or a Canon G15.A shoulder strap comes with this case.  There are two side pockets.  One side pocket has my two spare batteries, the other pocket has a couple of SDHC cards and a lens cloth.  Unfortunately, the battery charger for my DSC H50 does not fit in either pocket, so I have to rely on my spare batteries and hope that I do not have to charge them when I am out and about.Padding seems decent, and will protect your camera from mild to moderate bumping.  I keep my camera in this case while and then stuff it in my backpack when I go out.  This case may be enough to protect from a low fall (a foot or less).  I am not comfortable with this case protecting from a drop from a table top (three feet) or higher.This case is good for carrying your camera on an outing, but I would go for a case with more protection if you are hiking, climbing, or out with lots of kids.

$review_text.: The "Panasonic BL-C131A Network Camera" is a feature rich wireless network camera that was surprisingly easy to setup for both in home viewing and Internet access. I was slightly concerned after reading the detailed steps in K. Lam's excellent review (currently the top review for this product) but now think that it must be dated since the included software took care of all the steps, including setting up the Internet access and free viewnetcam account.The box includes the camera, power supply, various mounting hardware, a security cable, documentation and quick start guides, and installation CD.The initial configuration of the camera requires it to be connected to your router with an Ethernet cable (not included) so it can be discovered by the installation software. Setup is very easy once the camera is discovered, but you must know your wireless SSID and security settings if you are going to use this in the wireless mode (also remember to set the switch on the bottom when finished).Once the basic setup is complete, the setup for remote Internet viewing next. The scary part of K. Lam's walk-through was not needed as the camera software took care of the port forwarding by talking directly to the router and then connected me to the viewnetcam website for registration. Once that was complete, I had my own easy to remember URL for viewing and controlling my camera. Total setup time was about 30 minutes and no calls to the tech support line were required.You connect to the camera via your standard browser (IE 7, Safari, and Firefox worked fine) so no proprietary software is required. The interface allows you to Pan and Tilt the camera and change most of the options by selecting the tabs along the top. It is a fairly intuitive interface and is easy to navigate for even those who do not posses an IT degree.A quick tip, the display resolution defaults to 320x240, which shows a fairly small image in the browser window, this can be changed to 640x480 in the drop down window to show a much large image.Overall, I am very pleased the image quality, ease of setup, and ability to remote view and control the camera.Highly Recommended!CFH

$REVIEW.: Like many people, I got this so I could run more than just two monitors with my Eyefinity-capable device

 Let me start out by saying that yes, it does that job effectively.There is something odd, however...Sometimes, the monitor that is connected with this connector just blinks out now when it didn't used to before this
 It will also do this strange horizontal scroll, just one that is very fast, and then it locks back into place, as though there is a timing issue


 In fact, now that I think about it, timing issues would explain both of those problems, as an active Displayport adapter handles timing (if I understand correctly)


 I supposed it's possible that I got a defective unit


 I do know that it isn't the monitor's fault, as it was connected with a passive Displayport adapter before and never gave me one second of grief.EDIT:  I originally had good feelings about this, but that has changed

 I returned the first adapter after being annoyed with the regular screen blips and blackouts and got a second one


 It did the same thing within the first 30 minutes, so I'm getting a refund on it and trying a completely different adapter.Take note that this adapter is NOT AMD/ATI certified


 I'm going to try one that claims to have that certification in the hopes that it works as expected.At this point, I simply cannot suggest this item for purchase.

$REVIEW.: Very hard to produce a case for everyone so this will modified. The paper holder, the whole flap will be removed so as to not block the camera lens. I use mine as a small computer and always with the dock (keyboard). When closing the two pieces the part of the case makes things too tight at the bottom of the case so about 3/16 of an inch will be removed, screen isn't going anywhere attached to the keyboard.As far as the case goes it's soft with good support built in. All the holes line up and I will make this fit my needs.Will update this once I modify the case for my needs.

$REVIEW.: I intended to use this flash drive primarily for mp3 file storage that would be used in a recently purchased Numark DDS80 DJ Controller Numark DDS 80 Professional DJ CD Player
Unfortunately the SanDisk flash drive is not being recognized by theNumark DDS80 and consequently it fails to mount

According to NuMark, that is because SanDisk has changed something in the low level architecture in a way that renders them incompatible with some devices


How do you tell if it will work in your device or laptop? I don't know the answer to that question

I guess you have to buy it and try it


If it works, great, if it doesn't, like in my situation, you need to return it and buy something else.I decided that I could use it for another purpose in my home network of computers
I have a mixed network of computers at home, both PCs and Macs
The included "U3" software only works on PCs


So that is another demerit
I used U3 on my PC for a while and it is interesting software but it has a rocky history of reliability


I can't trust my data to something that has anything less than a rock solid history of reliability.On a Mac, the U3 software is not recognized at all and is useless

If you're going to use this only on a Mac, you might as well reformat the drive to reclaim the space used by the U3 software


If necessary, you can always reinstall the U3 software by downloading the installer from the SanDisk website


You will need to download the U3 installer in order to safely uninstall the U3 software anyway.I had issues with the way the USB plug retracts into the body


When grasping the flash drive, the slider would get depressed causing the plug to retract into the body while I was trying to plug it in


Kind of frustrating.There is also the matter of the LED activity light

It flashes when the drive is being read from or written to

When not in use, it goes into a "breathing" mode where it pulses slowly


It never goes completely off which I found bothersome
Read and Write speeds were not particularly fast but adequate I suppose.Overall I was left with a largely negative opinion of this flash drive
It was not a good purchase for me

I've never had issues with any other flash drive that I've purchase and I've purchased other brands such as Patriot Xporter XT Patriot PEF32GUSB Xporter XT Boost High-Speed USB Flash Drives (Black), OCZ Rally2 OCZ USB 2.0 32 GB Dual Channel Rally2 Pen Drive (OCZUSBR2DC-32GB), lower capacity SanDisk (2GB) and a couple others.This flash drive did seem to work most comfortably with -my- PC, but U3 doesn't work at all on a Mac

I didn't really have any issues with the drive itself on the PC
However I did not like the U3 software and removed it from the drive to turn it into a "plain vanilla" flash drive
It's easy to remove the U3 software and reformat the drive
If you want to reinstall the U3 later on, you can, using a utility available on the SanDisk website.

$REVIEW.: Ok so the 'bad' things first.  The price.  Yes, it's a lot.  But there's simply no other device to compete with the functionality/flexibility of this one, if you want to record radio programs.  I see some have complained about the screen....but that's not really an issue for me.  It's clear, and easy to read.  Yes it looks a bit basic, but sometimes clarity is good.  As is clearly stated on the CC Crane website if you have the unit plugged in while recording AM stations a little noise is introduced onto the recordings, so it's best to record using battery power.None of the above 'issues' are sufficient enough for me to mark this device down, hence it gets the full five stars from me.Positives.  GREAT radio reception, better than all the other devices I own (especially on AM frequencies).  The timer facility is awesome.  Set it and forget it.  The display not only tells you elapsed time during recordings but also how much longer you can record at the selected bitrate.  For recording talk radio, the internal 2GB of flash allows for 65 hours of recordings at 64kb/sec.  I thought the unit would be bigger but it's actually very compact, which was a nice surprise.  It's also very solidly built.  It fitted perfectly into an old leather cellphone case I had lying around.  The lock function is good so you can start off a recording or playback and put it in your pocket, safe in the knowledge that hitting any of the keys won't affect what it's doing.Instead of buying the accessory pack for this device (which I suspect most people buy primarily for the mains adapter) which costs $40, I bought an adapter (mini-USB female to 'normal' USB female) on ebay for less than one dollar delivered, which attaches to a standard phone charger (obviously one that has the mini-USB male plug on it) and the CC Witness charges fine using this setup.  As for battery life, I tested it recording AM radio and it lasted 11 hours.All in all I'm extremely happy with it, and recommend it heartily for users who want timed radio recordings.
$SUMMARY.: Awesome device - no regrets

$review_text.: Lot's of people like the FZ200, myself included, but a vocal minority do not. Complaints usually have to do with noisy images, especially JPGs. Primarily this is due to the small sensor, and that Panasonic tried to reduce the severity of its noise reduction. Its "average" is another company's "low." The sensor is your typical 1/2.3", found on countless point and shoots. This particular sensor comes with 12 mega-pixels. Others on the market come with 16.That's a high pixel density. High density means fewer photons striking the chip, necessitating an increase in gain. More gain means more noise. The "quietest" camera I have ever worked with was a 6 mpix. Canon Digital Rebel. At ISO 100 there was no noise, just perfect smoothness. The chip was considerably larger (it was APS-C sized); the individual sensors on the chip received more photons; gain was low.I replaced it with a 10 mpix. Canon Powershot SX10IS. Pixel peep this thing's images, and you get ugly: Noise and smoothing artifacts galore. Fortunately, I realized in advance what I was getting into. I dropped the mega-pixels down to 6, and the noise largely went away. Pixel peep an image at this reduced resolution, though, and you will see rougher gradations and actual grain. It couldn't match the smoothness of the DSLR. None-the-less, I found the camera acceptable. I got spoiled by the ability to zoom from 28-560mm in a smallish package.The FZ200 is slightly larger than the SX10, but the same comments apply. If you want less noise, shoot at lower resolution, or get a camera with a physically larger chip.There is another issue, one that most people fail to notice: Diffraction. All optical systems have it, and this is primarily related to the size of the optics. Bigger is better. The bigger the optics, the smaller the diffraction effects. The smaller the f-ratio at a given focal length, the smaller the diffraction. Assuming well made optics, diffraction is what limits the resolution of a lens. The smaller the diffraction effects, the better the resolution. The onset of the diffraction limit is gradual. Low contrast detail is the first to go, followed by the ability to resolve high contrast detail.With point and shoot cameras, the lens often lacks the resolution to take advantage of the density of the chip inside. That is true of the SX10. At 10 mpix., you can only hope to achieve the chip's resolution at 28mm. As you zoom towards telephoto, the f-ratio of the lens increases, like on most point and shoots. Using widely available diffraction calculators, I estimate that even shooting at 6 mpix., I probably don't get much resolution benefit beyond 300mm.Consider the FZ200. At 12 mpix., you start running into diffraction effects at f2.4. You start noticing them in the loss of low contrast detail at about f3. High contrast detail starts suffering at about f3.6. The FZ200, with its f2.8 lens can take advantage of most of the density of the chip throughout its zoom range. At 8 mpix., you can take some advantage of the resolution, even at f4. At 5 mpix., that extends to f5.6.Compare this with the current model Canon SX50HS, which has a 24-1200mm zoom, ranging from f3.4 wide angle, to f6.5 at the long end. At 12 mpix., with an f3.4 exposure, the SX50 will yield an image with most of the subtle detail gone. Zoom this thing, and your pixels come up increasingly empty. At 5.9 mpix., the camera can take full advantage of the lens at wide angle only. At 1.9 mpix., you still run into diffraction issues at 1200mm.You pay a lot of money for an FZ200. You pay for the lens. Ah, the lens: It gives you greater resolution, especially at the telephoto end. It gives you greater light grasp, allowing you to shoot at lower ISOs. Lower ISOs mean lower noise. You get to play more with depth of field. F2.8 blurs the background; with a 1/2.3" chip, f5.6 brings much of the image into focus.In a camera world with increasingly wild camera claims, the FZ200 stands out as a fairly honest camera. It actually delivers most of what the specifications promise. Such cameras are getting hard to find.Update 21 October, 2013: I have kept dialing back the sharpening and the noise reduction settings. They both are now set at -2 (the lowest setting). The camera is quite sharp at these settings, as the lens can truly deliver the resolution at these settings. Unless I am shooting distant bird shots, I shoot at 8 megapixels, varying the aperture between f2.8 and f3.5.I wish the camera had an ISO 50 setting, as the camera will not shoot faster than 1/2000 of a second using aperture priority, or the "P" setting. If I shoot at 12 megapixels, I want to shoot at full aperture, but I find I frequently need a faster shutter speed. Changing to shutter priority yields 1/3200 of a second, which almost does it. It's a bit of a clunky arrangement. So, I stay at 8 megapixels, two megapixels higher than my SX10IS, and a get great deal more resolution than those extra pixels would indicate. The sharpness of this camera takes one's breath away.

$review_text.: I had an old 120GB Elite HD sitting around and was looking to save some money. Rather than fork out another $100 for the bigger HD when I was buying an Xbox, I bought this thing instead, took apart the enclosure for the old HD and popped it into this thing. Whole thing took about 10 minutes- and that was because I couldn't find where I put my toolbox.Works like a charm!If you are looking to save some money and have an old 1st gen 360 Hard drive sitting around, or can pick one up cheap from someplace, and want to use it in a newer Xbox 360-E or Xbox 360-S buy this and make sure you have a set of TORX screwdrivers so you can actually remove the HD from the old enclosure.The only weird thing about this enclosure is that on the little tab sticking out the side it says 240GB so it looks like your system is a 240GB just from physically inspecting it. Of course, checking in the console setting will tell you the actual size (I'm using a 120GB)

$REVIEW.: Owned a Brite-View 3100, and wanted to buy another media player

 Learned that this Zinwell is Brite-View's cousin, so decided to buy one because we had quite good experiences with the Brite-View

 Unit came and looked very stylish, which fit pretty well with our other black-colored equipment under the TV


 Connection to TV was easy, and the menu was so easy to navigate


 We tested a few video formats and all played well
 The only problem we found was that it could not display subtitles for DVD ISO files - in contrast, the Brite-View unit can
 But this is rather a minor thing, as we store all of our DVD collection in mp4 without subtitles anyhow


 Haven't tried the network features yet - not sure whether a regular wireless adapter for a few bucks would do, or have to purchase the special Zinwell adapter for $19.99; also have read some negative reviews on network play, so decided not to venture out for now.Overall a good purchase
 We are satisfied with it.

$REVIEW.: Bought this MSI to save on my budget. I priced out an alienware, read the review's blah blah. Buying a laptop I needed not only for my graphic design, but video editing, needed to be mobile, needed something fast. I do a lot of odd jobs throughout the workday. I was dead set on an alienware for the look's and the cooling system (A good 80% of the computer problems I see with laptops is heat dissipation). I opted to go with the MSI for this reason. I got the same specs of the other brand for $600 dollars less. Which was nice considering I was already anxious about buying a $2000 laptop in the first place. After the first month of having this the heat registry is right on par. I can hear the fan come on, but even in a quiet work setting doing full video editing it is not that loud. If you want the Ferrari because of the name get the alienware, If you want the supra that beat's the Ferrari, get the MSI.
$SUMMARY.: MSI beats alienware in my pocketbook.

$review_text.: I bought this Nabi for my granddaughter's sixth birthday. This wasn't exactly divine inspiration on my part though last year I bought her a Leap Frog tablet for her fifth birthday. I told my grandchild to make a list of things she wanted for her birthday and Christmas. She and her parents went to FAO Schwartz, American Girl Place, Best Buy, and a few other tech stores. Her parents and I looked at all the tablets currently available, and compared them and read the reviews. The Nabi was at the top of the list, but all adults involved had reservations regarding a movement away from traditional learning as well as questioning the versatility of this tablet. I ended up taking her to the store and watched her take this on a test ride. The image is crisp and bright; surprisingly so considering it's for kids. I've seen adult tablets that aren't all that great. It has plenty of add ons for learning modules that will help teach math skills, etc. that mimics and reinforces the skills she is learning in school, but it also has plenty of apps that come preloaded. It can be used as a ereader, is portable, and solid with a heavy rubberized case. While this isn't my iPad, this is a very nice tablet and extremely kid friendly. Ouite honestly, I'd rather that she have her own tablet instead of going after the adults tablets which really aren't appropriate for children.Of course, when my granddaughter opened her present she was in kid heaven. According to her parents, they now limit her time on the Nabi and she never uses it before she finishes her homework and practices her penmanship. They are already noticing an improvement in her math skills and notice that she is really enjoying the games and reading materials that are available as well as the educationally based apps.She is very careful when she handles this, but the power cord seems a little flimsy. That is about the only criticism that I have regarding this product. This is a great product that has seems to have solid educational value and offers a lot for the $150 I paid for it. It is cute and is a perfect entry level tablet that can sneakily educate while still being entertaining. Best yet, it can grow with the child and his/hers needs.If you are considering buying this for a kid, I suggest you read the specs and a couple of the top rated customer reviews here. They are detailed and technical and focus on the positives and possible negatives. Compare this with comparable products regarding the features and specs and most definitely check this out at a store. What surprised me when I took my grandkid to the store was how quickly she took to it. She's bright and definitely electronic savvy and very much into school, but she breezed through this at the store and told me what she liked about it. Ultimately, that's what sold us on this toy. It melds technology with basic learning and makes it fun.

The wire that connects to the USB and the 30 pin is really cheaply made.  After a while the 30 pin that connects to the cord wears out and I guess disconnects from the part that goes into the ipad.  I am disappointed, no problem with the USB end, to the charger.  I expected a better made cable and did not expect it to stop working based on a connection problem with the cable. I would not buy this again.There are other cables more compatible and made better.  I originally bought this because the cable you get with ipad is so short and this way I could still use my ipad while it charged. Now I am trying a 3 ft cable with another company.

$REVIEW.: I've had a love/hate relationship with my original Bose IE earphones: love the way they sound, hate the way they (don't) fit. Also hated the too-long cord and the way the silicon earpieces popped off at the slightest touch. I tended not too use the old IEs because of these drawbacks as well as the lack of volume/track control, since I most often listen to music via iPhone and iPad (ahem, Apple Lossless, of course). I finally decided to spring for the MIE2i earphones and very glad I did. They solve the design shortcomings of the original version.  Dare I say they are near-perfect?There are several earphones now that have the iPhone control buttons, but most are in-the-ear-canal design, which I find too isolating for being out in the world (dog walking, bike riding).  I'll still use the standard Apple earbuds for sweaty activities like running, but these Bose earphones will be in my ears the rest of the time, they're sublime.The only goofy thing: what the f/h were they thinking with the gargantuan case? That thing is as big as my iPhone! Literally, I can easily fit my iPhone in the case with room to spare. The old wind-on case was better, even though it was a bit of a pain to wind the cord on it, it did prevent cord tangles.

$REVIEW.: I had to get another case for my computer the power button went out and couldn't be replaced. I decided on this case, and I'll tell you what a great choice I made. There is alot of room, easily to install and connect wiring. Installing the Hard drives and DVD abd Bluray drives was a snap. Everything u need to install comes with the case. I know some will grip about no power supply coming with it but I had just bought one and didn't need it. The Supply I had fit right in and I like it being on the bottom. Another feature I enjoy are the temp reading after I figured out where to place them. That is the only problem, it does not come with instructions on placing the parts for the tempature and the otherparts for the HDDs and SSDs. If you don't have a tech brain you may need a little help. But very little. This is a great case and very easy to work on. GREAT PRICING for it.

$review_text.: In all seriousness, Sonos puts out a great product.  From un-boxed to playing music was just under fifteen minutes.  If there are every any hiccups, the bridge is super easy to pair again with mobile devices.The only hitch (that other people have mentioned) is that the vile scum of the earth cable company that starts with C and rhymes with Pomcast does not allow you to link directly with their wireless router.  Die in a fire, Comcast.  If you are going straight to your wireless router and Comcast is your cable/internet provider, you do need another wireless router for the bridge to go through.  Easy fix, but if your Sonos system arrives ten minutes before all of your guests do for PartyPalooza '14... you may be disappointed if you hook up to your Comcast router and nothing happens.  But, if you use Comcast, you are used to disappointment anyway so there is that.

$REVIEW.: Corsair power supplies are just amazing. I have never had an issue with one. I use this particular model (the TX series) in my customer builds. It is very efficient (Bronze rating) and very quiet. Never had a failure with one of these, or a surge problem. I think Corsair just takes an off the shelf power supply design from Seasonic or another power supply manufacturer, and adds some of their own design features. The cables are all sheathed, which is nice, although that makes them not very flexible. The cables also have good length. If I could change one thing on this power supply, it might be just to use those newer style of cables that are thin and flexible, which makes for easier cable management. But that is a minor nitpick of mine. If you want a nice power supply, this one I highly recommend!

$REVIEW.: After seeing the prices being asked for other adjustable wall mounts, I shopped around until I found this one on Amazon


 It had good reviews so I figured I would give it a try
 Thank goodness I did, as this was exactly what I was looking for at a very affordable price

 Instructions were simple but clear, and all the hardware needed to install was included, plus some

 Only thing that is worth pointing out is that you will want to be sure you have a wall stud in the middle of where you want your TV installed due to this installing on a single stud.

Like the 2 adapters for connecting to computers (laptops, etc.) when necessary, though now we have USB cables to sync phones, so won't need them for the phones.  But, work nice for the camera micro-sd when transferring photos.  No need for cable when on the road.

The problem is that the factory radio had better reception than this one. Yes, the stations still come in and they sound good when they do, but I've noticed when there are a lot of tall buildings around or other interfering environmental factors, there's a lot more static. I wouldn't say I regret my choice, but you might want to research something else.

$review_text.: This is the BEST surge protector I have and not because its great looking and easy to clean.The package notes it has 12 outlets, an 8 ft cord, and a low profile plug which caught my attention. Since my outlet is six feet from my desk area and the other surge protector I had. Because of the wider spacing between each plug outlet you can actually plug in larger plugs which on my old surge only allowed me to use every other outlet on the surge protector.And for those of us who have high speed or satellite computer hook ups we want something that in winter or summer power failures wont spike and burn the surge protector when the power comes back on..  As well as your phone line if plugged in like for cordless phones. I also like that each outlet has a safety set up. Also lets you know if the wall outlet you have it plugged into is grounded or not. And unlike other surge protectors this one is great and safer as far as allowing clear screen visuals and sounds.  Which if you have HD big screen tv set ups is a must in my view.Oh...and it has a LIFETIME warranty (none of the others I have do this). And it has a continuous use rating of 125v/15a60Hz/1875w  For those who have their laptop on all day this is important.  And the power switch is bigger and easier to reach when I want to shut the system off per phantom power load issues.  Or if you have visual problems its easier to actually find the switch in less light.Recommend it for anyone who has electrical items they value and don't want to replace because of a power mess up.  Am actually going to buy a couple more.UPDATE  January 20 2014Still love and recommend this item.  Has given us NO problems at all since we got it in 2011.

$review_text.: As part of my particiaption in the Amazon Vines program I received this product for a review.I've purchased other capacitive stylus brands before at the local big box stores


 (My daughters have a knack for losing them.)  Most are priced in this range for a single stylus

 It's a definite advantage to have a 3 pack

 I like the plastic piece that fits into the stereo jack to hold it because the case I purchased with my new Kindle Fire HD does not have a spot in the case to hold the stylus.Functionally, they do the job and I am pleased with them

 The tip is "spongy" and not stiff

 Considering my daughters ability to lose these things, I suspect I will be buying this product again in the future
4 out of 5 stars.

$review_text.: LOVE this lens.  This is great for the type of work that I do (weddings).  It's my favorite lens and the best for portraits by far for the money (the next best is probably $6,000).  As you'll see in other reviews online, the auto focus is VERY slow in a dark situation.  Outdoors and in well lit rooms, this isn't a problem though.  There are a ton of reviews out there on this lens, so i can't add much other than to say it was worth every penny I paid for it.

$review_text.: It comes in a little rounded bottle with caps at both ends.  The bottom contains a micro-fiber cloth and the top is the spray bottle for the cleaning fluid.  The packaging really didn't impress me.  As a matter of fact, it kind of annoys me that the rounded caps on both ends makes it nearly impossible to stand this product upright...  however...  I didn't get it for the fancy packaging, I got it to clean screens.  It does a decent job with that.  I've cleaned my computer monitor and the touch screen of my iPad with it and in both cases it performed as well as every other product I've ever used for that purpose.  Why the 4 stars?  I've always tended to be more interested in performance than appearance... and it did a decent job... not perfect... but good.  If you buy it I hope you are happy with it and thanks for taking the time to read my review.

$review_text.: Picked up for under forty during Black Friday, this LG brand Blu-ray player with Wifi, 3D capabilities and the ability to stream Vudu and Netflix, is a bare bones option that works.  You will not get high-end features at with this player, but you will get a Blu-ray disk player that upconverts standard DVDs to 1080p, can play 3D content, has a USB 2.0 port and Wifi.  That's pretty good at this price point!Have your wifi and Netflix passwords handy when you set this player up, so you can input the info to get things started.  You will also need a HDMI cable (not included).  I recommendAmazonBasics 2-Pack, High-Speed HDMI Cables 6.5 feet -- Supports Ethernet, 3D, and Audio Return [Newest Standard] which gives you a spare, and is probably the best deal on HDMI cables that consistently work well that I've found.  You may also want to have some batteries on standby, if the batteries that ship with the remote are DOA.I'm pleased with this player for the price I paid. It's not complicated to use, and it works.  I have had good luck with LG branded products in the past, and would recommend this player if you can get it for under fifty dollars.The fact that it streams Netflix and has wifi make it a really good option for a bedroom player, or for someone who doesn't want or need lots of apps.  I do wish it had Amazon and HuluPlus too, but frankly, that just seems greedy at this point.NOTE: You will not see 3D pictures without a 3D capable TV and 3D glasses (not included), but you will be able to enjoy Blu-ray high definition (1080p) with a compatible HDTV capable of 1080p.NOTE: In order to enjoy Netflix and Vudu you have to subscribe to their various services.TIP Regarding Building Blu-ray Movie Collection:  I found that many 'Region Free' Blu-ray movie collections on Amazon UK to be cheaper (even with international shipping and exchange rates) than on Amazon US!  The Bourne movies, Lethal Weapon, Harry Potter 1-8 and more, are all less.  A great way to build your Blu-ray collection is using 'region free' movies.  What that means is that the discs will play all over the world in Blu-ray players that are not specifically designed for individual countries.UPDATE: 1/2/13If you want to know all the specs on this product, go to LG dot com and search for LG BP335W.  You will get the complete specs on this product including playable audio and video formats.UPDATE: 1/5/13When you set-up the player, be sure to go into Settings and Update the drivers. The player will shut off, and you may need to press the Power button on the remote to restart, which will install the driver.  Then set-up your Wifi connection via the remote (which comes with 1 AAA battery). Don't worry if you have already set up your player's Wifi.  Just check periodically for updates to keep the player current and performing at its best.The user interface on this player is very easy to use.  Almost seems too simple.  But it works quickly and without a fuss, which I very much like.I also like that if I stop the player at a certain point in a movie, then come back and turn it back on, the movie restarts in the same place I left it.  I love it! ( A higher end Blu-ray player by Sony that I own always goes back to the main menu which can be very frustrating.)I'm using this player in my daughter's room with aLG Electronics LAP340 SoundPlate Slim 4.1 Surround Sound Speaker System with Built-In Sub Woofer and Bluetoothand a Vizio brand HDTV.  The combination is great, and the player's compact size made integrating it very easy to do.  She also has herRoku LT Streaming Media Player (Purple) (2700R) (2013 Version)hooked up to stream Amazon Instant Video and get HuluPlus.UPDATE: 4/23/14This player is a good one for those who are like me and don't have cable TV, but still have wireless internet. Use the apps to get additional programming in combination with FREE over-the-air TV. If you're not sure how that works, check out my book:Simple Guide to Over-the-Air Free TV.

$review_text.: I purchased one of the original iPod Nano's when they first came out and loved the form factor and function. However, a couple of years ago, Apple recalled these 1st generation models due to battery problems and offered to replace it with the current (at the time) 6th generation Nano. My original one had 2 Gb storage and the new one had 16Gb. I decided to return my 1st gen and received my replacement 6th gen a few weeks later.I was somewhat happy with the new design changes in that the 6th gen Nano now incorporated a touchscreen, but was not too keen on the size. The old versions (and now current generation) could easily be controlled with one hand, but the 6th gen seemed to more difficult to operate one-handed. I used this Nano for a couple of years and came across this watch strap accessory on Amazon recently and thought this a very interesting way to use an iPod.I received this band and was instantly impressed with the quality, craftsmanship, fit, and feel of the product. The Nano easily snapped into the frame and is securely held in place. The band is very supple and not made of cheap materials (like those found in discount stores) and the buckle has a fine finish that is easily manipulated with one hand while strapping it to your wrist. It also incorporates a nifty, adjustable catch that holds the loose end of the band securely against the strap.I mainly use my Nano to listen to music while reading or dozing off to sleep with nature sounds or white noise in the evening. Having my Nano strapped to my wrist keeps it from tumbling into the dark recesses of my recliner or wrapped around comforter and pillow overnight. I don't really use it while walking or running, but the strap does come in handy as I can wrap it around my mountain bike or stationary bike handle while I'm riding.I am quite pleased with this accessory and the discounted price (since the Nano it fits is no longer current) makes this an exceptional bargain considering the fine quality of the product.

$review_text.: I happened to casually be surfing along here at Amazon when I thought I would check the price on what my years old Bearcat BCT15  now sells for.  I see that this fine scanner is now down well below $200. What a bargain for a top flight radio!Then I started reading the reviews and I just could not believe how many &#8220;bad reviews&#8221; this scanner got from people that obviously have gotten in way over their head.Here's the correct poop:1.) No one programs any of these advanced scanners from the front panel !  You use programming software on your PC and and then download the settings to the Bearcat using a USB cable. Just Google &#8220;programming software BCT15&#8221; and you will find out in a hurry where to obtain the necessary item.

$REVIEW.: This is an amazing graphics card! However, for almost 1,100 USD, it's something you have to deeply consider, unless you're you got cash to spend :o)Right, anyways. I've tested this card on demanding games such as BF3, Metro 2033, Crysis 2, Assassins Creed Revelations, Black Ops, MW3, Mass Effect 3, and Syndicate.With BF3 I get anywhere from 140-180 FPS (max resolution of 2560x1600)Metro 2033 Max Resolution 2560x1600 Highest Graphics, FPS of 70-95 (tested once)Anyways, I've stressed this card multiple times for hours. It doesn't heat up if you're good with fan management in the case. Gameplay is always smooth with this GPU.Pricey, but this card delivers.Design : 5/5Graphics : 5/5Heat : 5/5Installation : 5/5Overall, a great card. Like I said the only downfall of this card is its price.

 It connected very nicely out of the box
 I connected it to my WRT54GS Linksys Router

 Sometimes the laptop itself can block the signal, but that is to be expected as the Thinkpad has a Magnesium shell

$REVIEW.: Ignore the posts that say this sub is underpowered--unless you still get carded when you order a drink.  If you are looking for something to thump the floor during movies and carry the bass line in pop, jazz or classical music, you can't go wrong.  This is a step up from the bottom rung of Polk's subs, and you will be glad you ponied up a bit more money.  It can actually contribute to the MUSIC you may want to hear--nice, clear bass.  But I have had to back waaaay off on the volume of this sub because it can dominate the whole HT setup if you aren't careful.  The floor moves.  The neighbors will comment.  The dogs will run and hide.  There is plenty of power here for all your home theater and gaming needs.  If you need more than this to feel the earth move, go live a little.  Come back in ten years.  We can talk then.

$review_text.: I had never owned an Asus branded optical drive before so I wasn't sure what to expect, but this has turned out to be the best travel drive I've owned so far


I think the pictures are a bit deceptive, because in reality this drive is MUCH thinner than the product images would lead you to believe, and also much sleeker and very attractive


The stand that comes with it is, of course, optional and I don't personally use it
In order to attach the stand, there is a rubber piece on the bottom of the drive which must be removed to reveal a slot, and then the stand snaps securely into that slot, holding the drive up on it's side in a very stable position


If you opt not to use it, as I have done, the rubber piece stays in and sits flush against the bottom


Using it lying flat isn't a problem, because there are four rubber feet on the bottom that prevent it from sliding around and the rubber slot cover acts as a fifth foot helping to make it that much more stable
There are a couple of huge pluses that need to be mentioned about this drive

I previously owned a similar travel drive from another well known manufacturer, and while it was reasonably small, it also required an external power source of it's own meaning you had an extra cable to carry with you
That is not the case with this drive


It is powered entirely via the USB connector and has so far been extremely reliable

The drive I owned previously was a little picky about defects in CDs and other optical discs, and I don't know if it is the firmware in the Asus drive or the reading mechanism itself, but the error correction in reading discs is far better than it was with my old drive and therefore much more forgiving when I'm ripping some of my older CDs that have seen better days to my hard drive (I primarily use it with Sound Juicer in Ubuntu Linux)
I have burned close to 100 ISO images to CDR discs with this drive using Brasero and only had one coaster, and that was probably my fault as I had put a label on the disc that was off center and also had a crease in it before I tried to burn it, so it's kind of hard to blame the drive for that as the disc itself was most probably off balance


I've also had to use it as a boot drive a couple of times and it was always recognized by the BIOS on my Eee PC 1000HA on startup
Read and write speeds are also very similar to my old drive as well.So if you're looking for a compact, reliable and attractive travel drive in this price range, you can pretty much stop looking right now


This drive has just about everything you could ask for from a portability standpoint

I have no complaints whatsoever about this drive or it's performance
It's taken nearly everything I've fed it so far without issue, and I have no qualms whatsoever about giving it five stars
Surprisingly great product.

$REVIEW.: The Sanyo Xacti VPC-E2 Digital Camcorder and 8 MP Digital Camera is sort of a multi-tool approach to still and video cameras. It does a huge number of things that other more expensive cameras do, and does them fairly well.  The thick instruction manual reflects the versatility and complexity of the Xacti.  There are several good reviews of this camera on Amazon, so I will not repeat the technical details already contained in these reviews.The Xacti takes one hour of 640x480 movies per gigabyte of SD card. There is no HD mode.  Since 8 GB cards are readily available, you can get 8 hours of movies on one card. The small battery will not last that long, and may not last even 1 hour. A second non-oem battery may be obtained for less than $20. However, for most things one hour of movies is enough unless you are a pro and plan to do considerable editing.  In addition to movies,the Xacti takes 8 MP still images of good quality, and you can take a still while taking movies.  Both movies and stills have access to a 5x optical zoom that seems to be fairly accurate over its entire range.  Focus is good and quick. Movies are good at fairly low light levels, and stills can use the built-in flash where needed. As with most cameras, brighter lighting produces better pictures.  The ISO values increase to compensate for dim light, but the noise level becomes noticeable at ISO levels above 400 for still pictures. Noise levels in movies is not noticeable. I have now used the camera in movie mode in a child's birthday party in very dim indoor light. The results were quite good.The camera has a very good macro capability that permits good focus down to about 0.5 inches. This feature can be a lot of fun or can be simply useful for recording extreme detail. I have now used this feature to copy old 35 mm color slides by placing them on an inexpesnive light box and photographing them. The Xacti does a good job.The fact that the camera is waterproof to a rated 5 feet means that you can safely use this at the beach or poolside where there is a lot of splashing.  Underwater photography seems to be an interesting application, but I have not tried that (it's winter now).Picture and movie playback are easy using either the included USB cable (non-standard) or by moving the SD card directly to your PC using a card reader (my preferred method). The quality is surprisingly good from such a small camera. Zoomed images were sharply focused. There is some small delay in focusing when tracking objects, but this is not a problem in most situations. The large rotating view screen is a pleasure to use for taking pictures and for playing them back. When taking movies, the sound quality during playback is quite good.The included case is almost useless. Throw it away and get another small carry case (less than $10).Overall, I think the user will be pleased with the camera in a wide variety of situations.

$review_text.: I'm genuinely amazed at the clever strategies Synology has put in place to bypass the complexity involved in accomplishing typical tasks with NAS'. They have very simple wizards that allow you to go straight to using the thing for what you need, instead what most NAS interfaces of this caliber do: drowning in jargon and ridiculous labyrinthine indecipherable nonsense of use to no one, and that gets you nowhere and offer no clue how to do anything.Synology simplified it all--better still, they offer their own version of RAID called SHR that is automatic, gives you the speed of striping, the security of mirroring, and it works like a toaster. You don't have to know anything at all. You just click it and it configures itself.Having torn out most of my hair over the years, and blown out my pupil countless times from the frustration stroke most products with these features have forced me to endure, I've resolved that anytime a company makes their product respectful of the user's time, I'll sing it's praises. It's so rare. I can see why their products have the highest ratings of all NAS' on amazon.Way to go!

The Studio is easy to assemble and provides all the light I need. Using the studio allows me to take my photos at any time of the day.  I used to have a very limited time during the day by my window, and the light was often very inadequate. The light on the MS20 can be adjusted very easily, up or down, depending on the height of the object you are photographing.  I suggest that you play the installation video while assembling the MS20, as it explains everything in detail and makes the assembly easy-peasy.

$review_text.: I purchased this system mainly because of the integrated monitor and its small size. I absolutely love that it's literally a plug-and-play system.  Install the cameras, plug them into the main unit, plug it in and it's working.  The set-up instructions are good and easy to follow.  I also like the being able to either use the included mouse or remote to control the various functions.  I had a hard time when I tried to saving a specific event to the USB drive, but without reading the instructions (I'm a man for crying out loud) I figured it out in about 20 minutes.  Fortunately, I have Windows dual-booted on my iMac so I can take advantage of the USB drive... otherwise, I would be stuck.  Please make software for Mac OS X, it kills me to boot Windows!  Anyway, this is a great product for the average person who wants a basic CCTV system.  Two draw backs are the it isn't expandable and it's pretty loud.  Other than that, no buyers remorse here.

$review_text.: I've used a few other in-ear headsets, and this is my favorite hands-down
 The construction is top notch, with the aluminum drivers being super small (and therefore super comfortable) yet solid and easy to grasp


 The cord does a better job of resisting tangles than my Z-Buds while looking and feeling much better
 As others have mentioned, it could afford to be a bit longer, but I haven't had any difficulties with the length

 The mic and button work fine, with good sound quality and ease of use even while working in the yard with heavy gloves on.As for sound quality, the break-in makes a big difference

 You CANNOT judge these without breaking them in!  The sound has been rounding out nicely and continues to improve, but does not quite deliver the heavy bass I've enjoyed with my Skull Candies


 (some folks dislike too much bass, so this is a matter of taste)  Still, there is plenty of range to enjoy various music styles
 No complaints here.My only caveat is that I had the same difficulty with the provided silicone "pads" not quite fitting properly

 This is a subjective detail, as every ear is unique...but I find it interesting that so many--myself included--are unable to get comfy with the included pads


 I happened to have a spare pair of foam-style pads from another headset

 I put those on this pair of J3M's, and they are now BY FAR the most comfortable ear buds I've ever worn!  I know foam pads can be found for purchase separately, and think that buying some along with a set of JBud J3M's would still be worthwhile

 However, I think JBuds would do well to consider adding some foam pads to the included collection
 They make for a tight seal (better sound), better comfort and a firm fit that never leaves me feeling like a bud might fall out.

$REVIEW.: I've had this player for about a month now. I am very happy with how it works. I had a friend who is more computer savvy than me set it up. He had no problems. The picture quality is stunning. I use it for Netflix and my own regular DVDs and all is well. I am going slowly into the other options. YouTube plays fine but getting used to the remote for this can take some time. I usually watch YouTube on my home computer anyway. I'm more into (older) movies. My 1st day or two I needed a little tech support and they were very helpful at LG & Netflix. I got this unit at a very low price but feel even since the price has gone up some this is well worth the price. When my cable package runs out I will downsize to local stations only and go stay with Netflix. The monthly savings will pay for this player in about 3 1/2 months. I would rather choose what to watch than settle for what is on - and I don't have to pay for a DVR. Very happy indeed. A+.

$REVIEW.: Over the past two weeks, in an attempt to get USB 3.0 working on my 5.1, mid-2013 Mac Pro (purchased the same day the Black Cylinder was announced) running OSX 10.8.5, I purchased and installed the Orico and CalDigit cards. Neither worked, with Bluetooth interference, kernel panics, corrupted Suitcase Font Vault issues, etc.The RocketU 1144CM card was apparently compatible with Mac Pro and Mountain Lion. I was willing to accept the fact that the card would only work with Hard Drives. All of the drives mounted, and I was able to write to them, but I was immediately bedeviled by the cursor of my "Magic Mouse" (the one that ships with my Mac Pro), moving in a jerky, and slow fashion. I downloaded a more recent driver from the High Point website. Same result.I am returning the card, because I need Bluetooth working, and I like my Magic Mouse. Very disappointing result, because I was hoping that this card would work, where the Orico and CalDigit failed.I did see there is a later version of the card, the 1144E. I really wish I had known about that first, but I am unwilling to try to install a fourth card, since I suspect the result will be the same.I would love to know if anyone has experienced the same Bluetooth issues, and solved them.

$REVIEW.: I frequently use portable hard drive enclosures to copy and/or transport 2.5&#34; drives.  I love this one because it is durable and compact and works well.  A great bonus is that it has a latch to hold the unit closed without needing screws.  I change the drive inside too frequently to want to screw and unscrew the cap so I usually just end up losing the screws and having a unit that won't stay closed.  This one is excellent and doesn't have that problem.

$REVIEW.: I've been a big user of recordable DVD's over the last 2 years ever since my son was born.  Making home movie DVD's and copying all the digital pictures for family members requires more space than the traditional CD-R's.  I have never purchased blank media from Amazon before as I prefer (Ok...was forced) to buy very specific brands and I could never tell which brands Amazon was selling (I'll explain this in a bit).  I decided to give these a try as Amazon doesn't typically "brand" their own products outside of the Kindle.  I assume we will be seeing more Amazon branded stuff in the future...kind of like your grocery store brand.All of the blank DVD's I was forced to use in the past have been "made in Japan" discs.  Coming from various online forums where various trading (ROIO....look it up on Google) took place, you were forced to use Japan made media or you ran the risk of being banned for future trades.  The belief was that the dye used in Japan made discs was a higher quality than the dye used in discs made in Taiwan (the low cost producer of blank media at that time).  This resulted in better quality, less errors on burns and better longevity.  The main brand recommended was Taiyo Yuden and you could either buy these as their own generic brand or, if you were lucky, in the store under various mainstream brands such as Sony and TDK.  You were forced to look at the "made in" area of the packaging to determine where they were made since they sometimes had Japan made and Taiwan made in the same sections.  Whether or not this "Japan made" media was better...I'll never know or care to understand.  In the end, I got just as many coasters with my Taiyo Yudens as I did with my old cheapo Ritek's.Since most of my burning is for discs I will keep, I left the more expensive area and have been trying to find discs that are cheap but well made.  While Taiwan was the cheaper option in the past, it appears that China is now taking on that role.  The Amazon branded discs are "made in China".  These are the first discs I have used that are made somewhere else besides Japan and Taiwan.I have made 10 discs so far ranging from data discs to full on DVD backups.  So far my Sony DVD re-writer has had no issues with burning to these discs using programs like Nero, Windows Media Player and Windows Movie Maker.  All of the discs have worked in my DVD player and PS3 with no issues.  I can't speak to how reliable these will be over time since they are fairly new but at least they burned with no issue.I ran each of the discs through Nero Disc Check/Speed disc and they had no issues with read/write speeds.  By the end of the test, I was able to achieve just under the 16X speed (although I never burn that fast).  I ran file checks and surface scan and found zero errors.  This is quite unusual as even my more expensive discs would have maybe one bad sector on average.  So as of right now, these discs are coming up flawless.  I have a lot more to use so hopefully my error rate will remain low with these discs....or in a perfect world....I'll get no errors out of the 100 discs.As for the price, about $20 for 100 discs is a great price.  I used to pay about $40 to $50 for 100 Japan made discs plus shipping.  Even the cheaper Taiwan made discs cost me about $30 per 100 so this is  a great price from Amazon.My only gripes are the following (and these have nothing to do with the quality of the discs)1. Amazon - Why send me a box big enough to fit a car what the discs are already in a nice small box?  Just throw a label on the small box and save some money on your part.2. I prefer my media to be label free on the disc itself.  I don't know if Amazon sells these but it's a personal preference on my part.Assuming my future burns go as well as the first 10, I will continue buying the Amazon branded media.

$REVIEW.: I've used a few hard drive enclosures and this is the first that requires screws. That makes it a more permanent enclosure than others. That's okay. I'm using it for an old 2.5" hard drive that I need to turn into an external hard drive. It works well. I backed up all my photos from my Windows 7 computer onto it, and all went smoothly.The enclosure comes with the necessary cable and a pouch. It's polished and attractive. I like it, but I don't think it would be good for someone who needs to constantly swap hard drives out. The screws make that inconvenient.This product was provided for review by Sabrent.

$REVIEW.: When I think of computer speakers, I think of my college days. This was in the heyday of Audiogalaxy where everyone had access to as many 128kpps MP3's they wanted. This culminated in a lot of poorly-encoded music played loudly on adequate $30 speakers. It was well understood that computers could play music but unless you had a high-end bose system, pc's were not worthy enough to be part of the 'audio system' realm. It seemed there would always be a divide between the two.Up until a few months ago, I was touring the above-average-for-computer-speakers circuit with a $70 Creative 2.1 system. After an unfortunate wiring mishap, I found myself looking for a replacement. Yada yada yada, I went with these Klipsch speakers and here's what impressed me:Power: The power is mostly what makes these on par with a home audio setup. The impressive 200 watts the system offers is MORE THAN ENOUGH for a dorm room/office/media room. I am actually running these as my main front speakers in my regular surround setup and they are more than holding their own.Clarity: The subwoofer provides a very nice, tight bass. A noticeable upgrade from my normal subwoofer. The satellite speakers do a great job with music and sounded absolutely gorgeous when I put on Transformers w/ Dolby Digital. The clarity and separation of the individual instruments/voices really stands out. This is particularly powerful when you're listening from a couple feet away. You'll hear things you never heard before. Also, the system is THX-certified which I assume is a pretty positive thing.Construction: I'm no carpenter but all the pieces are solid and heavy and look pretty well constructed. Klipsch is renowned for quality so I don't imagine having any problems.Features: Volume/Subwoofer control on satellite speaker; aux in (for ipod/zune) and headphone directly on speaker;Cost-Benefit: Computer speakers are an afterthought in many people's minds so spending over $100 might seem a bit extreme to some. If you're in need of replacement or looking to upgrade though, these look like the best match of value and quality. If you go with the $50 range, you get limited dorm room type power (5 watts/satt), the $100 range affords much more (35 watts/satt); The extra money is worth the flexibility and quality. Even played at a low volume, the sound is MUCH better than what I'm used to. Also, there's a few models in this price range that look pretty good (Altec-Lansing, Logitech), make sure to check those out too.

$REVIEW.: This is a great way to protect your Zune 80/120

 The rubberized case is very strudy and the provides a lot of protection for the case
However, the hard plastic cover for the screen that is included is worthless
 There are no instructions for how to put it on your screen and it tends to trap every piece of dust under it
 You cannot easily lift off the screen cover once installed so you have to get it right the first time


I ended up trashing the cover and used an old Palm screen cover that fitted the Zune screen perfectly.Again, the case itself is superior and just what I needed to protect my Zune while traveling


Well worth the price


However, forget the included screen cover.

$REVIEW.: I have a big floor and bookshelf  speakers 5.1 home theater system, now it was in a smaller room and in the new room the  orignal cable was a bit short and visible so I wanted to replace the cable that it will look cleaner so I bought this, I rewired the whole system and it looked great,I ran out of wire exactly for the left surround,so I said I will buy another one but first I tested the sound and it was bad,the center sounded extremely muffled and the detail was lacking ,I read that for a short distance its better to go with thicker wire, my old ones are about 10 guage for the front mains and center and 18 guage for surrounds, now in the center channel I heard a lot of the quiet detail and the voices sounded real and natural with the old cable , for example: the fifth element when it goes from the music to when he calculates how time there is until evil arrives and he likes whispers numbers and when there is s in something somebody says and the mid woofers blend in very well with tweeter, with this cable all that detail was completely gone,on the fronts it made them tinny and the treble was very very low and the was a echo, I ended up returning the old ones for the fronts and center and I used this only for the 2 surrounds at the end, the surrounds sound fine, my suggestion is buy this only if you have one of those home theater in a box packages with small speakers,you should replace that string thin cable because with small speakers this would make a good difference, I specificly wanted to try the rca wire but I won't make that mistake again,next time Im going to buy speaker cables its from a hardware store like lowes or home depot..

$REVIEW.: I've had my Transformer for awhile now (like 6 months) before deciding to get the keyboard dock. When I ordered my Transformer tablet I didn't think I would want the dock. But months later I have changed my mind. I found myself holding the Transformer for long periods and felt I needed some kind of holder for it. I also started researching and watchng what other people were saying about havng the dock and specially its extra battery life added to my Transformer.I love having th keyboard dock added to my tablet. It also helps me with easy typing. The virtual keyboard is very hard to type with when you want to type for longr than a few words. This helps tremendously. The keyboard also helps with editing and typing using Polaris Office that comes pre-installed on the tabalet. It works well with Microsoft Office and you an edit and type up documents thats can been used on the tablet. I also love the many ports that come with the dock. You get two usb ports and a full sized sd card slot. I've connected and edited a few documents on it. I also got this dock on sale when I oreded it n Black Friday. Love it.The only thing that I don't like it the added wight to th tablet. It is very heavy to carry. But I can over look that.

$review_text.: This does what it says it does with one exception it will not conect to a cell phone, I have a G2 cell phone and it will not conect to it because the keyboard generatesits own pin cide that you have to punch in on the keyboard and the numbers are random and the older cell phones do not display the number, how ever that being said it does connect to the sony PS# and I have a lenovo K1 and it conects to that, both with complete ease that keyboard feels solid abd the keys with the new scisore action feels again solid and comfortable the instrutions are clear and persise the only thing and it is minore at best is the control pad is clunky with the tablet, like I said a very minore thing all in all this is worth the money it is worth the buy

$REVIEW.: Not a bad headset. Nothing fancy, works well.Comes in a rigid plastic package which weighs more than the entire product and manual contained inside, and requires careful cutting to avoid damaging the headset and cables inside, and the customer outside. I find it a little disappointing that the package is much more sturdy and solid than the product inside it.
$SUMMARY.: Goes well with: Antiseptic and sutures

$REVIEW.: I was excited to get this Dash Cam for such a great price, and I read good reviews about it online. Now, I don't know if it was the seller or the product which made it such a hassle.It came nicely wrapped, and I was excited to use it. I get it all set up in my car, and it turns on; but constantly says &#34;card error&#34;. I did the package off amazon where i can buy the &#34;Transcend 32 gb&#34; sd card, so I know it was new. But I tried other SD cards, and nothing worked! It just kept saying card error. I got the Transcend SD card to finally not show &#34;Card error&#34;, but when I tried to record, it refused, as if the memory card was full.I brought it in with me that night, because I didn't want the heat from my car to ruin it. I tried turning it on the next day (while having the car charger hooked up to it) and it wouldn't even turn on. I tried it inside my place, and still, would not turn on (even though it had been charging all night)!I am sending it back. Don't waste your money- maybe mine was defective, but it wasn't worth the money, or effort.

$REVIEW.: I've used Microsoft ergonomic keyboards since 1997
 My first (Natural Elite) lasted over 10 years, and I only replaced it because the keys were losing the spring in their step
 My second (Ergo 4000) lasted two
 First the letters started to rub off the keys, and then one day it just quite entirely


 No lights, no nothing


 But I love ergonomic keyboards so I went and bought another Ergo 4000


 A day later it went back to the store because the feeling in the keys was just awful.Whatever happened to quality?!  Apaprently it headed over to Logitech because the Illuminated Keyboard is a great pleasure to type on


 It is the nicest keyboard I have seen and used in a long, long time


No typing fatigue at all, even for this ergo junkie.Now if I can only get 10 years out of it.

$REVIEW.: This strap only has one job to do:  Don't let your device go.  It's cool looking, lightweight, compact, easy to use.  But come on.  We are not exactly attaching cheap stuff to it.  It's for a camera or in my case, a laser rangefinder of same size/weight, which I happened notice laying on the ground behind me, because the strap broke.On examining it, I see the cord that attaches to the device is just light nylon or some such.  No wire.  No reinforcement.  Of course it's going to wear.  It was frayed at one spot and quietly separated.  I was just lucky.

$review_text.: This camera is sharp looking, and takes decent pictures. However, to get those pictures, you have to be in perfect lighting, with nobody moving and have the settings adjusted each picture. It also takes way too long to take a shot, and between pictures takes awhile to reset. Once you get a good picture, however, it is of great quality.The battery life is what really made me return the thing. It seems that, even if the camera has been off for days after charging, something drains it - I'd charge it, let it sit between uses, then when I had to go use it again, it would be dead! I could get through about 35 photos before the battery died. Charging it wasn't quick, either.

$review_text.: I had a problem receiving an adequate wi-fi signal in an office at the far end, lower level, of my house
The problem is that there are many walls and much electronic equipment, such as large flat screen TVs between the location of my broad band internet connection and my office
My first step was to upgrade my older router to the Asus RT-N66U; the improvement was substantial but not perfect
Then I added the Asus WL-ANT-157 Antenna and that fixed the problem completely

Now my signal strength at 100 feet as it is at 10 feet

I would recommend the Asus two part solution without hesitation.

$review_text.: Just hooked the KCA-ip500 to my Kenwood Marine head unit.  It works as advertised, however its not without complications.First it does not charge iphone.Second it renders the iphone to accessory mode so you can not control the phone's ipod with the touch screen.You just have to select the playlist you want then plug the dock connector into the ip500.  Then you can go forward and back throughthe playlist with the controls on the head unit.  It's a little complicated, but the sound is great and the Kenwood I have does not have anaux input.  I did have to unplug the satellite because the ip-500 uses the same input on the back of the radio.  There is a splitter that willallow both to be used, but I don't use the satellite so it was not an issue.  Don't know yet if the phone will receive calls while plugged in.Will update as soon as I do.

$REVIEW.: Pros:Easy to ProgramNice FeelCons:Battery Life (1 week or so)Screen is too touchyBottom Line:Expensive remote with a few quirks makes me give it a neutral rating.  Its saving grace is its configurability.  I programmed it in just minutes and one of the buttons was incorrect, and reprogramming the functionality of that button was very easy.Review:One issue is no matter what button you press the display turns on, which wastes battery life.  It also turns on if you touch the display.  It seems to me the display should only activate if you press a button specifically for activating the screen or maybe touching the screen, but the downside here is a fully charged battery only last about a week of light use.  My other remotes, even touch screen models last for months.  This does come with a recharging cradle, but longer battery life would give this a 4 star rating.My other star comes off from the fact that the screen is really touchy.  It is a capacitive touch screen, which makes it work much better than the resistive types, being easier to press the buttons and you don't have to keep mashing the screen, but the problem is it is always sensitive and easy to touch when you don't want to.  I find myself frequently hitting the bottom line of buttons on the display.Overall, this remote is a great usability improvement vs the Harmony 650 I have, where the old remote always ends up in some help mode and locks the remote out until you step through a tutorial on how to use it.  I haven't seen the new remote do this at all.  I have also used a Philips Prestigo touch screen remote, it had much longer battery life, but was difficult to program and the resistive touch screen was inaccurate leading to accidentally ejecting disks, etc, but the remote had a nice simple design to it.  I think this Harmony Touch remote is nearly there, just adding increased battery life and maybe forcing you to press a specific button to activate the touch screen would make it 5 stars for me (this might help battery life too, as I think the waiting for touch screen input puts a constant drain on the battery).

$REVIEW.: Pros:1. Flexible programming model allows you to customize the remote to your requirements.Cons:1. A lot of programming is required to get the remote to a usable state.2. Programming model for the XPRESS key is unnecessarily complicated and inflexible.3. The "Add New Component" wizard is pretty much useless. You will end up having to program many keys through "Learning" from your old remotes.4. Some saved settings were not been restored upon reload.  I had to reenter them into the software.Conclusion:Getting this remote to work is a project. In fact the software makes you create a project folder on your computer ....If you enjoy programming, I suppose you will be okay with this product. If you want a remote that works right out of the box, you will be very disappointed.If Sony puts one more engineering year into this product, it will be very good. As it is, it is an unfinished engineering product. Let's hope Sony provide some kind of upgrade.Update:A few engineering days later, I am done with the programming of my remote. Try to think of this as a programmable toy, otherwise you will want to call Sony to scream at someone.

$REVIEW.: In order to hear anything out of these headphones your child will have to turn the volume way up.I bought headphones for my kids to use when they are playing their games together in the living room. I bought the Belkin Speaker and Headphone Splitter so each of them can plug their earphones into the receiver and so I can have some peace and quiet.The sound coming through these earphones whisper compared to my son's earphones (JVC HARX500 Over-the-Ear Headphones - A HIGHLY RECOMMENDED PRODUCT) and it is very disappointing because my kids cannot use their earphones as intended. The volume needs to be turned way up on the receiver which is entirely too loud for my son. Also take this into consideration, when she unplugs these earphones from the receiver the volume on the receiver is so loud I fear my speakers will blow.When used on an individual basis she still has a problem hearing through these earphones even with the volume turned up to the maximum on the devices she uses. My other complaint is that the wire is extremely short causing her to have to sit closer to the TV than I would like her to. The only good thing I can say about this product is that it is super cute, which is all they are selling. My daughter loves that they have the My Little Pony design on them but has often said she likes her brother's earphones better because they &#34;sound better.&#34; Which goes to show you, even kids care about quality and will prefer quality over what's &#34;cute.&#34;A better buy is the Kidz Gear Wired Headphones For Kids - Pink found here on Amazon HOWEVER they lasted about 4 months (Christmas present) because the wire connecting to the jack completely separated. The volume was comparable to my son's headphones and the wire length was a lot longer.I've had it with these &#34;kids&#34; head phones and will be paying for quality products in the future. These novelty products are just a waste of money.

$REVIEW.: Excellent purchase for the price I paid.  Works great sending signal from my computer to outdoor location (approximately 50 feet through a wall with window).  It is a little testy when I first turn it on, often requiring slight adjustments to the tuning to find the proper signal frequency.  Every once in a while I think uncontrollable outside static also causes issues, requiring me to readjust the frequency on the transmitter and receiver.  But once working, I've rarely had to make adjustments--and it plays just fine for hours.I have not used batteries yet, so I do not know the life when playing music without AC plug-in.  But overall, it has been an excellent purchase and far simpler than wiring outdoor speakers, at least for now.

$review_text.: I moved to T4i from T2i. I have used T2i for more than 2 years, pleased with its performance and recently sold it. Before moving to T4i, I tested D5100 and D3200. I did not like D5100 due to lack of external controls and poor battery life. Same for D3200 and high noise due to high mega pixels. So finally settled at T4i.After using this camera for a week, I returned it, that will be explained later in this review.Pros:+ It offers touch screen (very handy when setting focus on live view),+ It has HDR (does not produce the perfect blend of 3 shots, but good to have in built HDR rather than post processing).+ It has Hand Held Night Shot feature, which produces excellent output with very good details in low light, it takes 4 shots quickly in low light and then takes few seconds to produce the final image.+ STM Lens (18-135) works as mentioned by Canon, there is no noise while auto focusing in video mode. It seems STM lens has electronic focus ring as you can keep on rotating the focus ring and it does not have a stop, most probably it uses internal auto focus motor of T4i.Coins:- The camera frozen 2-3 times while using, I had to remove and re-insert the battery to get it working again.- Since focus ring does not have any stop while rotating, there is not acknowledgement that you reached the bottom or top of the focus limits, you just guess.Why I returned this camera:-- After a week of use the camera Frozen again in Auto Mode (While Using Internal Flash) and showed error 50 on screen, I removed the battery and re-inserted, it worked, but when I went to Auto Mode again using Internal Flash, it showed same error. It's loop of error which does not fix changing the settings.It may be an issue with this piece of camera only, looking at the good features, I am giving 4 stars to this Camera.Edit: 11/24/2012I ordered a replacement for same camera, if it works fine, I will change the rating to 5.Edit: 12/04Changing the rating to 5. The replacement unit does not have the problem that I faced on the previous one.

$review_text.: This is a review as well as a comparison with other similar products out there.I've done extensive research in digital media players and have tried the following models:a)  Roku XDS, b) WD V Live Plus, c) Sony network media player SMP N100, 4) Apple TV and Boxee software on the laptop.I really wanted to like Roku and was super excited to set is up and have it connected to the internet and was installing apps within minutes. After few days I realized that the hassle of entering a code for every app and then registering on the app providers is too much of a hassle. Even if I wanted to play the content thru USB, it was  a hassle with private channels. Another issue with this is that Roku is not DLNA certified so it doesn't work with your other machines on the network. You would need to jump thru the hoops of creating private channels or some elaborate setup to achieve that.  If you install too many apps, it runs out of memory and you'd need to uninstall some.Apple TV has the best interface and the most intuitive one. The only issue is that it only streams via iTunes so sharing thru anything else is a problem. Some people have installed Boxee on AppleTV sort of expands its capabilities in terms of the network support.WD TV Live Plus is the best so far in my research and trials. It pretty much plays any content you throw at it and it recognizes the formats. There are not a lot of widgets (compared to Roku and Boxee) so you might feel limited in terms of what can be achieved, but if you install a TVersity server on one of the machines on your network then you can pretty much stream any content to the box. Installing TVersity is a snap (and free). This is also a DLNA certified device so it sees all the other windows devices on your network and you can play them on the box wirelessly. I've streamed 1080p thru a wireless laptop on the device and it worked without any hitch. This also support "Play to" in the media player according to the book, but I've not had success with it.  I had my 1TB external USB drive connected to it and it was a sweet set up in terms of access to all my media. Since it's a DLNA device, I could also access my external 1TB disk on the network to copy/move data around and it didn't need a computer to do it.Boxee software on the laptop works great but I haven't tried the hardware box as it's around the double the price of its compititiors.  There are just too many apps on it so it becomes difficult to find what you want to play and then it has memory limitation as well. The interface is user configurable so you can get skins downloaded for your preferences.Sony network media player is also a DLNA certified device but I came across the following issues: a) when I connect a external usb drive which has two partitions, it only recognizes the first partition and doesn't show the second one. While WD TV Live Plus shows both as hard disks. b) It recognizes the Windows 7 machine quickly as a media repository but only sees the directories which are marked as 'Library' in the Windows Media Player on the machine. You would have to add more directories to the library if you want its content to show up on the Sony device. WD TV Live Plus also recognizes the device as a network share so you are free to browse all the folders. You just need to set the 'source' in the settings as the root level folder then everything is visible. c) 'Play To' from the windows machine of Windows Media Player tries to contact the Sony device but always gives an error of "unsupported format" even though the same file plays fine directly from the Sony device. Never been able to use "Play To" successfully.  d) For some widgets like Hulu/Netflix etc you would need to register at a sony url from the computer before you can use it. e) The on-screen keyboard is like a 'phone keypad' where the alphabets on keys 0-9 so you would either need to press the same button multiple times to enter a character or use the arraw buttons to go the right key, in which case it's easy to overshoot. Would have been nice to have a full screen keyboard like WD TV Live plus.. although Boxee device has a complete keyboard on the remote which would be even better to enter the words for search etc. f) It won't see many file formats since the support is not as wide as WD TV Live Plus. g) on the positive side, the dolby/dts sound from the device sounds much better than others, but if you are directing the HDMI thru a receiver then you don't care about it. h) also has composite and component out which makes it more flexible compared to hdmi only.Overall, if you are interested in just using the online services like Hulu Plus, Netflix, or Amazon VoD then you can get Apple TV for the easiest interface. Although Apple TV specifically does not support Hulu officially but there are hacks available. If your inner 'geek' wants to make it a central device where you can add your own hard disks with it or stream content from any device in your home or stream any content from the internet using TVersity etc or play any format of audio or video, then get the WD TV Live Plus.*** Update after more than a year - March 2012***Been pretty happy with WDTV Live Plus and it has worked as a network storage as well as a DLNA media player for all formats since most TVs (including my Panasonic Viera) don't support many formats.

$review_text.: I have always been wary of &#34;protection&#34; plans and whether they really will cover much or if they are really necessary. I got one with the purchase of my tablet and in less than a year was experiencing some issues with the screen. It was still under manufacturer's warranty so I paid for shipping and sent it in and nothing was done. Later as the issue got worse I sent it in when it was under the square trade warranty. I did not have to pay for shipping, they gave me a label and they fixed the problem in a short amount of time! It was very useful.
$SUMMARY.: Actually used this and it worked!

$REVIEW.: ***** WARNING:  THIS DRIVE IS GARBAGE - DO NOT BUY - DO NOT BUY - DO NOT BUY - DO NOT BUY *****I picked up one of these a couple of weeks ago.  The concept of a good ruggedized portable USB hard drive for the consumer market is LONG overdue.  The 500GB SimpleTough worked fine the first few times I used it, plugging the fold out USB ribbon cable into a laptop or desktop...everything seemed ok and it worked like a champ...and was faster than any other external USB drive of its size that I've ever used.  Now all of a sudden I start getting "Device Not Recognized", no matter what laptop or desktop, USB port, or even USB hub (powered) that I plugged it into, and regardless of OS (using XP or Vista).  After several iterations of patiently unplugging it, letting it spin down for a minute, then plugging it back in...still not recognized.  So during my last attempt I was going to give up, box it back up and return it...I started to reach to unplug the drive and lifted it up off of my desk a little bit...and suddenly...it WORKED and my system recognized it.  So I tried the theory, I unplugged it again, let it sit, plugged it back in while it was sitting flat...didn't work...then as soon as I elevated it to about a 45 degree angle off my desk it was recognized and worked again.  Diagnosis...bad USB ribbon cable, and bad workmanship.  I have treated this drive with kid gloves and it never got any kind of abuse, period. The drive may be ruggedized, but clearly the ribbon cable is a serious Achilles heel.  I can't say all of these drives are bad since it was just this one, but if you buy one of these KEEP YOUR RECEIPT AND ORIGINAL PACKAGING...it may end up like mine did.  I am probably going to get a replacement, if I do...I'll update this review good or bad based on what happens.  For now, it's definitely a 1 star (0 star) product in my opinion.UPDATE 8/31/09 - *3 stars now*...got a replacement SimpleTough 500GB, so far it is working great...time will tell, and I will update this review with any good or bad news soon.  I would have given this product at least 3 stars for the fact my replacement works fine, but Amazon...why do you allow people to edit reviews and not change the star rating if their opinion has changed?  The stars are the first (and sometimes only) thing people look at...11/4/09 - NO STARS, Amazon, how about giving us negative star review capability?***FAIL***  THIS IS GARBAGE.  After being used for very light duty (probably have copied about 100GB+ data to it that was read statically off and on afterwards, not much writing/deleting after that), and being treated like a fine piece of delicate glass artwork for a few months, the USB cable on my replacement is dead too.  But if I gently tilt the unit to a 45 degree angle, magically the USB cable works...just don't bump it or it disconnects.  This is ridiculous especially in this day and age where portable hard drive technology is MATURE AND WELL ESTABLISHED.- Tried emailing Hitachi about this issue, no response.UPDATE:12/7/09 - Opened support case with Hitachi's Storage support (aka their SimpleTech division)[...]12/9/09 - no reply from Hitachi support, not even an acknowledgement of my support issue that I filed through their portal.HITACHI - *RECALL* THESE DRIVES before someone forces you to do so legally.  You rip off consumers and expect to be rewarded with continuing business?  I am never recommending anything made by Hitachi to anyone.  A little business common sense 101, you fix product quality problems instead of ignoring them, letting them worsen, and eat at your bottom line.  I predict Hitachi will not have an external storage business at this rate, and will spin SimpleTech back off as an "unprofitable" venture.  Quality is an investment that pays back one hundred fold.2/8/10 - UPDATE - HITACHI, YOU NEED TO REPLACE THESE DRIVES.  After this unit failed, like 99.9% of them do, I decided to see if I could fix the problem.  I opened up the case by cracking off the side panels and prying the top from the bottom after removing the case screws and then the screws securing the drive to the plastic enclosure.  What you have inside is a HACK JOB of USB cable splicing onto a HD-2523 v1.2 USB header (wafer) board...and the cable is hanging on literally by a THREAD.  You have 2 black cables, one of which is twisted into the sheathing filament wire and is literally hanging by a thread...then the other green, white, and red wires are very badly crimped near the connection to the USB board...almost to the point where they are severed).  THAT is why when this unit fails, you have to angle it at 45 degrees up or down, or flip it over and plug it upside down into say a USB 2.0 hub - but eventually the delicate wiring will snap in half internally. You basically have 5$ worth of cheap plastic, rubber, and electronic parts, attached to a Hitachi 500GB 5400RPM drive (model# HTS545050B9A300 / part# A57915) which is worth about $45.00 at mfr cost.  This unit is worth about $50-60 TOPS leaving the factory...and the 500GB models were originally sold for nearly $200.00!!!!  The markup isn't as much of a shocker as is the dirt poor quality of this unit.  I am trying to see if I can find or cobble together another USB enclosure or wafer board/USB cable combo compatible with this drive, or...try to find someone with a laptop that could take this drive and at least get the data off of it.This is the hard drive itself, same model/revision, etc on Amazon:http://www.amazon.com/Hitachi-Travelstar-5K500-B-Internal-0A57915/dp/B0029LHVLO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=electronics&qid;=1265685083&sr;=8-1UPDATE 2/11 - SAVE YOUR DRIVE!  If you have fallen victim to the poor quality of this unit, don't throw it away or give up hope yet.  I'm going to explain how to quickly extract that hard drive from the Hitachi enclosure, and put the drive into another 2.5" enclosure that works flawlessly.  To remove the small 2.5" hard drive from the case, snap off the black side panels (yes there will be tiny little pieces of plastic broken off - who cares at this point).  You will have to use some force, don't be shy about it.  Now remove the case screws, open the case, then remove the screws inside the case that secure the drive.  If you have to or want to cut the stupid black ribbed USB ribbon cable protruding outside the drive enclosure, go ahead...it won't matter later because you are going to be using a different drive enclosure later.  Save the screws if you work on computers, they can be handy for something else.  You will see a green USB wafer board attached to the little 2.5" Hitachi hard drive inside.  If it looks scary to you, don't be scared.  It's just a standard 500GB 2.5" laptop hard drive plugged into a wafer board, nothing fancy or permanent about it.  You will see where the hard drive is attached to this board...it is NOT glued or soldered on don't worry, the hard drive is just plugged in to that USB wafer board...that's all.  Gently pull back on the hard drive and it will come free from the green USB wafer board.  Now put the 2.5" Hitachi hard drive in a safe place.  Now go buy or order a 2.5" drive enclosure that is compatible with this drive (far as drive size 2.5", and it is for SATA spec...preferably one that supports at least USB 2.0, or optionally eSATA).  You can use any you want, but I HIGHLY recommend the Acomdata 2.5" USB/eSATA hard drive enclosure sold at Amazon here:  Acomdata Tango USB 2.0/eSATA 2.5-inch SATA Hard Drive Enclosure (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001XHBNN2/ref=oss_product) - FOR $19.99!  Using that enclosure it took me 5 minutes to install my hard drive into that case and get it running with the included USB 2.0 cable. You probably spent more than $100.00 on this Simpletough drive, $19.99 and 5-10 minutes of effort to get the use of your hard drive back isn't much to ask.  When you get the new enclosure, you do nothing but follow the directions that come with that enclosure to install and power on your Hitachi hard drive, in its new home.  This is the last entry I am typing on this item, and I REALLY REALLY hope Hitachi gets their act together.  Reminds me of Toyota...Hitachi sees poor quality and the consequences of it (all this Amazon and other site's feedback is publicly viewable!  I am also sure sales have fallen off for external Hitachi storage products in the past couple years, but yet the company sticks its head in the sand hoping it will all go away.  You can NEVER put a value on quality, it is priceless!***** WARNING:  THIS DRIVE IS GARBAGE - DO NOT BUY - DO NOT BUY - DO NOT BUY - DO NOT BUY *****

$REVIEW.: These replaced AR outdoor speakers on our pool house.  These Klipsch were on sale and do have pretty good bass for such small units as I have them mounted beneath the pool house gutters, not near the ground.  I am very happy with the Klipsch, could crank them up if my receiver could muster the power but the receiver is not rated well for distortion.  I have in my house Klipsch towers for modular stereo bought 20 years ago, still going strong.  Love Klipsch.  Our company installed a financial software package for them when they were in Arkansas (now Indiana), and the engineers said they could produce the best quality speakers in the industry but they would have received a lot of backlash from competitors for doing so.  I believe them.

$review_text.: I must say I was a bit skeptical when ordering.  Its all true.. super easy to install..perfect clear install.  Super responsive can really tell its there.  I was worried about the slight air gap but you cant tell its there.  The matte is 100% better than the zagg I just replaced it with.  The zagg distorted the screen so bad it made for a bad experience.  This has a less effect on image quality.  I would love a crystal clear one however.  Hopefully they will come up with a clear one soon!Get it you will love it!  It really is an ingenious way to solve all the issues with other types of films.  It just adheres around the edges only not the actual screen itself.Nice job to the developers!

 As with other reviewers, I do not like the asymmetrical cable lengths


 I have found that cord noise is noticeable, quite so at times


 The sound quality is good to very good, but to me, not great


 The fit and finish is very good and it seems with proper care they should last a long time

 However, when it is time to look for another set I will definitely try another product before buying these again.

$review_text.: So I've had my laptop for over 2 years and it's my primary tool for work - I use it all day, EVERYDAY! SO suffice to say, my original battery gave way some time ago and I was restricted to regular a/c power
I even got a notification on my laptop recommending I change my battery
Thinking way ahead though, I ordered this battery a week before the alerts.When my new battery arrived it had that "fresh from the store" look and smell - like when you purchase new shoes (I don't need to give details about how happy I was, right?) Immediately I swapped batteries, booted up my laptop and waited..


fresh out of the box it had just about 50% remaining and lasted almost 2 hrs!! I didn't charge it then, I just used it and allowed it to die so I could start a fresh recharge cycle and that's where it got even better!When charging was complete, I felt like I had a brand new laptop all over again! On 100% charge, "Balanced" power setting with the lowest screen brightness selected, along with my wi-fi on, my new battery gave me over 3 1/2 hrs worth of usage! (Once I ran Photoshop for about an hour though it had just about 1 hr + change left.)I'd recommend this battery to anyone in need of that "back to life and as good as new" feeling for their laptop!

$REVIEW.: Man, i bought this camera about 3 weeks ago, and I am so happy with it.  This camera is Great.  I love it.  I think I am going to marry it.  I have bought a lot of cheap digital camera's from 1 to 3 mp but this is one is by far the best.  With 10x optical zoom you can hardly beat this for the price.  My only problems with the whole package was the software it came with.  I had a few conflicts with it.  I am using an Hp a520n running xp and the problems came when transferring the pictures to the computer via the included software.  The funny thing is, the computer was brand new too and I was about to go out and buy a card reader for when I noticed that the computer had a 9 in 1 card reader right on the front panel!  duh! So I just removed everything but the drivers for the camera and i transferred the pictures via the xd card.  I also recommend getting re-chargeale batteries for this and keeping a charged set with you if you're going on trips.  It comes with batteries but it used them up in two days. This camera takes some awesome photos, it even makes me look like an experienced ametuer.  GET IT NOW.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this battery for a Sony Mavica digital camera. Unfortunately, when I installed the battery, I got an error message. As it turns out, the camera requires an Info-Lithium battery and this battery is only a lithium battery. I either failed to notice the requirement in the manual, or there is no definitive explanation, I could find, for the specific battery required. Either way, the shipper, when notified did not hesitate to send me the required Info-lithium batter at no charge. I am extremely pleased with the shipper but not so much with the specific battery requirement.

$REVIEW.: I really enjoy this fan.It's portable and small enough to carry around.Out of the box, the legs easily snap on.Then you decide how you want to power it.-Battery (Not included)-AC Power-Charging the unit itself**One thing that's very important is to have the unit in the STOP position when you charge it. The green light should be flashing when it's properly charging.  My unit had a piece of clear tape over the power switch.  For the fan to properly charge, it's very important to move the switch to the STOP position.  You can read this in the unit directions.  **There's also USB charging.The fan is small enough to put just about anywhere.  Keep in mind it's not a large fan.  If it were large it would not be as portable as it is now.For it's size it gives  a nice breeze.  Add in the portability it provides, and you have a good fan.This is also a fan you can use if you have no AC power.  A sure plus for those who have had no fan during power outages.

It worked quite well showing no latency issues with HD video. Thought the class-10 cards were good investments.1 week later, when I actually wanted to use it for video recording, my camera stopped working at the end of the taping complaining about the card. Then I tried the card on my PC, iPad, etc. No device can read it.I am not sure if this is a defective SanDisk card or a counterfeit yet. Will sort it out in the next couple of days.Update: Called SanDisk hotline. The cards are genuine. Just bad cards.

I could have saved $20 getting them here and there is no way I'm returning them.Just got a Nano and needed an earbud solution other than what comes with it. For whatever reason my ears don't hold the stock apple buds. Any head movement and they pop right out. I was afraid these wold do the same but happily, they don't.Rock solid in the ears. I could do cartwheels down the block and they wouldn't fall out. With the included 3 size inserts, they will do the same for just about any ear size.Sound is very good. When they say 6 to 23k hz they ain't kidding. The bass that comes out of something this small is hard to believe. The in the ear canal design provides sweet isolation from outside noise. I vacuumed the whole house listening to the Nano and hardly could tell the vacuum was running.I haven't been too impressed with Sony lately but I just may become a fan again after these.

$REVIEW.: There must be some trick to getting the cord wrapped on this thing that I don't know.  I simply could not figure out how to be able to extend the cord to the wall socket and to the attached device.  If I left a long bit so I could reach the socket, I couldn't turn the wheel to roll up the rest of the cord(and while trying, cut myself on the cheap plastic).  Instead, I had to secure the female end, which means I'll have to move the unit to my appliance and whenever I want to move the shop vac, or whatever, I'll have to move the cord reel too.  I thought all these things were supposed to make the job easier, but I was wrong.  The stand on my other cord wheel is open on one side, which allows one end of the cord to stick out through a hole in the reel and allows easy wrapping, plus it's far better quality and has no sharp edges.  I'll probably end up throwing this thing away.  I could only get 50' of yellow cord around it anyway.  Wrestling with the cord would be easier for me than trying to use this thing.  I recommend spending a bit more and getting a unit that isn't so flimsy and limited in design.

$REVIEW.: After years of being frustrated with the extremely wide field of view on my 50mm f/1.4, I am finally able to breathe. Thanks to the new 58mm, my photos are fantastic. Such a huge difference! I mean, who has the time to take 2 - 3 steps forward in order to reframe their shot or spend countless hours in Photoshop cropping out unwanted distractions?? This new 58mm makes those annoying extra steps a thing of the past. By offering a slightly longer focal length, I am easily able to cut out annoying family members trying to photobomb what would otherwise be an perfect moment. Portraits show slightly more detail and the bokeh is worlds above your average f/1.4.Now, don't let the price scare you away. This lens is worth every penny. If you've already wasted $400 on the 50mm 1.4 like I did, shatter that thing on the ground and melt down the glass to make your own brand of mason jars. That's about all it's good for. Think about it. for only $1,200 more you can add an entire 8mm to your focal length.But wait, for that kind of extra money, why am I not getting a bigger aperture? Don't be silly! The people at Nikon are incredibly smart but they certainly aren't wizards! A wider aperture for under $10,000? Impossible! Pay no attention to the $600 50mm f/1.2 lens. That thing is manual focus. Are you kidding me? MANUAL? You might as well draw the picture by hand rather than waste time trying to focus on your own.All in all, this lens is a Gem. If you were even considering buying a different; faster; less expensive lens, you should probably smash yourself in the head with whatever lenses you do have.Buy this lens, your family will love you more.

$review_text.: I've had my 32" mounted on this on the wall for a couple weeks now and I'm very happy with the results
It didn't take a lot of time to get it mounted, but I did it by myself so it was a bit of a challenge bolting the TV to the mount alone


The stand does not wobble

As long as you know how to tighten all the different connections, then it will work just fine


I think some people probably need to have a professional install it for them so that they do not give the product a bad review

This stand is definitely recommended for those with common sense.

$REVIEW.: Maybe not the best title considering all the gun rage lately but this armband will not fit if you are a man or a woman with muscular arms. It did fit my arms (mine run slender) however, did not fit my nephews or boyfriends. They lift weights regularly as well and are not built like body builders whatsover. Overall, does not have enough elasticity to fit over a trained  bicep.

$review_text.: I've been using a trusty Airport Extreme router for about 7 years now

 While it still works great, its starting to get outdated, so I was really excited to try out the Linksys WRT 1900AC.Years ago Linksys was a solid brand, but they had a few years of mediocre routers

 Thankfully the 1900AC takes them back to the solid brand I remember them being.Packaging:The Linksys comes packaged in a very well-cushioned box, which is constructed well enough to easily be re-usabe if you plan on moving in the future
 Included is the router, the four antennae, a disk with instructions + short printed quick-start guide, the power cable, and an ethernet cable.Setup:Setup was a breeze
 I've messed around with all sorts of routers and this was probably the easiest set up (for a basic home network) that I've ever done - it was quicker and simpler than even apple's Airpot Extreme, which is saying a lot.Menus:The menus of a router can run the gamut from information heavy and confusing to simplistic and bare

 The Linksys strikes a great balance between information, usability, and features


 For the average home user it will provide everything you need and more in a simple and intuitive user interface


 For me this is a big deal, because I don't think I've ever used the word 'intuitive' in conjunction with a router's menu


 That said, power users may be disappointed if used to something like DD-WRT.Performance:Performance is excellent

 I noticed an immediate improvement over my old Airport Extreme
 Dual-band is great as I can have an older device (such as my PS3) using the 2.4GHz band, while migrating most of my newer devices to the 5GHz


 The range is also great in my house, though my house is on the smaller side and the walls don't block signals too badly

 That said, I would expect more than adequate coverage in most homes.Advanced Features:I haven't tried hooking any backup solutions/drives up to this yet, though the menu makes it extremely simple to do so

 Once I do I'll update my review accordingly


 I have read elsewhere that the router does a great job with this, though.Overall:The Linksys WRT 1900AC gives you a great performing, advanced, high-end router with an intuitive and easy to understand interface

 Setup is a breeze and it should offer easy options for hooking up external backup drives

 Even the packaging is high-end

 However this all comes at a cost as this is one of the most expensive home routers on the market
 That said, when I bought my airport 7 years ago it was also very expensive and ended up being well-worth the money
 If this Linksys also manages to last for years  (and I see no reason why it wouldn't) then it would be, in my mind, a definite no-brainer purchase.

$REVIEW.: This is a cute and really portable speaker with decent sound
The max volume could be louder - that would be a plus, but otherwise the direct use (non-bluetooth) works well and serves the purpose

We cannot speak to the BT functionality.We were somehow shipped (and charged for) TWO with our order for ONE, and could not return for a refund, so that made it overly expensive (we only need one for our Children's Ministry classroom!), but we hope that is not something everyone would encounter.BLESSINGS!

$REVIEW.: I bought one of these for my Canon SD-800 and can recommend it.  For many years now, I've carried Canon pocket cameras on my belt while traveling and the Canon-branded cases are simply the best for this purpose.  My only criticism of the Canon cases has been their lack of a small pocket for media.  I was hoping that with the tiny size of SD cards Canon would have added such a pocket to their newer cases, but they haven't.  On the plus side, the case retains the superior leather construction, uses a neat magnetic tie down for the flap instead of Velcro or a snap, and has a belt loop that is tight enough to hold the camera comfortably against your body.  The package also includes a nice looking leather replacement strap for your camera.  Incidentally, the SD-800 is well matched to the case, fitting quite securely.

The Filter pen is larger than the Lens pen and is flat rather than concave, hence it will clean a filter much faster and more effectively on a flat filter. Since I keep filters on all of my lenses as a protective measure, the filter pen wll surely be my primary cleaning tool.

$REVIEW.: I was very happy to try out this product
Upon opening the box I was able to get it connected to my wireless network with less than five minutes
It also automatically found and upgraded the firmware

It took more time to set the clock on the unit than to connect to my network.The touch screen is OK

The first thing you do is calibrate it

I found it to be off a few times after calibration but think you just need to hit the buttons with more pressure


The thing I did like about the `frame' was being able to watch web TV and radio
What is great about it is you can pick any country to watch TV and radio! Growing up in Germany I opted to watch German channels and the picture was not bad


However, I kept losing my connection and it would reboot the frame
I lost my wireless connection a lot but never lost my connection on my laptop.The sound is OK but not great


It does not go that high but it has a decent clear sound
Now the biggest issue for me was seeing how pictures looked on this `frame'


I loaded up the same photos I have on my iPod touch, the pictures are very clear on my iPod touch
When viewing the same photos on the frame I was not as impressed


It seemed grainy and just not as clear as I expected it to be

Over all it is a nice internet frame but think it could have better and more useful features to it
It is nice but not super.Last I was surprised at the plastic that holds the frame up

It is flimsy and I think with the frame being a bit heavier that a sturdier frame holder would be helpful
Over all a nice internet frame but did not 'wow' me
It has potential and hope they are able to make a few upgrades to the unit.

$REVIEW.: I recently purchased the 4GB Cruzer Fit  I purchased the 16GB model for my truck about 1 year ago and have had great success

I have a place for the 4GB as that is the max capacity for what it will be installed into


It works great, files tranferred flawlessly and fast


I love the low profile in both the applications I use them for
No worrying about bumping them or breaking them off
I dont remove these very often from the scource I have them plugged into so I dont really fear loosing them


When I do remove them Im pretty particular about bringing them directly inside, hooking up to my laptop, loading the files needed and returning them back to thier intended place


If I find a need for yet another USB flash drive in the future, I'll likely purchase another Cruzer Fit


I highly recommend this item.

$REVIEW.: I didn't like the fit of the headset because of the amount of pressure it put on the area near my ears. I do have a large head, so this is probably why. The battery life of the headset is too short to not mention. I felt that I had to keep it charged at all times and if I forgot to plug it in or turn it off over night, it would be dead. Get back from work, and it's dead. Wireless, but always plugged in, that sucked! Those two things were deal breakers for me.I liked that I could mute the mic by rotating the mic towards the back. I liked that I could go downstairs and still communicate with people even though it was a good..30 feet away.Pros:rotating mic towards the back mutes the micwireless has a good rangegood receptioncons:plastic band crackedheadset is uncomfortableshort battery lifeoverall: if they fix the battery issues and make it more comfortable, I'll be back.

I listened to these for about an hour, playing a variety of music CD's and just couldn't take it anymore. I should have known better to expect quality sound from speakers at this price. Sorry Logitech, if this is the best you can do, it's not good enough. Kudos to Amazon! They took them back and refunded my money quickly. I'll gladly buy more stuff in the future, just not these speakers.

$REVIEW.: I bought a pair of these for my Sony Wega KDS-R50XBR1 50" and installed the first one this evening.  Zero problems with the installation, fits perfectly, the set recognized it, and it was back up and running like new within minutes.  The picture quality is bright and vibrant, so all seems well.The only thing I should mention here is that I'm told some of these generic replacement lamps burn out after only a few weeks or months of use, a much shorter time frame than they normally should last.  If this one happens to die a premature death, rest assured, I WILL RETURN TO UPDATE THIS REVIEW!As for right now, I can state that this is a quality replacement lamp and shipping was quick and easy through Lamps Direct.UPDATE on 02-23-2013:As promised, I'm back to report on these lamps if something were to go wrong.  Today, approximately 7 months after installing the first of two replacement lamps, I'm noticing that the picture is starting to go noticeably dark which marks the beginning of the end.To be absolutely fair, this TV is on approximately 12 hours a day, so over the course of 7 months, that's nearly 2,500 hours of use.  Not terrible, but I have seen others that are rated for 6,000 hours of use.  Since this one started to darken at less than half of that, I felt it necessary to report and let you decide if that's good enough.UPDATE on 05-01-2013:Well, the good news is that I'm still on the same lamp!  Yes, it started to darken approximately 2 months ago, but it's still working well enough to leave in.  At this point, I'm up to around 3,200 hours of use and only time will tell if it makes it the full 6,000 hours.

Went up very easily on my 2013 F150 and holds my Passport 8500 X50 solid
Went out for a test drive and tried to hit every bump and pothole I could find, the thing didn't budge

It came with the escort clip that goes into the detector so I didn't have to try to find the original suction cup mount that came with mine


I was tired of having the Escort Supercup mount falling off of my windshield at least once a week because the truck is parked out in the sun all day, now I won't have those worries
It's less than half the price of those higher blended type mounts and while it might not be as streamlined, I don't really care as the mount is behind my rearview mirror and I can't see it anyway

I'll be buying a second mount for my Escort 9500ix that's currently installed in my car.

$review_text.: Jabra is famous for its headsets for one reason, they're one of the best on the market. And like Jawbone, Jabra has recently made a push towards portable wireless speakers and even headphones with its Solemate and Revo series, which combine decades of experience in voice communication technologies.So are these any good?  We are about to find out.  I currently own the JayBirds so I will put them up against those.When I got these headphones The packaging is well made with a yellow rubber stripe across the middle to evoke a sense of sportiness, and overall adds value to the unboxing experience which I think is as important as the product itself.  Inside you'll find an accessory box filled with an assortment of ColorCore EarGel silicone tips, four sets to be specific &#8211; as well as three sets of EarWings ear stabilizers to help you find the perfect and most secure fit that best suits your preference and active lifestyle. In addition, you'll also get a very short micro-USB to USB charging cable, a tiny FitClip cable tidy as well as a unique code to download Jabra's Sound app for free on iOS devices which will let you unlock the Rox Wireless' Dolby-enhanced audio feature.  Last but not least, also included in the box is this cool looking fabric pouch which you can use to store your tips and EarWings along with the Rox Wireless.Although the Jabra Rox are bulkier than a typical pair of in-ear headphones, they do a superb job at looking great when you wear them. Surprisingly enough, they don't stick out as much and they definitely don't look ridiculous fitted inside your ears. I'm impressed by how comfortable they are to wear even though it did take me a while to adjust and find the right combination of tips to get the right fit, tight isolation and security; considering the oversized form factor in relation to normal wired in-ear headphones that is.Jabra has done a remarkable job putting together something that not only will look good, but will also endure heavy usage at virtually any weather condition. The Rox Wireless are designed to be extremely durable and are shock, water and dust resistant, and feature a kevlar-reinforced tangle-free cable. You can wear them out in the rain and sweat your ass off at the gym without needing to worry about ruining your investment.  In my opinion, they look WAY better than the JayBirds. The Rox Wireless make both of the BlueBuds X and BackBeat Go 2 seem so plasticky by comparison.What is better than plain in-ear headphones? The answer is right in front of you. Wireless in-ear headphones are as convenient to use as wireless speakers. And the Rox Wireless are a perfect example. But wireless freedom comes at a cost, and in the Rox Wireless' case it's that they lack stellar battery life. 6 hours is not plenty, though it isn't bad either. Expect to have to recharge your wireless in-ears frequently, or else be left with non-functioning duds and no music intimacy on demand. But think about your wireless freedom, the convenience of two independent devices connected wirelessly. You won't need to pull your smartphone out of your pocket of bag just to answer a call, switch a music track or adjust the volume whilst a cable tugs and flaps around when you walk or run.Comfort is where we think many people will run into trouble. It's crucial that you try out different sizes and combinations to find out what works best for you using the Rox Wireless' ColorCore EarGel tips and EarWings. At first I tried using the Rox Wireless without attaching on the EarWing silicone stabilizers which are the pointy rings that can optionally be slipped onto the Rox Wireless and are designed to lock them into your ear during intensive activities. I quickly found out that I wasn't able to achieve a very good fit that would stay inside my ears for more than a minute. I've tried all four silicone tips, and while I found the double flanged tips to provide the best fit, I wasn't happy with the fact that the sheer bulky of the Rox Wireless buds would simply fall out after a short period. It's extremely rare for me not to find the perfect fit using stock silicon tips included with in-ear headphones, but because the Rox Wireless aren't your typical wired in-ears, they require more support in order for them to stay secured inside your ear canals.The Rox Wireless offer up a multiple set of compelling features that you'd expect from a modern-day, state-of-the-art stereo Bluetooth headset, Don't waste your time its a marketing gimmick. &#8211; the only highlight being a magnetic power-saving feature. Jabra's unique magnetic power saving feature is amazingly useful, clever and simply impressive. The idea is to have the Rox Wireless be out to sleep when you're done using them by magnetically attaching the two earbuds together. As soon as you allow the Rox Wireless to cling together, they will automatically power off without you ever having to press a single button. And when you feel the urge to pick them up again, they will turn on all by themselves when you pull them apart. And because they're set to automatically pair to the last device you've paired them up with, the process is so seamless it may be called magical. So yes, Jabra was inspired by Apple's iPad and how accessories can wake and put it to sleep using a magnetic connection. The Rox Wireless work in the same exact way, and they do so faultlessly.I found this feature to be extremely pleasing and convenient to use. But there's a small problem. Because the two ends of the Rox Wireless which meet together in magnetic matrimony are both made from a painted brushed metal, the black finish will scratch from friction after a while and will not look very pretty as time goes by. You may have better luck with the white colored Rox Wireless instead due to the raw, uncolored brushed metal finish. Jabra could have avoided this cosmetic flaw by adding some rubber I between the two parts that magnetically connect to each-other, but instead it thought it would be a good idea to have to metal parts rubbing against one another. Speaking of rubbing, when you stow away the Rox Wireless after magnetically connecting them to go to sleep, there's a small chance that they can separate and turn back on unintentionally if something were to hit them or lean against them inside your gear bag or even inside your pocket. There's one way of making sure this won't happen though and that is to turn them off using the multi-function button on the remote module without magnetically connecting them together. Magnets don't solve everything, sadly.Call quality was good.  Audio during a call comes across very clearly and without distortion, while on the other end of the call, people will clearly hear your voice with a hint of echo in the treble-filled audio that is being picked up by the Rox&#8217; built-in microphone. All in all the experience of using the Rox as a headset is quite impressive and something that you&#8217;ll find to want to be doing on a regular basis because of how useful and convenient it is. So while the microphone's audio quality isn't the cleanest we've ever experienced, it is very much acceptable.Audio quality; They sound really, really good. These aren&#8217;t some Bluetooth headsets that just so happen to deliver stereo audio, but instead actual in-ear headphones that serve high quality audio. The same quality audio you&#8217;d find when using other in-ears at the $100-150 price range. Jabra may be stereotyped as a company that isn&#8217;t associated with music reproduction, but as far as we can tell Jabra shouldn't be overlooked when it comes to wireless audio gear. And to be quite honest, I was not expecting the Rox Wireless to sound as good as they do simply because Jabra isn&#8217;t the first thing I think about when I look for in-ear headphones. They are now though, especially when Bluetooth is part of the equation.  The Rox Wireless are on par with clear, warm dynamic sound that&#8217;s rich and full thanks to a deep low-end bass response. Speaking of bass, the Rox Wireless have plenty of it on offer. Without distorting or overpowering, the bass is thick and punchy tying together the midrange to deliver an exciting sound signature that isn&#8217;t without clarity. The highs have an above average polish where vocals come out sounding bright and confident up front.Marketing gimmicks aside, there's no denying that Jabra has created one of the best wireless in-ear headphones on the market. But they're still far from being perfect when considering other wired alternates. The mic quality could be much improved to eliminate that hint of echo added to the wearer's voice during phone conversations in order for us to highly recommend the Rox Wireless as an extraordinary stereo Bluetooth headset. Fortunately, they do not disappoint when it comes to music reproduction. And if you&#8217;re more of an audiophile, chances are you&#8217;re going to like the JayBird BlueBuds X more. But if you really like the idea of using wireless in-ear headphones and you&#8217;re a casual user or someone who appreciates good quality sound tightly packed into a well designed piece of kit, you&#8217;ll be hard pressed to find better sonically performing alternatives than the Rox Wireless.

$review_text.: This is my first iPod and I mostly love it


 Great form factor, beautiful screen, amazing click wheel that does exactly what you want it to, huge disc space, etc, etc, etc - all the good things you've read about.The I-Tunes software on my PC flawlessly imported my picture and music collection, no prompts required
 Thousand of pictures were shrunken and converted all automatically, one big batch, no problems

 Same with music


 Exporting them to the iPod: also a breeze, no prompts required to automatically get all that content into the iPod.But my videos were another matter entirely
 I was able to download videos from the Apple store, and play them on my PC and Ipod, with no trouble

 But the process of converting my home video clips (taken with digital camera) from QuickTime format (isn't that Apple already?) into the exact flavor of Mpeg-4 that the iPod requires is truly painstaking


 Literally hours of excruciatingly slow processing are required to convert each short home video clip from Apple's own QuickTime format into iPod friendly format, one at a time
 My Palm pilot with a 3rd party add-on plays those Apple Quicktime files just fine, no conversion required - why can't my Apple iPod?  It seems bizarre that Apple's hardware is so incompatible with its software

 Ideally all my Quicktime movies would be sucked up automatically in one big batch by I-Tunes and exported just as easily, as-is, to the iPod

 At the very least you'd expect a "Batch Processing" option, so that the user does not have to manually oversee the conversion of every single movie.

$REVIEW.: I had an external USB 2.0 hard drive that I used for backup, the power supply died but the disk itself was OK.  Instead of replacing the enclosure, I got a Plugable Technologies SATA docking station and alternate using the old WD Caviar GP 1TB disk and this WD Caviar Black 1TB disk for a week at a time apiece.I chose this disk primarily for the 5-year warranty.  Hard drives do fail and for the slight cost difference over the Blue or Green models (2 year warranty) was worth the additional warranty for me.

$REVIEW.: It is a nice convenience to have an extra cable and keep it in the 2nd car if you have one

If not then it is also very handy to have it inside the house and use it with the optional AC adapter and charge the GPS unit inside the house or motel when you need it


When it comes to any electrical device/accessory I do not trust any 3rd party stuff and do not take any chances, get the one from the manufacturer and this one is the OEM stuff for a good price.

$review_text.: I actually don't own this board.  I own another ASUS board.  But this is relevant.ASUS tech support is ASTOUNDING.  The best I have ever used by far.  They answer quickly-- I've never held for more then 3-5 minutes-- and when they do, oh boy.  They hire people with real, serious tech training.  They listen carefully and know problem causes by heart-- they're not using an automated troubleshooting system.  They suggest a solution and then wait on the line while you try it, so you don't have to go to the trouble of calling back.  They don't retreat after 2 minutes to telling you that come component X is no good and you need a new one, like so many tech lines.  I've been using the same MOBO for three years, and their support is to thank for that.  Additionally, they can help the tech-unsavvy and the tech-savvy in different ways.  I'm pretty in-tuned, and when the tech I spoke to realized this he told me to grab a multi-meter and start poking around, which prevented us from having to test hunches in indirect ways, saving a lot of time.I'm posting here because I want people to know how awesome their support is and buy their stuff for that reason.  I want the top guys at ASUS to see that this business model (spend more on keeping customers happy, make more on repeat sales) can succeed in a market where it is so rare.  We need to show corporations that we respond well to being treated well, and maybe one day amazing tech support will be the standard.I'm serious: I will never own a main-board other than an ASUS as long as they keep this level of customer respect.
$SUMMARY.: Asus customer support is outstanding.

The various ways it can be used makes for comfortable reading in a host of positions; being able to prop, rest, or hold it without fatigue in almost any reading environment.  I did have to trim off one tiny hard sharp edge, but that was no problem.So, why not five stars?  Well, the narrow strip of leather on the right side of the screen is slightly contorted, forming a little curve where it should be straight.  This does nothing to the functionality of the case, nor to its outward appearance.  But it is a flaw that, due to its location next to the screen, one is forced to stare at when reading.  Not a deal-breaker, just an trifling annoyance.

$REVIEW.: Like other reviewers, I purchased this product to connect my MacBookPro (which only has a Firewire 800 port) to an existing Firewire 400 drive that is used for Time Machine backups.  Despite occasional lost connections (which I attributed to my failure to get the plug seated properly), it provided generally reliable service for about 16 months.  But recently it has developed a crack at the point where the flat cable connects to the plug.I suspect that the problem is inherent in the design: a flat cable doesn't have as full a range of motion as a round one (compare the range of motion of a piece of string to that of a flexible tape measure and you'll get the general idea) and unless the computer and hard drive are placed so that the cable doesn't twist there will inevitably be some strain on it, leading to lost connections (since it won't be seated properly) and, eventually, to the sort of cracking and tearing that I eventually experienced.  Since it will probably be difficult for most users to arrange computers and hard drives so that everything lies along a straight line, with no flexing, twisting, or turning, this product is probably not going to be a good choice: while it's attractive (assuming you like Nuke suit orange) but ultimately unreliable.  So, from now on, I'll be sticking to conventional FireWire cables:  they're boring, but reliable -- and boring reliability is the name of the game when using external backup drives.LaCie offers a one-year warranty on their cables.  Since this is a good deal shorter than the one offered on their generally excellent hard drives, I suspect that tells you something.

If we hear anything, we just push a button on the monitor and get a view pretty much like they show in the product description.The device was incredibly easy to activate - just plug it in and it's working.  Mounting is also straightforward.  We had enough wire to mount the camera at the front of the shop and run the monitor into the adjacent home.Night vision rocks.  Wish my SLR could do that.I wouldn't really say the video is color - more like sepia tones.  But that is of no consequence.  I tried messing with the dials but the image was clearest at default settings and nothing enhanced the color.Rather than absolutely meeting my needs (at the least, I need a camera that I can rotate), it serves as a starting point for a more elaborate system.If you just need a simple to use and install system for your front door, this may be the way to go.

$review_text.: I love apple keyboards because the keys are shorter in height and allow for faster typing, with less finger strain
 None of the cheap imitations compare

 I tried the more inexpensive alternatives for my windows computer and was dissatisfied with all of them for various reasons (keys had way too much resistance, driver wasn't connecting for bluetooth, etc


 This keyboard is worth every penny if you are a fast typist like me, and want to avoid putting excessive strain on your fingers (like carpal tunnel)
 It is plug and play and works fine with Windows 7 64 bit.

$REVIEW.: The Deltas are Brainwavz' budget earbuds, listing for around forty dollars and selling on Amazon for half that (as of this writing).I've evaluated several other Brainwavz products, including their high end earbuds, which I thought were really an excellent product


So I was curious to see what they could do for a list price about a hundred dollars lower.The bottom line is that I'm really surprised at how good the Deltas are

Certainly, I expected more than the super-bad performance and non-existent durability of cheap ten dollar units
But I didn't expect to find something that I'd necessarily want to keep using.The build quality is good for the price

The earbuds themselves are made of metal, not cheap plastic, and although the wiring is thin and possibly fragile, the critical points are equipped with seemingly effective strain reliefs
I can't see these lasting as long as the Brainwavz high-end models, but I can see them outlasting the cheap ones by many months with reasonable care

 One nice touch: the plug is angled, making it easier to insert and remove


On my finicky old Droid phone, the plug maintains better contact than straight plugs (perhaps having less of a lever arm when jostled).One objection: the &#34;L&#34; and &#34;R&#34; for left and right are so faintly marked on the earbuds that my aging eyes can't see them except under a bright halogen lamp.But what really, really counts is sound quality


So let's be honest: these are not audiophile earbuds


What they are, though, are good sounding earbuds.Like all of Brainwavz' earbuds, from low price to high end, you need to fit them properly, and Brainwavz supplies a selection of different sized tips
Take the time to get this right; the sound quality is very much affected by the fit, as is the degree of isolation.Once fitted properly I listened to my usual variety of source material
I found decent bass, at least in earbud terms, in fact, better bass than on my Bose Lifestyle earbuds
The high end was also nice, although there was no harmonic shimmer and only a little &#34;airiness.&#34; But the definition and clarity were excellent


I could not believe that I was listening to budget earbuds.The upper mids were likewise good


The lower-mids were not so good; they seemed murky
So, while the overall sound quality is very good indeed, I found that the lower mid murkiness lead to some ear fatigue after about two hours of listening at normal (non-earpiercing and safe) volume levels
The sound-stage sense (width and depth) also suffered.The earbuds are very sensitive and produce plenty of volume even from some wimpy input sources

I did not detect any propensity to overdrive; these handle a wide range of input levels.Isolation, again when properly fit, was very good, even better than some headphones I've tried.So here's my conclusion


If you want audiophile sound, buy an expensive set or better still use good headphones


However, if you're on a budget, or just want a spare set of earbuds for everyday, casual listening without breaking the bank, and want something with good sound and durability, the Deltas are for you
They provide amazing value

I give them five stars based on what you get for your money.I was sent an evaluation set by the manufacturer, but I write only straight and unbiased reviews.

Here are my issues:1) When the iPad is open, the magnetic closure flap on the case always flops in front of the screen.2) Positioning in stand-up mode is a pain to do and doesn't always sit flat.The look and feel are OK but I've seen and used better cases.

$REVIEW.: I tried some cheap generic converters, but they were always soft on the edges and not worth the trouble. This one is great though -- noticeably increases the FOV without degrading the image. I may one day get a true wide angle lens, but until then this is a good supplement to the kit lens that fits in a bag nicely.The only thing that confused me at first is that it takes a little more pressure to snap on than the macro converter does. I thought it wobbled and was loose at first, but after carefully giving more pressure it locked into place with a snap. Taking it off was much easier.

$REVIEW.: I bought the BlueBuds to use for exercising and I am amazed at how good they are. First time you put them on they might be a little awkward, but one you get used to them they are very comfortable, have great sound, and the battery last for a really long time. Sometimes within a run I have to squeeze them back in the ear, but that's sporadic. I was worried they would not last for long (I'm normally rough on headphones and end up breaking them), but these are working great and are like new after months of use. I would suggest that these work better for someone that is used to (or prefers) in-ear headphones.

$review_text.: I didn't find the sound quality as any different from typical earpieces, but I did find the cord too short so that as I moved around, the earpieces kept getting pulled out of my ear (the other end plugged into my cell phone in my pants pocket).I wish it had a foot longer cord, with a little clip at the base of the &#34;Y&#34; to attach to your collar so it doesn't get pulled off as you move your arms, even if the wire is routed around the back of your head.  There are a total of three pairs of different size silicone caps to fit inside your ear. I find them extremely difficult to replace.Is it worth the sub-$10 price?  Yes.Could it be a little better for that price? Absolutely.Would I buy this again? No.

$REVIEW.: The title may be confusing for some - let me explain
 I previously owned a DP-1s
 I was very happy with this little camera, both in image quality and build

 I regretted getting rid of the camera as soon as it left my possession


 Fast forward a year or so and I couldn't pass up a sale on the DP-1x.The DP-1x takes great pictures, but for some reason they are not as good as the DP-1s


 Don't get me wrong - the image quality is still great, but the '1x pictures don't "pop" like the '1s pictures do
 The build quality was also not on par with the '1s


 The buttons on the back rattled around and seemed made of cheaper materials.Interface was about the same and the buttons were labeled a bit better than the '1s


 Price was about $50 more, even though I got both on sale.Bottom line is that this is a good camera, just didn't meet my expectations from the DP-1s
 Still 4 stars though.

$review_text.: I bought this KVM switch as a replacement for my old IOGear switch. Plugged it in and it seemed to work nicely! I liked the big buttons and the LED indicators which show what is currently active. The beeping noise is definitely too loud, but for a 2560x1600 switch (according to box - I was only able to test 1920x1200) that is acceptable.On the next day I was not able to see anything on the screen - in fact it claimed that it was in power safe. After some forced re-boots and lots of testing I have found out that there needs to be an active computer on the first port in order to see anything. So in other words: When you see something on port 2 or 3 or 4 and you turn off the first system the screen goes black.Next chatted with a Belkin customer support representative. After 20 minutes of fruitless discussions he said that the KVM would not work with Windows7 - only with the other identified operating systems (DOS - Vista, Unix, ..). From a technical standpoint that is ... total nonsense. To make things even worse: My configuration is - XP, Mac OSX, Win7, WinXP.My recommendation: No Belkin for me anymore - and even if it is for such a customer support.The KVM will of course go back - since it obviously does not work.

Unless Lenovo made the power bricks look similar for the W530 and W510, but different for the W520 in between, I suspect that this is a knock-off.I could definitely be wrong but I'm skeptical.

$REVIEW.: I just installed this unit in my kitchen and I love it! The sound is great and reception is way  better than the boom box I used to have. One other benefit that doesn't show in any of the pictures is that it comes with a little side attachment that is optional. It's for holding an MP3 player on the side where the play would plug in.I love that the remote has a magnet on the back. Also, I like that it has an internal battery (that can be replaced when it wears out) so that it keeps time when the power goes out.If there is one drawback that I have found it's that it doesn't have a feature for scanning for radio channels. It just has up and down tune buttons. AM reception isn't so great, but I haven't found any unit that picks up AM well. The remote does not include the batters. No big deal.Installation was easy with the template provided. Also, the system for adjusting for the depth under the cabinet is super easy to us and will make this unit fit perfectly under any cabinet.

$review_text.: After much searching review reading and procrastination I picked this over all other and many options.I am not sorry. The best decision was to choose the LTE version with SIM Card slot for mobility data. (But back to that in a minute).The review after a couple months of hard use is as follows:Immediately went to Verizon store and added a data plan as a separate account. Sim card install for $35 and monthly plan with 2 gB data only $30/month. Now I am completely mobile free of wifi if need be.Left for Tuscany Italy and went to the TIM Italian phone store and purchased a SIM card and data plan monthly for 17 Euros first month and extra data. (Did the same thing for my HTC Droid DNA.) Using MagicJack I could make free calls to all my MJ people and very low cost/Minute to everyone else.As long as I had TIM coverage (3G and 2G) I was good to go.Nexus 7 2nd genPROSVery  good battery life and good support with Google and Apps (although I did not buy from google but Amazon). I purchased Square Trade Warranty and would strong recommend that you do also.Great screen, super fast response, tons of apps, reasonably good speaker, fast download, nice feel, Bluetooth works well (I purchased a Bear Motion  Premium Folio Case with Detachable Bluetooth Keyboard for Google Nexus 7 II 2013 Version for $30 and it works well on Bluetooth ....has its own rechargeable battery). Gives protection and a good keyboard.Installed Chrome, Outlook, and it picked up all my apps from my desktop and HTC Smart Phone. Almost to easy.Worked all over Italy, and saved me a few times with Google Maps, Yelp, Trip Advisor, got mail and plotted trips.Returned to USA, swapped out the SIM and was back on Verizon in ten minutes.It downloaded KitKat upgrade within days of purchase. The day I went into Verizon they had just agreed to support this model tablet.ConsI had trouble with the audio jack to the point that it was dead. Called Asus and got service. They were prepared to take it back (to Texas) for repair or replace but I was leaving for Italy so I got a case number and postponed return. During the trip I got the Audio jack to work although it is touchy.Sound could be a little louder but not so bad.Bottom line is that I am recommending to all who ask.

$REVIEW.: This is my first light meter, so take this with a grain of salt, but so far it has been excellent. It does everything I need (especially flash metering) and even some things that I don't need.I spent quite a while looking at meters in the $100-$300 range that at least did flash metering, and I came to the conclusion that it makes much more sense to buy this all-in-one meter with extra features for $300 than buy a flash-only meter for less and then have to buy an incident light meter later especially when both together for a total cost of $300 or less would probably do less than this one meter does for the same cost. This was the best value in light meters that I could find, and I looked at quite a few. It seems that all of the research paid off and I made a good decision.My only wishes are that: 1) I wish I could set the shutter speed and aperture and have it tell me what ISO sensitivity is needed for the given lighting conditions; 2) it "only" goes up to f/90. Issue #1 is easy to work around (just hold down an iso button and turn it up from 100 until the aperture and shutter speed you need are displayed). Issue #2 really only matters because I have a f/177 pinhole camera "lens" that the meter is very useful for calculating the exposure time for... I just have to multiply whatever exposure time it gives me for f/90 by 4 (which would technically be the time for f/180 but that's close enough given my unwillingness to do the math to adjust it for exactly f/177).Given that there's an easy workaround for both, and the latter only comes in to play rarely, neither of these are a big deal. After all, the designers can't possibly imagine every possible thing that someone might want, and the meter already has a bunch of other features (like memory, averaging, EV delta v, multi-flash metering, etc.) that have either already come in handy for me or probably will rather soon.I also wish it used standard AA batteries (since I have a bunch of rechargables) but I don't consider the lack of commonly available battery support to be that big of a deal.If you need a light meter that does ambient/incident light, reflected light, and flash (with or without synchronization) then this has to be one of the best, if not the best, that you can get for the price.

$REVIEW.: I'll admit a degree of suspicion when I order the unit.  What do you expect for $90?  Well, I think I got a lot; I was totally surprised by the functionality and accuracy of this little gadget.The first thing I did was download the latest and greatest maps from the TomTom site.  It took awhile over my DSL but it did not require much interaction which I liked.  Think my wife can even do it (I know, I know).We have made several trips with it and it has become a basic necessity of long distance driving.  When I pass a speed limit change on the interstate, it immediately provides a visual indication that I am speeding.  It provides concise (spoken) descriptions of events that need to occur on those complicated highway interchanges.  Missed that turn, no problem, it will immediately recalculate a new route and provide instructions.I highly recommend the device be mounted immediately in front (lower windshield) of driver so you do not have to cut your eyes away from the road.Highly recommend this GPS.

$REVIEW.: I stumbled across this device last year when looking for solid state audio/video players for use in a a haunted house attraction. Instead of having to burn custom CDs, and then play/repeat them, or create custom DVDs that would loop, we wanted something that would turn on and just start playing. This cheap box does the trick! You can copy compatible audio or video files to it, and configure it to auto-play and repeat. Boom, instant video kiosk, or background music without anyone ever having to press a button.We ended up ordering about a dozen of these, and uses them for playing video loops, background audio, sound effects, etc.WARNING: The devices I received were configured for PAL (non-USA) video mode. On the CRT TV I was using, the picture was unreadable until you navigate menus with the remote control and set it to NTSC. I had already configured a box at home (it was readable on my HDTV), so I was able to learn how many times I had to press the buttons and in what order to get to the menu and switch the settings. That was a pain in the neck to do for a dozen boxes when you couldn't read the menus due to the screen being all messed up. BUT, once set up, it remembers the setting.It is picky about video files. I was making files using Final Cut Express (and, later, Pro X) and using the same settings would sometimes work, and sometimes not. In some cases, the non-working video would still show up on the NBOX menu and even preview in the little thumbnail box, but choosing it would not play. Very frustrating. But, I did find certain formats (DVD video) always seemed to work. That's the hardest part about this -- these cheap video playback chips are not quite as forgiving.So, fantastic device for replacing a CD or DVD player. We now use them for many different things -- running video loops in a store, for example. Update a video, swap out the SD card, and ready to go -- no more burning DVDs.It's a great gadget. (Note: there are bigger, better NBOXes, but according to a chart I read, some of the fancier ones that support more formats, do NOT have the auto play capability, which was crucial for our needs).
$review_summary.: Self-playing audio/video loops! Great for haunted houses, kiosks, etc.

$review_text.: I purchased this card to work with 4 2TB drives with the intention of RAID 5, stripping with parity.  The drive would not boot into Windows 7 with that configuration, even after flashing the controller.  Raid 0 and Raid 1 would boot.Concatenating the drives, RAID 0 stripping, to build an 8TB drive reported to windows as a 6TB and a 2TB.  It would not report as an 8TB drive.I settled on two RAID 1 drives of 2 TB each and changed the task of the drives.  The card as been working for about a week now and performs very well.  I have run 4 simultaneous video streams on and off the drives successfully.Thus it does one of my tasks and is the only reason I don't rate it a 1.Tech support is not existent.  The product is sold and delivered by Amazon so you can send it back but that looks like the totality of support.

$review_text.: The surface is an amazing tool.  My personal productivity has seen a significant increase since incorporating it into my life. Onenote is the best thing that has ever existed for taking notes. Write, erase, select, resize, move, etc. Perfect.  I take notes all the time now. Hand written.  It has helped my professional and my every day life, and I am grateful for it. Also, drawing in sketchbook express, the free metro app, is wonderful as an artist. Especially considering the wacom digitizer for pressure sensitivity the SP2 has built in. And the metro app for netflix is excellent. Much better than the web browser version.I opted against the keyboard cover and bought a Bluetooth keyboard and laptop mouse instead. And a small CaseCrown messenger bag in which it all snugly fits.  When I need a tablet, I use a tablet. And when I need a desktop I have a wireless keyboard(logitech k810) and mouse(microsoft 4000) which are desktop quality or better. Truly it is a comfortable setup, and the surface brings the raw power.  What is also important to me is that my mouse and keyboard will remain useful for future devices as long as Bluetooth and USB are still being used. My last wireless mouse has lasted 13 years and I still use it, too.But what is really cool is that my surface lets me use my PC software to the fullest and it also acts as a tablet when I just want a tablet.  It is an absolute game changer for me in my life.  The only 'every-day' things that my PC does better than my surface is gaming with new games, and very large art projects. And my PC is very nice, I assure you. I now use the surface for everything else, wherever I want, whenever I want, and with a really nice wireless, backlit keyboard. And the keys are spaced as a full size keyboard. I actually bought a Bluetooth dongle for my PC so I could use my logitech k810 wireless keyboard on it as well. It's totally sweet.The surface is something beyond a tablet. It is a full, portable computer which can attach to keyboards and mice and whatever else through USB, Bluetooth, Wifi, MiniDisplayport, and Wireless Display. Probably more, too.  Depending on how you want to use it.  In a sense, it is the most elemental PC that has ever existed. And as a PC user, I say thanks.

It will take some band with but much less than a wireless extender
I use a wireless router as an acess point and increase my signal
If you want to do this its pretty simple.1
set the DHCP on your main router to a range (say 2-100)2


set the second router to be used as a access point (give an SSID you will know)3 give the second router a static IP outside the DHCP range say 200 (ensure the DHCP is off on second router.)4

ensure its on same subnet mask5 plug in you adapers and get connected6 plug in router and ping it from a computer connected to 1st router7 if receive reply connect you devices to second router

They will connect to the one that has the best signal.6 plug in router

The shape of it is very odd, and there is about an inch of space left at the top, which makes the case too long. The kindle does fit snugly inside, and is easily removed and replaced into the sleeve without any problems. The lining inside is quite nice -light blue fleece-like material that looks like it will protect the Kindle well during falls/drops. Hopefully this sleeve will get redesigned into to a square instead of an odd looking hourglass.

$REVIEW.: I love my iPod touch, I had a 2nd gen but that broke in several ways exactly 2 years later.  The battery life is SO much better with this one.  The camera is no good at all for taking still shots (ALWAYS blurs) but video looks incredible. Facetime is giving me a ton of pain.  Everytime I search for a contact it brings up Facetime instead of just showing me their information.  I instead go into the contact app directly instead of using spotlight. Web browsing is certainly much faster than my 2nd gen do to I believe double the GHz in the CPU.This replaces my need for a smartPhone until I'm due for an upgrade.  When that happens I plan to get the latest Verizon Droid phone and give my little brother this iPod touch for his Christmas gift. I actually really like Droids (Android in general) more than iPhones.  The open-source base is the best method for developing software, not restrictions the man in the turtle-neck imposes because he says so.I love using SplashID and having it encrypt a database of all hundreds of different passwords and other information.  My memory is very poor it this device makes my life livable. Between SplashID, Google syncing with mail, calendar, and contacts, and facebook, it completes me.

$REVIEW.: This little camera works well, and, in combination with mirrors and looking over the shoulder, it gives me more confidence in backing

My vehicle has poor rear visibility, and I can't turn my head as far as when I was younger.I do think that Peak opens themselves up to bad reviews by stating that it "installs in minutes."  Mine is on an 07 Pontiac Vibe, which is sort of a mini SUV

My brother, a mechanical engineer who rebuilds old cars for a hobby, needed the better part of an afternoon to do the job.If you have a Vibe, you know that the curvature of the dash makes monitor placement a problem
 Mine is mounted on the front part of the dash just to the left of the steering wheel (with a tiny screw)

The cord is routed through a tiny hole drilled down on the side of the dash

This works well.I definitely recommend this if you are very knowledgeable about cars or have someone to install it for you.

Without a lot of use, and very careful handling, after about 15 months we had to wiggle the card to get the reader to recognize it. Then we used it once or twice for short projects and it was ok. However, last week, when we attempted to record to the full three hours, it stopped about half way through and now is not recognized by the camera.I started the return process with SanDisk (these have a 5 year warranty) and hope to get a new one from SanDisk.

$REVIEW.: What better device to pair an Intel CPU with than an Intel motherboard? I've used products from ASUS and Gigabyte and liked them very much, but Intel offers similar performance for a better price.This motherboard houses my 3770k CPU overclocked to 4.2 GHz on air, as well as two Nvidia 560ti GPUs, overclocked to 900-1000 MHz on air. The GUI-enabled UEFI BIOS makes setup a breeze and the PWM fan headers allow my high-flow fans to keep my computer running cool while being surprisingly quiet. The onboard storage controllers manage my SSD boot drive as well as my RAID 1 array without any problems.I've had no stability issues, and the wonderful BIOS is very forgiving of any mistakes made while setting up.

$review_text.: I have been researching PDA's for about 3 weeks now, trying to figure out if I should switch from palm to pocket pc


 Well, I had my mind set out on a pocket pc, and went to the store to sample some others before I made my purchase.I completely fell for this palm-based PDA and was about to buy it

 It has the BEST feel to it! It's not too big or small, the keypad is VERY comfortable, unlike the small Clie keys (I have big fingers, it was not a problem for me to type anything)


 I was going to buy it right there and then, until the sales associate told me that it DOES NOT support MP3's, stereo sound or movies! I was SO disapointed because it has the BEST feel to it ever!If you do not need it for multimedia, I would definitely say to buy it

 The Built-in WiFi, the form factor are just AMAZING on this palm

 I cannot believe they added a small mono headphone jack to it, with no stereo sound.If this palm was media compatilible, it could completely replace your need for a &quot;full-size&quot; PC

Even the software that came with it is great.Because of the non-media capabilities I give it 3 stars, and opt to buy the HP Ipaq 4355, which is a big longer than this model, but has all of the same features WITH media support.Come on Palm, you can do better than that! I didn't want to switch over but you made me....

$REVIEW.: the first thing i noticed about the keyboard was that the cord was infinitely too short.the second thing was that it was a lot harder to use than expected. other reviews had led me to believe it was easy to push the keys. it IS easy, if you hunt-peck or type while looking at the keys. for touch typing, it was extremely difficult.the third thing was that the glow feature would randomly turn on for no reason. it would just start glowing.and the clincher, it's so unfortunate, the reason i will not buy this keyboard again is that it was completely inaccessible to my visually impaired friend. the reason is that the space bar is in more than one key, so is shift, and some other keys as well. it was completely unusable for her, which disappointed both of us greatly.another friend of mine who is quadriplegic tried it once with her mouth-stick. it seemed to work well for her.overall, if you can see okay, type slowly, and don't mind the random glowing, this is an awesome keyboard. sigh. mine is now listed on freecycle.

$review_text.: My husband and I installed this security system in our home and used two of the four supplied cameras. We also used a wireless camera that we had from a previous system in order to overcome a limitation where we could not run the wire from the camera to the box. We would have preferred at least one wireless camera to be included so that we could have installed a camera of the same quality.The initial setup was a little complicated because the unit switched to a screen resolution that my television did not support; however, using a computer monitor allowed me to get the initial setup completed correctly. Once configured, the system is easy to use and I was able to connect to my android smart phones, tablet, and a laptop, with only moderate skill required and view live feed. The included cameras provide crystal clear images in both color and black and white depending on light level. The DVR record and playback works well and the ability to save video clips and still images directly on my cell phone is a plus.I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because of the installation quirks and for no audio capabilities on the included cameras.

But it chokes on the full HD movie mode , even though technically the class 10 specification *should* mean it would have no problem


I've also had another class 6 Transcend card that I used on an older Sanyo XACTI HD 1000, and that one had issues too, prompting the camera to warn me of "insufficient card speed " 
I'm staying away from Transcend for anything related to HD video, which means that I'm staying away permanently because having one card in a camera that can do both 18 MP stills and Full HD Video means I can't use the video component of my HD-DSLR, at all.I should have known better than to think they somehow could output cards that cost half to one third that of leading manufacturers with the same specifications.Goodbye Transcend, hello SanDisk.

$REVIEW.: For Christmas we bought ourselves a new 1080P HD TV (Samsung) and a Samsung internet-enabled Blu-Ray player. With no experience with internet TV, we experimented on the Samsung to see if less cable was in our future. I found the Samsung interface slow, non-intuitive, and they seem to block access to content that is free other than YouTube. There's a frustrating web browser, and you can plug in a wireless mouse and keyboard to decrease the frustration, but you can't download Flash which is required to play Downton Abbey on PBS.org. Also, the Samsung connects to Amazon.com, but you can't play any of your Prime videos.Solution, the Roku 2 XS. It works on either WiFi or Ethernet, which is my choice. I use a wireline network to get Ethernet throughout the whole house.Setting up the Roku and the channels requires the use of a &#34;real&#34; browser on your PC, but they give you some codes and you enter them on your browser. Piece of cake.If you want HD, you have to provide your own HDMI cable (Hint: get the inexpensive cable from Amazon, not the expensive ones from your local electronics store.)Within minutes, we were up and running. The provided &#34;free&#34; stations seem only to have free *previews* for the most part. There is a Popcorn station which has free HD movies, mostly I've never heard of. The Crackle station has free stuff I've heard of, but I can't get it to play more than a few seconds. But these are channel issues, not issues with the Roku.I don't have an account with Hulu or Vudu, but I have Amazon Prime videos.The Roku interface seems intuitive enough for navigating the Amazon video selections, selections appear quickly, and I positively LOVE the little remote. (Samsung could learn a thing or two from Roku on remotes, user interfaces, and speed of connections.)The Amazon video plays in full 1080P with no buffering using Ethernet to connect to  my wireline network, a better picture than cable, and a simple, easy-to-use user experience. Wow! Using the Roku and the HD tuner in our TV to get local stations off the air, and I think we can disconnect cable! (Haven't been brave enough to cut the cord yet, but I think it would be possible.)Needless to say, we no longer use the Samsung for streaming video, because the Roku is so fast, easy, and high quality.Unreservedly recommended if you have an Amazon Prime (also highly recommended) account. I imagine if you have a Vudu or Hulu account the experience would be similar, but I can't report on that.

$REVIEW.: About three weeks ago I finished up a 50 pack of DL DVDs from TDK. They worked well overall. I only recall three coasters out of the batch. However, when I went to buy another spindle of DL DVDs, I decided to try the Kodak brand. Again.About 2-3 years ago, I had gone through about 100 of these from Kodak and they were really, really good. I reordered another 100 since the price was right and I had been happy with the previous batch. This time, it was about 80% coasters. I called Kodak and was told that it was a bad batch and they would replace them for free. They did and I was reasonably happy. Not happy enough to risk having to go through all that again so I've used other brands since then.But it's been a while and I thought that maybe, just maybe, things were back on the good side. And I like to support companies based in the US even if some of the product they sell is made elsewhere. Sadly, the quality has not returned.So far I've tried burning 10 discs from this spindle and I have 10 coasters. About the only thing I can say here that even remotely sounds positive is that at least they are consistent.My recommendation is to buy anything but the Kodak discs. You'll be glad you did.

$review_text.: If you have a compact camera, this case gets the job done. It's neoprene so it's a bit like a wetsuit. I'd trust it to keep out the dust and lessen minor shocks from small drops. On the flip side, there isn't really any indication of which way the camera should sit inside except maybe the the flash logo, but it appears to be on the wrong side (I can't imagine you'd want the lens on the stiff side of the case). There are also two tags on the inside on the case.. Is this a clothing item? Because even a HANES T-shirt is tag-less these days, and having tags inside of my camera case is just...irritating. I cut them off with a pair of scissors. The stitching on the inside seems a little loose (that's quality Chinese stitching for you) so I doubt I'll get decades of use before it all starts unraveling. But it gets the job done, and is inexpensive, so my complaints are minor.

 With some tweaking the color, brightness, and contrast are OK

 However, I've been underwhelmed by the font clarity
 My old Dell LCD from 2005 was very nice, but this one is just so so

 I've fiddled with Cleartype quite a bit, as well as the phase and pixel clock settings in the monitor, and the fonts never look smooth

$REVIEW.: Owned this one for almost a year now and I am generally happy with it.Won't repeat the good points by so many reviewers and articles
Here's the list of problems I found based on my use:1


The sensor gets dirty easily (I do switch lenses often, never in any dusty environment though), and hard to clean.2

Shutter button becomes sticky just now, won't release once pressed sometimes.3


View finder is small and hard to manual focus in regular day light, impossible in dim in door setting for me.4

The menu has most of the things I need, but not quick to get to during shooting
I have to give up so many good opportunities just to adjust the settings: focus (single point to muli-point), white balance


Yes, the custom white balance works great

But I didn't realize I have to rely on it in most of the in door settings
Auto WB fails in door most of the time with strong color bias without flash

When different rooms have different lighting condition, I have to set each one up before I can make my shots
And it ain't easy or quick


This is the pain in the ..
Tried Olympus Evolt E500 and the auto white balance on it was worse
Maybe this is an inheritant DSLR problem because of the current limitation of the sensor technology?5

The building flash is kinda weak, but the recycle is fast

The external flash just is too big and slow

Wish Canon will make the new ones more powerful in the future.6

The camera's software gives me errors from time to time, regardless which lenses I use, Canon or Sigma


Pull the battery and restart usually solves the problem


But at one time, it went totally crazy, none of the lenses I have can auto focus

I ended up reinstall the firmware and it solved the problem.I am going to send it back for service, and hope things will get better after that.All in all, this really is an entry level DSLR, something supposed to be a lot more expensive
Canon managed to make it affordable for us mortals with a catch

I think I'll move to the 30D line when it comes out with auto sensor cleaning

The full frame is great (better view finder and faster AF, among other things), but it places too much pressure on the lenses
I just can't afford the right lenses for the full frame


Haven't heard any rumors on 40D yet

The new 400D XTi supposes to have better AF and sensor cleaning
But I am far more cautious about the Rebel line in general now
Perhaps Canon made too many comprimises to make this line affordable.By the way, I took over 80,000 pictures with this camera in less than a year
So I real used it.--------------------------------Update Sept 2008Finally updated to 40D, right before 50D was announced, thanks alot Canon :) AF is so much better on the 40D! But everything else is still the same, except there are more buttons so I can have better control more easily, most of the time


AWB still sucks, so I shoot RAW these days


Just take much much more time for the home work afterwards
But I wouldn't blame 350D for its limitations
Because no matter which way you cut it, it's in a different world from any point and shoot, even with the humble kit lens

For those who want to have something to shoot their small kids, go get an entry level DSLR like this one, or maybe a Nikon if you haven't already got so many EF/EFS lenses like myself

With those point and shoot, you have missed way more great shots than you realized


I only got mine when my slow little Olympus died on me
Then I discovered DSLR
But by that time my daughter is already 1 year old! Get it before the baby comes out and do some practice before the big bang


You won't regret it.

$review_text.: While it does work, ASUS should have made this smaller. It simply sticks out of the dock connector too much and places the connector in harms way. Inside, the dongle uses an ACT4060A SMPS regulator IC to buck the tablet's battery voltage to 5V for the USB. There are some other lines for pull-up/down for the tablet to know what is connected. It's a pretty basic and low-cost circuit inside that can be easily duplicated. I might make myself a cable the has a right angle dock connector and places the regulator circuit further away from the tablet and inline of the cable. Just need some free-time to do so.

$review_text.: I have gotten 3 of these from Amazon, and the last of the 3 is on its way back to them now
 If you are hesitant to buy such a delicate and high-dollar item online, then don't let all these glowing reviews persuade you-- your first instinct is absolutely correct.1st TV: Arrived within 4 days, Eagle brought it in, hooked it up, and I noticed a buzzing coming from the back
 This is my first plasma TV, so I didn't know if that was normal but I did know it was annoying


 I called Samsung and asked them if I should hear anything from the back and they said no


 so I refused delivery and sent it back
 I called Amazon 5 minutes later and they were great-- already knew I had refused delivery and quickly processed a replacement


 They also approved after-hours delivery so I wouldn't have to stay home from work like I did on the first one.2nd TV: Also only took 4 days
 Eagle brought this one at night, and the light isn't so good in our living room


They hooked it up and there was no buzzing
The picture looked great, so being too excited I accepted it


 Then a few hours later, I noticed the top bulged up a little

 I went to inspect and noticed that the back of the TV was mashed in, as if the TV had fallen on its back at some point


 I called Amazon and told them, and they said they would pass the information on to their TV department

 The next day I got an e-mail offering me a refund but no exchange

 I called to ask for one more try, then got an e-mail offering me a $375 discount to keep the TV, or a refund, but no exchange


 I called again and finally got the exchange.3rd TV: It arrived, Eagle hooked it up, and it buzzed loudly

 On this one, the buzzing got louder when changing channels or switching to DVD
I also noticed some very odd things: black plastic pieces on the back that were worn down to white, missing labels on the front of the TV that the first two had, odd plastic shavings at the base of the screen, and a few places on the screen that needed to be wiped off

I'm nearly positive this one was refurbished


 I refused delivery
 Eagle will be picking up #2 on Monday and I'm just going to a physical store to buy one.Moral of the story, pay the extra money and buy your TV in a store


 when I started all this at the end of February, the cheapest any store had it was $700 more than Amazon

 Now, not a month later, it's only $200 more.4th TV - I went to a store and bought one of these that night for $100 more than Amazon has it (they went up $120 for some reason)

 It was delivered on Saturday by much more knowledgeable guys, and it is flawless!  Absolutely zero buzzing, no scratches, no dents
 This TV is in 10 times better shape than any of the 3 I got before
 These come from different places, I don't know how that works or what determines it but the first three had Enlish and French on the box, the 4th perfect one only had English

 The TV is amazing, and in the store the picture quality blew the other brands away

Worth 5 stars when you get a good one!

 Compared to my Performance MX mouse, which is three times the price, this mouse performs admirably
 It is very fast and nimble
 The scrolling is extremely fast

 Easily recommended for those who prefer a smaller and faster mouse


 For overall comfort and quality I still prefer the more expensive MX.

but if you are running Win 7 32 and you want to add wireless networking capabilities as easily as possible, this device will work for you.

$REVIEW.: I bought this TV for use in a grid-down, hurricane situation. We have lots of AA Eneloops with solar charging capability, so I wanted something that would take AA batteries. This one fit the bill. I can pretty much guarantee at least 4 hours a day running this TV on batteries alone in a grid down situation, if not more, with our capacity. This TV eats up the battery juice quickly, but it can be worth it if you plan ahead.As for reception it is surprisingly good for a handheld set. We do not get all of the channels that the main TVs get, but we get all of the major networks, which will suffice for hurricane season. Picture quality is amazing for such a small unit. Setup and initial scan are important to get right.For the money spent this is definitely worth it. Having a radio during a grid-down situation is nice, but having a TV is so much better.Pros: picture quality / screen clarity, sound features, ease of use, menus are easy to navigateCons: battery life (of course I'd like it to be longer)Ability to pick up channels can be a pro or con depending upon where you are; in my area I get enough to mark it as a pro...

$REVIEW.: Why choose a Moose Warming CP over a typical Circular Polarizer?It basically helps eliminate that "bluish" tint you can get sometimes with a traditional polarizing filter. It still can be "rotated" to change the amount of effect, but the tinting has a "more natural" feel to it. At least to me.the quality of the filter is much higher than the cheap CP's you'll find at Walmart or BB and it is robust enough you can get years of use out of them with no problems.When it is sunny out, I tend to leave my CPs on.I use them with L-series lenses on Canon equipment in the 58mm, 72mm, and 78mm sizes.

$review_text.: I frequently use my laptop out and about, but prefer to have a portable mouse for getting any serious work done

The trackpad just does not cut it for very long
I've been using a Logitech portable mouse, but wanted to compare its performance to the new BlueTrack technology


My overall impression of the mouse is that it is not as well thought out as Logitech's offerings

The mouse is a bit light in the hand and feels a bit cheap


The scroll wheel is a joke -- I much prefer having a metallic wheel with some heft to it


Additionally, the USB adapter (which, on the plus side, is very small) is difficult to remove from the body of the mouse


Another comparison to Logitech's offerings is that Logitech's mouse thoughtfully turns off the battery when you insert the adapter into the body of the mouse
Microsoft's requires you to insert the adapter and turn the unit off manually
It's a small point, but for me the grace of the design matters.The one thing that this mouse has going for it is the ability to track on some surfaces that other optical & laser mice cannot venture onto

But, quite frankly, I've never had a problem tracking with my current mouse
I don't use my laptop on glass tables and I'm perfectly happy grabbing a notepad from my backpack if there are any problems


Indeed, I typically use some kind of surface anyway to avoid gunking up the mouse.In summary, if the mouse were very cheap, I might be able to recommend it as an average mouse


But you're better off finding better alternatives in this price range


As with any device that you plan on using in your daily workflow, it's best to go to a brick-and-mortar store to try these out before buying online.

$review_text.: There is a developing wish list of firmware updates that have been suggested both here and at other sites on the web and 90% have both merit and are possible; so I will not rehash those items, but instead, I will turn my suggestions to hardware issues. This camera and I expect its successor(s) will be around for some time as the lens map provides clear indication. Let me premise the comments that follow with the statement that: "I am not looking for a small camera; that will never be a deciding factor for me." The 1st thing I would like to see is an off camera flash cord because as another "never"; I will never use a flash perched atop of a camera. It will be mounted on bracket, thus the need for the cord. Second I would like to see someone like Jenis develop a two battery switchable grip that would provide not only the two battery capacity but also a larger camera grip. I will not spring for the add on Fuji grip but would pay for a unit that increase battery carry and provides the grip feature.  I am anxious to get my hands on lens adapters that will accommodate Nikon, Olympus, Contax G2, lenses as well as lens offerings from Zeiss and Voightlander.Yes sir; picture my XP1, mounted on a bracket with a battery pack and cord attached to a bracket mounted flash for fill flash purposes/situations...no my XP1 would not be a small camera, but then I still love a fully loaded Nikon F5. The XP1 and I have already become good friends an none of the camera's quirks, and they all have their own, has posed a problem in the learning and set up curve.OH, and SilkyPix; it will vanish a soon as Adobe offers up the "raw .raf" conversion...enough said on that issue.I have already communicated that matter to/with Fuji in Japan.

$REVIEW.: Wanted an inexpensive case to protect the Kindle touch while traveling. It was as described, utilitarian, flip case, stands like an easel. However, adds a lot of bulk to this nice small light reader, I don't think I will use the case while using the Kindle. I will probably take it out if reading for any length of time. The device slips into a sleeve, which takes the device from .25 inches to over half an inch thick. The sleeve attaches to a cover with Velcro, which does not hold tightly. With the cover flipped to the back of the device the whole thing is about 1.25 or more inches thick. You can easily take off the cover and read the Kindle in the sleeve, but it is a bit thick to get one hand around comfortably. Doesn't smell like plastic, material is a pleather, cover closes with a magnet. So not luxurious feeling, but not bad for the price.

$REVIEW.: Prior to using this device, I was trying to use an auxiliary-to-auxiliary connection to listen to my iPod in the car. The sound quality was horrible. I had to crank up the volume on my car radio to 50 to even be able to hear it. Plus, the music was flat, lacking bass and tenor.This device works great. I can hear my iPod music quite clearly at the same settings I would use to play a CD in the car. The sound is terrific, taking full advantage of car's stereo system. No, the this connector does not charge the iPod while playing, and I still have to use the iPod to change playlists and repeat/skip ahead. But to be able to listen to my iPod and get the full sound of the music made that trade-off well worth it. And the price is a lot less than buying the bluetooth systems out there that run from $45.00 and up.

$REVIEW.: I bought these to replace a Klipsch Promedia 5.1 system. Given the living situation I'm in now I have no use for surround sound and the on-the-floor subwoofer proved annoying for the neighbors below me.My Klipsch system was great but succomed to the amp failure and constant loud buzzing sound that all Promedia setups eventually come to. I needed a replacement system that could still offer nice balance on sound, without bothering the neighbors around me. For the price, I don't think you'll ever find a better set than this. They sound great, offer a nice balance of highs and lows, and offer multiple input options (which was key for me since I run my Xbox 360 and cable box through these same speakers). The look fantastic and are easy to set up. If you're looking for a 2 speaker system for an affordable price that will deliver great sound, this is your set. Bang for the buck, these are about as good as I've ever heard. Just buy them, you won't be sorry.

 Despite the name the packaging claims it supports various other tablets of roughly Kindle Fire dimensions but alas all I can comment on is the Kindle Fire

 The fit is quite snug
 Really to the point where my sister wasn't sure it actually fit until I uncaged my manly rage on it and finally got it to fit

 Needless to say I was pretty confident that the table wasn't going anywhere once it was in there

 All things considered the build quality and fit are commendable and the only real complaint I have against it is the lack of basic conveniences like like a clasp of any sort or perhaps a stylus receptacle
 It does however have a vertical pocket for loose notes or what have you


 If you can live without a secure closure I would definitely recommend this case.

$review_text.: Overall, no complaints about this card.


 Installed it, connected a Molex connector, and installed the latest VIA drivers from station-drivers.


If you are just receiving the card, there are numerous drivers on the disc -- just choose the VLI folder and you'll get what you need

 I bought this primarily for a 20-pin header to provide USB 3 to my front panel ports, but having the rear ports is convenient as well

 Overall, a nice product from Orico -- plus they reached out to me upon placing my order to let me know which drivers to install - before I even received the card -- that was a good sign on support.

$SUMMARY.: Works great, easy install

$review_text.: The MADE Camera Armor for the Canon 450D (XSI) works very well for protecting your camera from light bumps and scratches. It does so without adding very much bulk to the camera. The armor comes in 4 pieces:(1) a piece for protecting the body of the camera(2) a piece for protecting the lens(3) a piece for protecting the base of the camera - This piece extends the tripod screw so you can use a tripod with your camera even with the armor on.(4) LCD screen protector.Pros----- Protects CameraThe armor not only protects your camera from light bumps and scratches, it will shield your camera from fingerprints, smudges, dirt, and other undesirables.- Improves GripThe texture of the silicone also helps to greatly improve your grip on the camera so you can have a secure and firm hold on the camera.- Protects LensThe armor covers the lens as well. A couple of people noted that the lens protection is flawed because it makes changing lenses very hard or impossible. The manufacturer has since fixed the issue; I don't find it a problem to change lenses.- Tethers Lens CapThe lens cap can be tethered to the armor. This thoughtful feature makes removing and replacing the lens cap a snap!Cons----- Dust MagnetThe affinity of the armor to dust is an issue intrinsic to silicone skins. The armor can become quite unsightly unless you keep it relatively free of dust.- Slightly IrregularThis is a quibble - but I find that certain parts of the armor, particularly around the LCD screen and the base of the armor, a little irregular. The covering around the LCD skin is slightly crooked. There are gaps between the base piece of the armor and main piece covering the camera body.- Lens Change A HassleIt can be a hassle to move the lens protection from one lens to another. One solution might be to use lens hoods (such asthis one) for all your lenses and omit the armor for the lens altogether.---Despite a few minor issues, the MADE Camera Armor for the Canon 450D (XSI) is definitely worth consideration. It is relatively inexpensive and it will help to protect your investment to give you peace of mind. Recommended.

$REVIEW.: Prior to laying out $1200 for what, in my opinion, is a niche camera, I've been playing with one that I borrowed for a few days. The first thing I'll say is that the images are stunning. They compare favorably in every way with every camera that I can personally compare to (Olympus E510, Canon S90, Nikon D90), and with shots taken by others that have been posted to galleries. The images are, subjectively, unsurpassed.The various flaws reported by others are definitely there, but I find that I can mostly ignore them, considering the quality of the results. I haven't hit that nasty shutter defect - that obviously can't be ignored, and worries me (but it's not my camera ...).Will I buy this camera? No. Mainly because I'm not a professional. For almost all of what I do, an excellent P&S; like the Canon S90 (which I own), or S95 or S100 is fine. On the few occasions where I've had to do "professional" work (artists' portfolios), I might've appreciated and benefited from the X100, but made do quite nicely with an Olympus E510. Even the Canon S90 was up to the task (thanks to the possibility to process its RAW images with Adobe and DxO software to calibrate color, and to correct for vignetting and barrel distortion). For my personal camera, I need zoom and a smaller size. So I can't justify this price for something that I can't use all the time. If I had that kind of money, I might be looking at a Leica (but I've seen several reviews saying the X100 is easily the equal of those, and I can believe it now). But those are not flaws of this camera, and are not why I give it four stars. They're just why it's not for me.I rate this camera four stars not so much for the price alone, which is easily justified by the images, or because it's not the perfect camera for me, but because there are just a few too many quirks for the price (slow write speed and clunky UI being my biggest complaints). All of which could possibly be fixed with firmware updates, but, for some reason, haven't been. It's actually better than four stars - 4.5 I'd say - but I can't give it a 5. As much as the images deserve it. Superb, they are.

Cleaning it and using compressed air did not help.The replacement arrived well packed and teh installation was done in a matter of minutes. The new keyboard fits perfectly and looks 100% like the original one. The laptop is like new.I do recommend downloading the Lenovo service manual from the support site for detailed instructions of how to install it. The release mechanism is not intuitive, and you may end up removing more screws than you need to otherwise.

$review_text.: The people who are complaining that this os is for touch devices and not for desktops don't know what they're talking about
Yes, there is a learning curve, just as with any new os

I installed this on a new desktop build with no problem
Didn't have to create a MSN account and don't intend on using the app store

Since I'm the only user of this PC, I didn't have to create a password to login and the computer boots right up without asking me to enter a password and login

If I want a desktop application all I have to do is install it

Windows resize with no problem

If you don't like the full-window tablet-style apps, then don't use them


They can be easily uninstalled and replaced with desktop versions


I haven't found any problem navigating the os using a keyboard and mouse.It takes one click to navigate between the start screen and the desktop

How hard is that? It takes one right-click on the desktop start button to open a menu that has the shutdown/restart/log-off options
How hard is that? You close the full-window tablet-type apps by clicking at the top of the screen and dragging down to the bottom and it's gone
How hard is that? If you don't like the tiles on the start screen, you can unpin all of them and just have the apps list

You can use the mouse wheel to scroll left-right and vice versa through the apps list

How hard is that? I have no problem finding all my Libre Office and other desktop applications, so I don't understand these people who claim they can't get any productive work done using this os.I've been using Linux Mint 13 for the past year on another desktop and really like it, but it still has it's shortcomings as far as apps and support from software and hardware manufacturers and there are things like income tax software that just aren't available for Linux
So I decided to go with Windows 8.1 for my new desktop build


I'm not real geeky and pretty much old-school, and so far I like what I see with this os

It boots fast and runs without a hitch so far--this is my third day of using it.The fact that Windows 8.1 doesn't have Media Center included isn't a problem for me


I never liked Media Center and always had problems with it locking up when I tried to use it on previous versions of Windows.So for those people who are sitting on the fence or have been scared off by wrongful claims that this os isn't for desktops, don't believe half of what you've heard and I definitely recommend giving this os a try
For those people who claim this is just for tablets and using social networks, you don't know how wrong you are and obviously haven't taken the time to learn the os.You might also take a look at who the people are who are posting one- and two-star comments here


The overwhelming majority didn't buy this product from Amazon, if they bought it at all anywhere.

I did not have any &#34;smell&#34; issues that read about on other reviews prior to buying.  Neither does it feel weird (fake leather, suede or whatever others also stated).  Slightly stiff to put in the angled position but, that is due to it being brand new.  No issues with not being able to touch the outer regions of the screen either.  Really pleased so far!

$review_text.: OK, I had a Netgear dual brand wireless adapter that died on me after four months of light use.  I have had problems with Netgear products in the past, too.  But where I live, there is a limited selection...and I'd wanted something fast.  So I was using the Netgear for a while until it died.  To replace it, I wanted something decent and cheap.I decided to buy two adapters to replace the Netgear...a primary and a backup.  I bought a D-Link brand because I've had good luck with that brand in the past.  But I also wanted something cheap to use as a primary adapter.  Planning to use the D-Link as a really high quality backup.One of the best of the cheap adapters I could find was this one made by ianker, the uspeed wireless dual band adapter.  AFTER I ordered it, I read some reviews where it would not work at 5GHz.  That worried me, as I intended to use it at 5GHz.OK, I've got good news and bad news.  This thing is fast and reliable at both 2.4GHz and 5GHz N bands.  I initially used the latest drivers downloaded straight from the ianker web site.  I had no problem at all connecting to my Vizio brand dual-band router.  At 2.4GHz and at 5GHz.  But I wouldn't say there were not any problems.  See, to adjust my router I use a program called inssider.  To inssider, this adapter would not work.  At all.I had a feeling it was a driver issue.  This adapter uses a realtek chipset, RTL8192DU-VCSo I downloaded the driver for the chipset straight from the realtek web site.  NOW the adapter works exactly as it SHOULD work.This thing connects quickly and reliably, and with fast data throughput...to my 5GHz Vizio brand router.  Unfortunately, I can only give it 3 stars rating, due to the driver issue.EDIT:  I actually received a telephone call from the manufacturer, ianker.  They wanted more information on the driver issue.  They told me that their Product Manager was working on the driver issue.  That is awesome.  I'm still using the Realtek drivers for now.  But will probably try the ianker drivers later, to see if they have improved.  The company obviously stands behind their product, so I've bumped up my rating for that.  4 stars now.  :)

$REVIEW.: This bag is awesome

 I had absolutely no problems out of the package


 Adjusting the straps was very easy and it was on and fitting perfectly in less than 5 minutes

 The placement of the storage compartments are well configured as I can store everything I need for my camera
 I pack along my full cleaning kit, extra batteries, battery charger, and even the cable for transferring pictures to my computer all in the smallest outside compartment.On the inside main storage area there are two baffle dividers that are Velcro so you can adjust the space to fit pretty much any size camera
 I think it's weird that other reviewers question the size of this for some cameras
 Unless you are a professional with a massive telephoto lens, you can make it work by simply adjusting the panels
 I store my Nikon DSLR with two separate lenses inside this area and I adjusted the panels so that it is nice and snug inside so they don't bang around against each other while walking or hiking.I use the very top storage compartment for lunch items, and two 16.9 oz plastic water bottles
 Everything fits!The very best thing about this bag is that because it fits across my back, all I need to do is swing the bag around under my right arm and it rests horizontally across my stomach without taking it off


 Just like a guitar strapped over your neck and shoulder

 This puts the main compartment door directly on top and I can open it up and pull out the camera using the bag as a sort of table strapped around me

 I made sure it was very secure and tight so that it won't slip causing me to drop my camera or lens while I use it to hold everything while I change out the lens
It also works great as a platform to rest my elbows on for stability while taking pictures


 Oh, I would highly recommend if you use it like I do this way, that you purchase a nice wrist strap so that you don't have to fight with a long tangled neck strap when you just want to snap a quick picture right out of the bag
 I now feel like a gunslinger in an old western throwing the bag around my side and pulling out the camera in a fluid maneuver.Like I said, it is the perfect bag for me, and the only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of five is the fact that it may not work for everyone


 I am a man, so the strap going across my chest while the bag is on my back doesn't bother me a bit
 However, for a woman who may have more real estate up front, it may be a bit cumbersome


 So I guess you would have to determine if you were wearing something (that is meant to be snug) with a 2 inch strap that runs diagonally from your left shoulder to your lower right rib cage, whether this bag would work for you or not.

One thing I do not like about it at all is that the leather is very slippery.Not in a greasy or oily way but in a too smooth way even though the surface has a nubby or grainy finish
 It slides all over the place.Rest it on your knee and it slides, on a pillow it's the same and even in your open hand(s
 Put it on the armrest of a chair or couch and it slides.Get what I mean?If I were to do it all over again I'd buy a well made cloth cover.

$REVIEW.: After a couple of tries I finally (I think) figured out the user interface with this hard drive.  Would have been nice for them to include a little documentation for those of us who've never used one of these.  Haven't had to recover anything I've saved so not sure if it worked or not.  Thought I could open it on the computer and see my files, didnt realize it doesn't work that way.  Anyone want to tell me how I know it saved everything?UPDATED 2-16-10:  Used several times to transfer data from older, dying laptops to new laptop.  Only real problem I've noticed so far is the slowness on loading data from old laptops but I'm pretty sure it is due to the laptop, not the external drive.  Documents transfer off of it quite easily to new laptop.  I even figured out how to have different storage folders on the external so I can distinguish data from different machines.  The only thing I dont like is that it automatically tries to start backing up and I have to stop it to make sure it's set to the correct folders.  Not a big deal, just something to be careful with.  So far I have not experienced any of the clicks of death some have and the product is working as advertised.

The stock cd player needs to be selected to CD1 as it sees this device like a CD changer. Recommend getting special non marring tools to remove interior panels for install. These tools run less than $10 per set at Harbor Freight or can be bought here on Amazon for a good price. You can find Youtube videos for removing the radio. You may want to have a dremmel tool handy to cut a hole in the compartment under the climate controls so you have a place to run the plug for the IPOD/aux jack into. Much cheaper than buying an aftermarket radio just to use an IPOD.

It has a ton of extras for the feature freaks but if you want simplicity then just ignore all of that and shoot away.The software that comes with it is redundant if you have Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0, my personal favorite for photohandling and Photoshop Premier Elements 4.0 for movies.The movies it takes are really impressive for such a little package. It's kept me from lugging the video camera on more than one occasion.You'll want to buy another memory card. The one that comes with it won't last you long if you use the high-res setting or shoot any movies. Just make sure you spring for the FAST card, 133x or better, and you won't be sorry. The good news is that the prices of these cards seem to be dropping by the hour.All-in-all, a great camera. Until they replace it with the latest and greatest version that is....

$review_text.: So far I have only tested with one of the line outs but I will be testing the other soon with additional headphones and cords.  Quality is outstanding, I compared several headphones on output 1 and compared with a Polk Surround Bar, even modest over the ear headphones sound as good or even better then the 300$ Soundbar.  I feel the quality of the amp is more then adequate as the audio sounded rich and clean to my ears.  Obviously headphone quality varies dramatically and I tested with the Sony MDR ZX300 my old ISymphony Noise Cancelling and the Seinhesier HD 201.  The change in headphones was very interesting to pick up the small differences in the similarly priced headphones.  I thought the bass response on the Sonys was nice but I like headphones that fully enclose the ears to block out noise, amazingly scenes with thunder and base were very good, better then the subwoofer was producing.  Surprisingly the Sonys were not bad for the price still I expected a little more based on the reviews I read.  To get much better performance you need to likely spend at least 70$ and I would love to test the Sony 7506's at some point in the future.Back to the Amp, it serves its purpose well, volume only needs to be at 1/3 for the Sony headphones to be loud, plenty of power for all the Cans I tried.  Looks nice and volume controls work well being on top.  You will likely need 1/4 adapters as this unit takes full size plugs.  Really no complaints for the price, I needed an amp to go from my Digital to analogue converter so I could get audio of my TV on headphones, this way the kids can sleep and I can use my new Plasma to watch some movies at night.  For now I'm outputting from my Sony Bluray player which has a Coax digital out while I wait for my optical dual output adapter to arrive.  Once that's in I will be able to have audio on the sound bar and headphones at the same time from all inputs to the TV.  Figured it was better to go dual output then use a Toslink switch.  Its surprising to me that some TV's now only have a single digital optical output.Anyways to sum up, for 17 bucks you get an amp that powers four sets of headphones from a single 1/4 stereo jack source, just make sure to buy some adapters and long cords or hook up your wireless headphones and you should be all set.  I imagine this unit would also work well for labs and you could also further split with y adapters, I did this briefly so I could compare two headphones side by side, you will need to obviously crank the volume up though if your driving two sets of headphones from a single jack.  I imagine ear buds would need very little juice to power, mine were all over and on the ear sets and had plenty of power from the amp.

$REVIEW.: Bought this as a replacement for a slightly tired Canon Ixus which we've had for five years or so. The A2200 is substantially cheaper than the Ixus was but it shows, it's all a bit plasticky. Seems to work OK though, in that it takes decent photos, so what do you want for $110 or whatever it was. It does seem to take a while to be ready for the next shot, maybe that's because it's writing to the card and I have a slow card? I just bought a Nikon Coolpix S3100 as well which is similar spec, slightly cheaper, and feels a bit more solidly built while being smaller, so we'll see how that works out.

$REVIEW.: Delivered and installed with no problems. More than doubles the unplugged time on my son's Aspire One netbook. Another greatthing is that it has two little footrests with rubber pads for the rear part of the computer, replacing the ones that werelost long ago. The battery pack also lifts the unit up a little in the rear for better keyboard access and more airflow. Welldesigned product.
$SUMMARY.: Worth the money

$REVIEW.: Very cool unit with lots of potential
 However Pioneer really just dropped the ball on some major things.If you plan to use the USB feature, just pretend it doesn't exist


 It is so heavily riddled with bugs that you pretty much can't use it at all

 It rarely ever detects your USB stick


 And if it does, it takes a loooooong time for it to load it

 As in multiple minutes
 It's not a defective unit either or an incompatible USB stick
 Check out the website forum at AVIC411 and you'll realize that it's like this for everyone


 I haven't tested SD cards, but it seems that SD cards are the same way


 iPods I think work more reliably but I haven't tested it out

 The interface for the USB/SD cards is pathetic too; like the first generation of MP3 players

 Very limited.Also, Sirius is poorly implemented
 You only get one line of text at a time


 And you have to choose one thing for it to display


 Either station name, or artist, or song...but it can't show them all


 You have to choose


 If you want to see the others you have to tap the buttons to you get to the one you want


 Very annoying
 No station icons either
 Also the Presets won't save the station name...it'll just say "Preset 1" or "Preset 2"..

 Supposedly XM is better with the unit, but I haven't tested it


 One other thing


 People complain that the sound quality of Sirius on the unit isn't great
 I never had Sirius before so I can't compare, but I will say that it's not CD or MP3 quality
 It is a step up in sound quality compared to FM, but not by too much.FM doesn't display the artist/song name like I've seen in other units, but that could just be a limitation of my vehicle?Having said that, there are positives

 Number one...it is a cool unit
 It's literally like having a PC in your car
 The navigation works great and your location is very accurate


 MSN Direct is also cool, but know that MSN Direct is going away in Jan 2012
 Watching DVD movies is also cool.Pretty much if you plan to use the iPod connectivity and the XM connectivity (rather than USB/SD and Sirius), then the unit is awesome and you'll love it
 Otherwise only get it if you're getting a sweet deal.

$review_text.: This is actually the second keyboard dock I purchased, the first one would not charge the battery when connected. This one is pretty much flawless, the trackpad works with no issues and executes Windows 8 gestures easily, with left and right click buttons working as expected and responds to taps just fine. Typing is fine with no stuck keys and the typing feels good, with the keys having good travel and are nice and quiet when typing.Overall I have no complaints and am very happy with the keyboard dock, highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: Id have to go with the crowd on this one, pretty disappointed with this item


 While I wouldn't give it 1 star, (it did show up, description matches item, it is anti glare, and it didnt like catch on fire or blow up or anything), but it is deficient in several areas

 I really liked the Marware case, which is why I had high expectations for this item as well

 The applicator helped get most of the bubbles out from under the protector, but mine still lifts around the very edges

This leaves me the feeling I'll go through the 2 screens rather quickly as they'll lift and peel, allowing dirt and dust to comb between the screen and the protector
The cleaning cloth provided is probably insufficient to get the screen as clean as it should be before application

 Id recommend getting a good screen cleaner and wiping down with that first (if you have a lot of screens,I highly recommend the Bryson Screen Cleaner, 16 oz


Spray Bottle also sold on Amazon)


 The anti-glare film on the screen protector is very pro-smudge
 Before I was done getting all the air pockets out, using a combination of the applicator and my finger tips, the entire thing was a swirly smudgy mess

 The occurrence of smudges continues on from here as evidenced with daily usage


 I found it was this pro-smudge effect of the anti-glare screen that made the text hard to read
 Live and learn I guess


I think others have recommended the clear version of this item
 Id definitely look at something else


Wish half star ratings were available, Id give it 2.5 stars.

$review_text.: I haven't heard Beats by Dre and I'm not interested in spending $200 for any pair of headphones, but these Sony MDRZX300 are banging. If you're like me, who ride NYC Transit and get on the train the same time as teenagers getting out from school, there are just some things you're not interested in listening to. These headphones helps me to zone out the senseless garbage I hear on the train and helps me to zone into what I want to listen to - my music.Along with these I purchased the KOSS volume control adapter to adjust the volume without continuously taking my Samsung G3 out of my pocket which can get a bit annoying after a while.I've had these about a week now and I'm extremely pleased. The bass is awesome on these. Way better than the last Sony headphones I had.(I will update this review if I run into any issues).

$review_text.: I bought this during Christmas for my parents room television. I saw the weight limit, and concluded this should be more than enough to hold it up. All the parts were really sturdy, nothing was bendable and everything felt of good material. We found the wall studs and drilled a hole where the massive screws would go, these screws mean business! We used 4 of the 6 it came with and the wall mount is SOLID! This seems like it could definitely support the claimed weight limit. Setup the TV at a nice standing level with tilt and looks awesome.The only thing is the mount (like most, I would assume) does stick out a bit. Not really a con, more like a note since it will be up and out of the way regardless.

This case just snaps around my ipad2 and then has a neoprene like strap attached to it. The strap lays perfectly flat when not in use. As an added bonus the edges are rubberized so it becomes more slip resistant. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that it makes adjusting the volume a little tough, though not impossible.PROS:fits snug and securehandtstrap is tight and durablerubbberized for good gripprotects ipadCONS:hard to adjust volumenot available in fun colors

$review_text.: I got this card for my Canon 60D. It works great.I also tried an Extreme Pro 95MB/s card in my 60D and there was no measurable difference in the number of burst shots before the camera's buffer filled up, in the time it took to write the buffer to the card (when the red light stopped flashing), or in the time it took to copy images from the card to my mid-2011 iMac using its built-in card reader. With both cards, my camera can write a burst of 13 Raw (18 Megapixel) images to the card in about 20 seconds.If you are not sure what speed card to buy, go to SanDisk's web site. They have a calculator which shows which speed cards they recommend for your particular camera or other device. In my case they (correctly) recommend this Extreme 45MB/s card for my 60D. It appears that only the newest (i.e. Nikon D3200/5200) or most expensive (i.e. Canon 5D Mk III) cameras can take advantage of the faster Extreme Pro cards. If you are fortunate enough to have one of those cameras, go for the Extreme Pro. Also, If you have a USB-3 card reader, then you might see faster read times with the Extreme Pro even if your camera can't take advantage of the faster write speed.In all other cases, go for the 45MB/s Extreme, and you will be very happy with the results.It is obviously too soon to know how reliable this card will be. However, I have used several SanDisk cards in all of my digital camera's since 2004, and I have never had one fail.

$review_text.: Well, as near as :I can tell this is a good surge protector.  It also protects against lightening, and has a faulty wiring detector.  You may not think a faulty wiring detector is useful, but I had this feature on a really expensive one I bought and lost a few years ago.  I found the original builder of the house wired a couple of outlets wrong and the ground wasn't working.  Without ground on the outlet you have no protection.  I'm impressed with this APC unit so far, although the wall plug could have used a swivel.  The cord comes out at a funny angle which is only good if it points to the direction of the unit.  It is a flat plug which is nice.  In the end, we really won't know how it does until we get zapped by lightening. By the way, the 2525J is really the P8VT3 which is listed on amazon for more money.  There is no such thing as a 2525J if you look on the APC website, so buy this one, not the one listed as a P8VT3 for more money.  It is the EXACT same unit.

$review_text.: the remote looks great, although ive only use the remote for a while, it feels good in the hand, though the missing raised buttons is a lil weird, its worth it.  For those who mention being able to turn of the auto on feature, it is for another model the upgraded version of this one which is 9960b01, which is the version i have, it also allows for some other small editing features. the under of the remote has a great, almost velvet feel.I had thought the remote would be very complicated to set up, but it seriously took a matter of a few minutes to set up my tv and dvd player, though the code for my dvd player didnt work for it, the learning function copied my remote in everyway, INCREDIBLE feature fun and very easy to do. as for the batterie usage, i havent needed to replace them just yet, but i am using energizer E3 which are lithium and last much longer than other batteries, espcially with high drainage items such as this one.I am very happy with this remote and greatly recommend it to everyone.

$review_text.: Just set these up around the pool. Technically all went well, sound is fair for the price.Problem 1), and if you have a solution, please let me know: They seem to connect only to the headphone jack of my receiver (Denon AVR1611), so when i plug them in, my receiver turns off the main speakers. Called Denon, and the operator either didn't know much or just couldn't help.Problem 2) I would like to plug them into my 6 and 7 speaker connectors in my Denon. I already have 2 outdoor speakers connected to those terminals (my main Zone is set as 5.1). I would like to connect/piggyback the Mutant Media Blocks (MMB) to those same speaker terminals, but don't know what kind of wiring adapter i need. Essentially, I would be going from 2 red/black terminals to 2 RCA jacks (that is 4 to 2). In addition, since these are "amped" speaker terminals, will it affect (blow up) my MMB wireless transmitter?Thank you all for your help.BTW, if you are looking for buying advice and you don't mind using up your headphone jack for these wireless speakers, go ahead. Fair price for the item.Any enlightenment would be appreciated.Email: LDykler@forefront.caFollow up, Oct 27/2010.Have been in contact with "support". They told me to forget connecting the transmitter to the speaker terminals, might damage the transmitter. Again, if anyone did this or knows if it would work, i would appreciate the info.Part of the marketing literature says "Perfect for some quiet background music for yourself, or playing music for a large party". Well, forget a party of any kind. Since you can only connect these to the headphone jack of the receiver, all receivers will automatically turn off all speakers as soon as you plug anything to the hp jack.

Not only is it whisper quiet (and I mean your boss will think you're not working from the lack of keyboard clacking), but extremely responsive. Whether it's the cordless or the corded Elite, Logitech got it right with just the right amount of buttons, all of which are placed within easy reach of your typing position. And if you can't tell from the picture shown by Amazon, it's also one heck of a smooth looking technology, and at a great price. The system preference software (this refers to the Mac OS X version) is a delight to use, and you can reassign just about any function key or navigation/internet key to anything you like. Want the CD-ROM eject key assigned to function key 4? No problem. Wanna raise or lower your computer's volume quickly? The ribbed wheel is right there at your disposal. It even has multimedia keys for most of the music software out there on the market, like iTunes and DVD player (stop, forward, back, pause).Can I say anything else? Yes. The price is phenomenal compared with what Microsoft wants for an ugly beige keyboard that basically offers the same thing (Mac users need not apply). This is one keyboard that won't disappoint.

$review_text.: I purchased this item hoping to get the 3.1 update ASAP, but it appears that I have to wait.  I called Logitech support and without much time on hold, the tech in India told me that the "roll out" for the 3.1 will be completed by the end of the week.  We'll see..What do I use the Revue for?  To have all my movies, Amazon videos, G4TV, Netflix, music, sat TV  and pics within easy reach.  Before I had several remotes and HDMIs to switch to watch a program.  Now it is pretty simple, and the setup was easy too.The worse part about the Revue is the supported video formats that 2.1 firmware offers.  I have a WDTV that can handle almost any type of video file I throw at it.  This Revue is playing about 75% of the files.  The 2.1 does not support MKV w DTS.  In the forums I have read that users with the 3.1 have had no problems.Another current con is the lack of apps.  I know that the 2.1 does not really support apps as in an app store, but the 3.1 update will fix that too.  Currently the big let down is the amazon app that came with the 2.1 version.  It totally stinks and my videos on Amazon are completely unusable.  I hope this is fixed in 3.1.The coolist thing that the Revue can do it the free Logitech Harmony for Apple and Android devices.  No more hunting for a remote, just pull out your cell phone and work the TV.gtv is trying toWhy only the 3 stars?  in the 2.1 firmware the unit leaves alot to be desired.  I will wait for the 3.1 update and then update my review as needed.To those thinking about purchasing a Revue, think about what you need it for.  It is not a cable box killer =... although that time is close at hand.If you have lots of videos, pictures and music; would like to combine your cable, this maybe the right product.  Hopefully the 3.1 will provide access to content providers like Revision and CNET like the RUKU player does.  For 99.99 you really can't go wrong.  AVCHD will not work, MKV with DTS will have no sound.  Bummer, you can convert the MKV DTS to AC3 and place the AC3 in the MKV container and remove the DTS.  Kinda time comsuming but it can be done.  Also, about 20% of my AVI file will not work with the 2.1 software.  Not to sure why that is.FThis review of the Revue was writen while on the Revue with the Revue keyboard.Update 12/10/11:Just got the 3.1 update.  Pretty nice.  There is an app store you can get to now,but most of the apps are not very good.  Hopefully things will change in the future as Google Tv catches on (it is on life support now).AVI support is now complete as far as O can tell, I have tries several of my AVIs and all have played fine.  I have 500+ AVI files and  am not going to try ythem all for this review.Search intergration.  One thing that GTV is lacking is the search function.  You can hit the search key and look for content on the internet... sorta.  If you search for a movie that is on YouTube or Netflix you are OK, but if it is on Amazon, In your Amazon account or a video file on the Revue media player, you will not see that file.  There is a neat search function within the Revue media player tat will search local content, but a complete search would be really nice.Conclusion:If you are looking for a player that you can throw any type of video file at it and it will play, the WDTV for about the same price is what you are looking for.  If you are looking for something that makes access to your content and external content (mainly movies and TV shows that you can find on Neflix and such), and you know a little about how to transcode if needed, connected it all with your set top box, and have ease of function.  You have found the item.For less than a hundred dollar bill, this is a wonderful device.  for the three hundred that early users paid, they got ripped off.Since Amazon states that this GTV will stream their videos, I hope amazon will make an application , like they have for the Roku player that will make looking at Amazon content a lot easier.  I am sure that  it is coming.Update...No Amazon VOD update/fix no Netflix update/fix no android 3.2.  Android Market still almost no apps, and those that it does have stink.Save your money, get something else!

$review_text.: Can be programmed manually, programming with a PC is also possible but very very kludgy, unless of course you have Visa and and working knowledge of Korean.
$SUMMARY.: Good value device, somewhat opaque to programming.

$review_text.: I use this Speed and Cadence sensor on my Trek Bike to track both the speed of my back wheel and the cadence of my peddling.  Combined with a Garmin head unit, or with a virtual trainer like TrainerRoad.com, this unit can be used to calculate virtual power throughout a workout.  This device has been essential in my workouts over the past year.
$SUMMARY.: Great Speed and Cadence sensor

$REVIEW.: I'm very happy with the quality, sturdiness, and compactness of this tripod.  The weight is a bit more than I would like, but didn't want to spend more than $200 for the carbon fiber model to save 0.5 lb.  The price is a bit high, but there really is no alternative at this price range.I took off one star because the quick-release plate must be attached to the camera with an allen wrench or screwdriver.  This is very inconvenient.
$review_summary.: Great tripod, questionable QR plate

$REVIEW.: I have seen many negative reviews for this product. Which surprises me. I have been using this product for awhile now, I like the look of them. More importantly is the sound, for me it is perfect. I like the fact that it feels like I am listening to music being performed just for me. I have found the right size earbud with the options given to me, they do not fall out. I will admit fitting it into my iphone five it looks a bit weaird but that is from my protective case.  I like loud music with many different instuments, I am able to discern the complexities of the instruments with these earbuds. In truth I will be buying another pair as I am of the thought you like something get it while you can, it has taken many trials and errors before finding these.  But to each there own you will not know unless you try them yourself.
$SUMMARY.: Will be buying more

$review_text.: Really pleased with this HDMI cable
 15 feet is the perfect length for in doing classroom work as well as at home when connecting my computer to a tv or projector.This cord comes nicely wound in a small cardboard box that is quite sturdy and can be used as a transport device for the cord if needed


 The quality of this cord is really good, i have one other in the 3 foot length and they both work flawlessly
 Highly recommended,


$SUMMARY.: Nice inexpensive HDMI

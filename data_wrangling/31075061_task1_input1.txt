$REVIEW.: Well, as cases go, this one looks good on the tablet. It feels like you're carrying a day planner. It adds some weight, but that is not itself a bad thing. Some tablets are too thin and light, making them amazingly easy to drop. The problem with this case is the keyboard. The rubber keys must be pushed rather hard for them to register, making fluid typing nearly impossible.Save yourself the hassle. Buy another case!

$review_text.: I've been using these APP or Anderson Power Pole connectors for years and they are very reliable.  They have a couple of different sizes available, but this means that the spade is made to fit a different wire size.  The standard connectors are interchangeable as long as you stay away from the 75 amp size which is about 4 times larger.The Mfg suggests you use a crimp tool for the best connection.  I prefer to solder mine but you really have to be careful if you desire to solder yours.  DO NOT bend or reshape the top of the connector or you can have issues with your connection.  I had a clamp I was using when soldering these and it turned out that I was tightening it too much and bending the spade and thus giving myself issues when I used them, the connections were too loose!  I was able to rebend everything and fix it, but be wise and avoid that kind of problem.The pros for these connectors are that they are fairly easy to connect and disconnect.  Unlike Deans, you can disconnect them by pulling on the housing and not on the wire.  The Deans connectors are so small it's hard to hold onto just the case and I usually end up putting at least some pressure on the wire.The biggest pro for using these in your HAM shack is that everyone else is using them too and you can interchange equipment as necessary.  One key to this is that you MUST orient them correctly for things to remain interchangable.  To know you have them the same as the general HAM community, when looking at the end with the small A stamped on it, with the A oriented up-right, the red is on the right and the black is on the left and the spades are on the top facing down.  I'll have to get a picture posted as this is key to your ability to interconnect these.  If you orient yours this way, you can also use other ham equipment that is purchased with these connectors already istalled.Having the little pin does keep them together a little better but a drop of CA takes care of the problem just fine.  The only issue with CA is that it's NOT something you can undo, where the pins are removable.4 stars for a great product, but not 5 because the spades are soft and you have to be careful as you assemble these or they are difficult to use.  Too bad they can't be like Deans where the spade part is not affected by the solder work.
$review_summary.: Reliable connector, considered standard in Ham radio clubs and RC uses above 30 amps

The recorder comes with a USB cord that connects it to my Mac


All I have to do is download the mp3 file onto my hard drive, dismount the recorder, and I'm ready to transcribe my notes.The recorder is very easy to use, out of the box


I didn't have to refer to the instructions in order to learn the basic features

$REVIEW.: I just built a ITX machine and the board had a maximum memory speed of 1333 MHz and contained two memory slots. The motherboard had on-board  CPU/GPU. I installed the MB, RAM, and assembled the case with a 500 GB Western Digital HD. I plugged in an external DVD and put a Windows 8 system builder in the drive. Finally I set a cross over cable up to my main PC and set up internet sharing to the LAN Port from my wireless,( a second ad-hoc that gave the build internet connectivity.) I slapped in a new Windows 8 system builder DVD and put in the key and went to dinner. When I came back the system was installed and ready for me to set up an account to use the Windows store. Every driver was installed 100% through the internet or Windows 8 disk! One thing for those that are new to Windows 8, right click the little Metro Screen that pops up where the Start Button used to be, (lower left hand corner) to get to the Control Panel.

It works even better than I had hoped as far as passing the HDMI signal straihgt to the TV speakers when the receiver is not turned on, a feature that works great if you have someone who also uses the TV, video, Wii etc and don't ever learn how to make things work. In this case, my wife did not even know we had a receiver. I have not used the amplifier in this receiver, just a old 5 channel amp connected to the pre-outs. It has surpassed my expectations.

$REVIEW.: Ok, so I bought this maybe 5 or so months ago

Two ports on it didn't work out of the box


No biggie, it was cheap and I only needed two ports, not worth returning it over.I did get five months of use out of it but now only one port works (at which point, um, what's the point? Just use the original USB port on my computer and be able to power the device through it too).Anyways, it works about as well as you'd expect something this cheap to work (you get what you pay for)


Though I don't think I paid for what it's asking price now is

I'd say it's worth a few dollars but 6 bux seems a bit high for it
Gave it two stars mainly cause at least you aren't overpaying for the bad quality


But yeah, don't expect much.This time though I think I'll pay a little more and hopefully get something that works longer and works as advertised.

$REVIEW.: Buttery soft leather fits snuggly on my EX-Z1000
I only wish the sides of the carrying case were at least a half inch or taller to offer it more stability in case the magnetic snap is unintentionally opened
No accidents yet, even when carried on my belt - but ever since I once cracked the screen on a cell phone, I've been extra cautious with this camera from the beginning.If you plan on carrying an extra SD card or two in the space provided for business cards, then they will have to be without their protective case
 I use expensive high end cards, and I'm not willing to take that risk

 So, for longer outings, I'm going to stick with my TAMRAC 5204 with a Velcro closer and roomier pocket for my cased SD cards.Ah, but at restaurants and birthday parties I will be packing it in my Exlim case, because it is as breathtaking as the camera it protects.I recommend this case for people that take care of their equipment


 It offers moderate protection against damage and excellent protection from scratches


 It even fits my Gorillapod Mounted camera, which is very, very important for tripod users.

$review_text.: - Just installed this antenna.. Excellent quality, easy to assemble.  This went on a roof tripod which yields about 25 -30 ft above ground level.. Pulling in VHF hi and UHF tv stations from 80 - 90 miles away.. No amplifier needed..  Have at least 75 ft of RG6 cable.. Only one tv hooked up..  All stations crystal clear.  All our tv antennas are located in the same general direction..  No obstructions to that direction, rural residence..  For the cost of these antennas, how do you go wrong?  This worked good as we had an existing tripod on roof with a 10 ft pipe.. This antenna mounts in the center of antenna, so if you need something to go like on a side of house on a Dish mount, then this antenna will probably not work well..  There are many other that mount to the back of antenna, making more installation options...  These antenna exceeded my expectations in regards to what it was rated for and the performance it achieves..

$REVIEW.: I'm enjoying my GiiNii GH-8DNP so far.  From unboxing to viewing pictures took less than 10 minutes.In the box is the frame, two different mats, the screen, manual, glass, and a power cable.  Having two mats included was a nice touch.  The first mat is all white, while the second is white with a brown trim.  Putting all the pieces together was easy.  The mat did not need to be adjusted.The technical set up is very easy.  An interface guides you through the first couple steps - such as setting up the date and time.  Then, you can begin to view your pictures.  The slide show has several options for display time and transitioning between pictures.  I just popped a card in from a recent vacation and set the pictures to be on the screen for 1 minute at a time.I find myself just staring at this picture frame.  The colors are beautiful.  I especially like the way the frame handles green and red.One feature I wish this frame had is the ability to stream images from a computer.Overall, I like this frame a lot.  It's my first digital picture frame and it's a lot of fun to just watch.

$review_text.: I read a few reviews on here and the one major problem that scared me was the speaker volume issue.  Then I read a cnet review (done by professionals) and they said it was clear and loud.  Well, I ordered one and I can hear the lady speak while I am driving on the highway, have my music on (not really loud, level 8) and have my defroster going (it is cold now).  I can still hear her just fine with all that noise.Pros:-Interface easy to use and quick (mapped 440 mile trip in about 12-15 seconds and was the route i usually take)-Re-route quick (if you go off your route)-Window mount sturdy.  Wish it could swivel b/c my unit sits slanted due to my windshield.-Slick looking device-Fast satellite acquisitionCons:-If you drive off route it won't tell you the next turn until you are at least .1 miles from it.  I find that is about average but have had some Garmin devices say "recalculating route" follwed by "turn at xxx in xxx."Biggest Con:-Have to hold power button down for 16 seconds for unit to turn on and 8 seconds to hard off.  What Navigon does not put in the user manual (nor did tech support know) was there is a standby mode.  It should take 6 seconds to go on (mine is 16 no clue why) and then if you simply click the power button the screen goes off.  That is some form of stand by mode.  The next time you press the power button the unit comes back to life fast.  To hard power off hold power button for 8 seconds and it goes  completely off.  I would love to see if anyone else has this issue.I wouldn't put this as a con, you do have to tap the screen for more than a hot millisecond for it to register.  Some people said they were having troubles.  Well if you press really lightly really fast it wont register.  If you press hard and fast, it will.  I think some people are just being too light with their touch.That cnet review I mentioned above said their unit took 10 minutes to find a satellite signal.  From hard power off mine takes about 1 minute or less.  From soft power standby it takes maybe 20-30 seconds if that.If I remember I will come back after a month and post up my continued review.  Right now I am very happy with the device.

$review_text.: The featureset of this unit is pretty good but it has nothing more really than the standard CD bedside radio these days. The iPod dock is a nice feature but again, it's not unusual enough to receive a higher than average score. If you are going to use this unit as a bedside alarm clock, be warned! The battery backup keeps only the audio and FM radio presets... when the power goes, the clock resets IMMEDIATELY and your alarms are silenced. There is no battery backup for the clock!!Your perception of the sound quality depends on your reference point and the type of music you play. If you compare it to your average clock radio, the sound quality is AMAZING! If you compare it to even a modest home theater setup, the bass and the overall dynamic range is underwhelming. As such, I'd suggest this unit for background listening only; critical listeners need not apply! Overall however, the sound is very balanced. It sounds best when you are sitting *directly* in front of it. The strength of high-frequencies drop off noticeably once you sit at an angle so for the best listening experience, set it up where you will be directly in front. The number 1 recommendation I could give for this unit is do not buy it either (a) before you listen to it yourself or (b) you can return it easily with no penalty. Depending on your expectations, you could be disappointed.BTW, please check the dimensions of your bedside table before you buy this unit.. it's pretty big!

$review_text.: I'm not a computer geek so please forgive the lack of technical information in this review


 So far everything seems to be great, it starts fairly fast and does what I ask it to do
 I'll admit that the number pad crimps up space for the keyboard a bit and I do seem to make a few spelling errors but nothing serious


 As far as the touchpad, I really haven't noticed having any problems with it, my wrists don't rest on it when typing and I usually use a mouse anyway so I have better control

 I had a previous Toshiba which I gave to my mother and she's still using it even though I bought it several years ago on sale at Walmart so I have high hopes that I will be using this one for awhile (can't afford to upgrade every time something new comes along)
 There might be better computers out there and certainly newer ones but I'm happy with this one.

$review_text.: [Redacted]Edit:After close to a year of ownership the screen randomly took on a single dead pixel. I set it down for the night and two days later I opened it to see about a hundred dead pixels across the screen. I sent it in for warranty repair where it sat for two weeks with no status update. Finally after a phone call I was told it was "customer induced damage" and would not be covered. Please note, there was no customer induced damage the worst damage the computer had was a smudged screen from fingerprints.I am a former Asus employee at their Jeffersonville repair facility where I worked on this exact laptop among others for refurbish support (most of what that facility does is component support). This wasn't customer induced damage this was "we don't want to fix it because it's too hard and expensive so we'll blame the customer."Asus is dead to me now.

 (Rim attached to the camera broke, data lines severed.)I don't know how well other bags can handle this situation, but this accidental drop cost me 160$.I'm going to pack lots of soft fillings in the bag from now on

 To be extra careful not to fall would be difficult and perhaps not worth the effort.Otherwise, the bag is fine


 But isn't a bag like this supposed to be protective for its content?  Maybe without the bag, the camera would have been broken with a 1000$ bill to fix, but hey, am I asking too much for a camera bag to hold up against a 2 feet drop?Le

$REVIEW.: I'd used Fuji waterproof disposables before and wasn't crazy about the results.  The prints were all green.  The miracle of Photoshop found images in the blur, so all in all . . .not too bad.  I bought this Intova reusable because, well, it's reusable.  I considered getting a waterproof digital camera but those get pricy; probably the best deal going is a waterproof Kodak video camera ($100+) but I don't know if it can be used for still photos.  I also bought a waterproof camera bag to use with my Panasonic camcorder, a little cheapie, but didn't get to try it.I just got back prints from the Intova: 21 pictures on a 27 exposure roll.  Nearly all of them green blurs.  I didn't read the package UNTIL the pix came back: the camera, which comes loaded with a roll 0f 35mm film, had a DEVELOP BY date of JUNE 2009!!  That, my friends, is three years ago.  The vendor should not sell a camera with expired film or, at least, they should say so.  After all, it isn't hard to get new film and load the darn thing. As it is, I got ZERO pictures from my underwater vacation.The camera itself seems awfully basic: fixed focus, a flash lever, a winding dial, a gunsight eyepiece.  Nothing fancy.  I wasn't expecting sophistication.  One downside I hadn't foreseen was that the camera is bulkier than a Fuji underwater disposable.  This makes it unwieldy if you swim and hold the camera at the same time.  (A plus: an adjustable wrist lanyard help you keep it with you.)What did I expect for the low price I paid?  I didn't expect film three years after its drop dead date.
$SUMMARY.: Don't buy!  Outdated film!!

$review_text.: These aren't amazing. They work pretty well for what they do though. Mine came with the 640 tv line cameras and a note saying it was a free upgrade (Amazon name said 530, box said 600, actually got 640), I assume they do this for everyone though. I ran one camera a week because my attic is a terrible place to be. Still have two more to run. So far they have been good. My main complaint is the interface. All of them. The DVR interface, mobile version, and web version. Heads up for the mobile version, you have to use the admin account and the first 6 digits of your admin password. I also had to get more cabling but I wont knock it off for that, I needed longer runs. I'm also going to spray mine with insecticide some time because spiders apparently love these things. I have to brush off webs about once a week. The night vision on them is ok but not spectacular. I bought some solar lights and a flood light that has a low setting to help with that. It's a good camera system but not what I was hoping. If you want a super high end system with 1080p video and such, expect to pay 4 times as much. If you get good lighting, this system will be perfectly fine I think. Just an extra layer of security.

$review_text.: Yes video codec support is limited, but the vast majority of my videos and movies are encoded in MP4 or M4V and this had no issues streaming them to my iPad during my last vacation.App is simple to set-up, you can password protect it so no one else has unauthorized access to it, and I got about 6.5 hours of battery life from using it.If you want to download instead of stream a video, that may take about 10-15 minutes for a movie length file (2 hours of video or so)


 Hopefully the next iteration will be slimmer with faster download and upload wireless speeds with increased video codec support.

However, unlike the western digital ones, this case is actually quite sturdy which I can compare to my Case Logic cases I use for my other hard drives.

$REVIEW.: After a year of frustration with a Philips DivX capable player, I found this Toshiba to be a gigantic improvement.My primary reasons for buying this player were DivX capability, a decent remote, and quick recognition of video file names. The Philips would not recognize many DivX and XVID files, it would sometimes take more than a minute to set up a menu for a CD or DVD of DivX-encoded files, and the remote was the most poorly designed one that I've ever come across.The previous review faulted the lack of retention of settings, especially for HDMI, and I can't argue. For me, though, it's not a problem since my primary goal is DivX playback. Its performance on computer video playback is exemplary. It sets up menus in just a few seconds. Playback of .avi files is flawless; it plays files that the Philips choked on without a bit of trouble. I've had NO problem playing back any DVD that I've tried, and it has NEVER hung up on me. [Since the review was written, I've played at least 75 disks, and it did hang up one one; however, my other player and PC did the same on this disk] The effective angle of the remote is no worse than on other DVD players that I've used, and is better than most. The remote is beautifully organized and quite comprehensive. The amount of information about computer video formats revealed by the Display button is impressive; this player can even handle Ogg Vorbis audio, which is an extreme rarity among players.On the down side, the blue light that shines around the tray is really irritating, and so is having to cut it off every time you restart the player. I don't use a flat panel display, so the HDMI settings don't matter to me, but I can see it being a problem to those who need it.For people who want DivX playback who are not bothered by the HDMI limitations or the blue light, this is an exceptional player. I'd buy this over the other DivX-capable players that I've seen without a second's hesitation. Now, if they'd only make a player capable of handling .ogm and .mkv files . . .Addendum: after a while, I noticed that while the player plays divx and other encoded DVDs perfectly, it sometimes hangs up on ordinary DVDs. It's not perfect, but it still works well considering the price and its major application.

 Weightwise, this charger would be good to use in a car, okay for throwing in a suitcase, and probably less desirable for use on a backpacking trip where every extra ounce counts.One nifty feature not always found on other chargers is an indicator light showing how much of a charge is left in the device


 You can push a button on the side and from one to four blue indicator bulbs on the top light up to let you know how much of a charge is currently stored


 Four lights mean the device is charged to capacity and one means less than a 25% capacity is remaining.

$review_text.: Purchased in February, 2009
Love the zoom, ease of use, flexibility, AA batteries and pic quality

Not happy with quality of Canon cameras these days
This had a problem with a spot on the pics that Canon repaired under warranty in March, 2010
Had a problem with a color shift in April, 2011 that Canon will not repair under warranty and quote $100 to repair


Not worth it

Two years use is pretty bad when my earlier Canon cameras lasted 5+ years.

$REVIEW.: Bought four (301256U) for work back when they were over $700 each, now they're a super bargain.  The USB and Firewire both work fine with WinXP Pro.  The drives keep cool, and they're in removable trays.  (When is somebody going to make a nice RAID box that latches in bare drives--getting tired of trays.)  We've filled these up with data, streaming 25GB per day over FW800, used them for portable storage.  Rock solid over a year now.  "User serviceable" with swappable drives.At home I went cheap and bought a Calvary.  The Calvary worked for USB but not for Firewire (saw the drive in My Computer but couldn't actually access it) on WinXP Home.  Then the Calvary died--had some kind of internal electronic failure 13 months after buying it, no warranty coverage (so the files are still present on the bare drives inside the Calvary box, I can mount the individual drives with a USB/SATA dongle to get the data off).  Will never buy another Calvary product and instead I'm shopping for a LaCie 2-big right now, deliberating between NAS and USB/Firewire for home use.

$review_text.: This is the second ArmorSuit I purchased

The first one was for my grandson's 10 inch tablet.With a little care they are the easiest to install of any I have seen before
I have a different one on my NOOKColor from Barnes & Noble
It was not as easy to install as the ArmorSuit.The only downside I see, in my opinion, is that it does not reduce screen glare
Most people are not bothered by the glare, but I like to sit outside in the summer and read
Then the screen glare does become an issue
Because I have limited mobility it's hard for me to adjust the surface of the reading device to eliminate glare.

$REVIEW.: This attractive red case is well made and it does the job of protecting your Kindle Fire HD.  It looks good, I'd go so far as to call it eye-catching.  The stitching is neat and even and it's nicely padded to absorb those inevitable knocks and jolts.  It has 4 silicone-enhanced elastic straps to hold the Kindle in place without interfering with the operating buttons and a pocket on the inside to keep notes or business cards.  In short, it's a lovely case.Now come the "buts".  There is no closure mechanism on the case.  Short of inelegantly wrapping an elastic band around it to secure it, there is no way to insure that the Verso case will remain closed while in your purse or backpack.  Next, it doesn't work well as a stand, critical when you want to read or watch audio hands-free.  I tried it a few times and it just flopped down each time.  And finally, and perhaps most importantly, those elastic straps.  While there's nothing inherently wrong with them and they do allow the case to be used for devices other than the Kindle Fire HD, they aren't the best or most secure solution.  Perhaps the fact that Lightwedge has designed the case to fit multiple devices is actually part of the problem.  Those cases which are engineered for one specific product are able to customize the fit so the tablet may slip into the case like a glove without the need for straps to hold it in.  The Amazon Kindle Fire HD Standing Leather Case (which I also own) is one of these.  The Kindle just fits tightly and securely inside its shell and stays there even when turned upside down.  The Amazon case also addresses the other issues that I have with this case.  It's not as pretty as the Verso Trends Darwin Croc but it all comes down to what you're looking for in a case, aesthetics or practicality.

$REVIEW.: Ipod multifunction battery accessory - I run some tests.As many have observed, the Macally PowerLink does what it claims to do. Its a battery extender, a computer sync cable eliminator, and a 2GB flash drive. But how well does it execute these functions?As a battery extender I have tested it with a Ipod Touch 2G.  I conditioned the PowerLink first by fully charging and discharging it 3 times. The instruction manual claims 270 mAh battery capacity. For the Touch it compares with about 850-1200 mAh built in battery capacity (as quoted by various sources, I never did see an official Apple spec). This would seem to imply at a minimum a 22% power extension (or about an hour and a half extra of video playback). For my test I used a YouTube streaming video movie with the Touch brightness set at about 50%, the WiFi was on.  When the PowerLink is connected the battery symbol on the Ipod shows charging/external power. The PowerLink has 4 LED's for showing state of charge; connected/data transfer, quarter, half and full charge. I started the test by playing the movie and when the quarter charge led wen out, I checked the Ipod battery symbol, and indeed it now showed that it was now operating on its own battery. This occurred 49 minutes after the start of the test. In conclusion you can roughly get an extra 15% of video (49 minutes) or an extra 5 hours of music. The instruction book says that it is good for extending TALK time up to one hour. (The one hour is typed on a small sticker, peeling it off shows that it used to say 25 minutes underneath.) Considering the hassle of replacing the built in battery it may make sense to use the PowerLink whenever you first play videos, the music playing time extension hardly seems worth it.As a sync cable eliminator: Well you have to use a short male to female USB plug extender cord (included) just to locate the PowerLink in a convenient spot. Since I hate to drag my official sync cable on the road, I do think I will use the PowerLink in the car where I can plug it into my cigarette USB power adapter, and use the Sync cable for charging the Touch and the PowerLink (have not tried this yet). I do wish the device would include the small lock pins to lock it into the Ipod (my 1G Nano sync cable had this, but the 2G Touch sync cable does not). It is way too easy to accidentally pull out the PowerLink from the Ipod.Finally the 2GB flash drive test. This would be a fantastic feature if the Ipod could play a music or a video file from the PowerLink. No such luck, so we are only getting the convenience of a 2GB flash drive. How good is it? Well for comparison, I  tried to transfer  2,000 files for a total of 1.81 GB. On a WinXP dual core system. The data transfer box predicted 60 minutes. Wow, the test was aborted. The PowerLink is formatted as a simple FAT file format. I went with a much less ambitious test, 29 files - 82.9 MB. Formatted as is, it took 92 seconds to transfer them to the PowerLink (95 seconds when reformatted as a FAT32 file system, so leave it as FAT). This is only .90MB/sec. For comparison I transferred the sane files to my PNY 4GB Optima Pro flash disk, it took only 13.4 seconds for a 6.19 MB/sec rate. By this test the PowerLink is a pretty slow flash disk.In conclusion the PowerLink does a lot of things, but none of them exceptionally well. On the other hand I cant think of a different device that also does these things in such a small all-in-one package. So if you got to have a battery backup with some extra features this is the one to get.

$REVIEW.: I have owned my Nikon 8700 for almost two years and have taken over 7000 photos.  It is a very good serious amateur's camera and might make a reasonable back-up for a professional phtotographer. The 8 megapixel resolution is enough for moderately sized prints, up to about 11 x 14, assuming no cropping.The zoom lens is reasonably fast and quite convenient.  Autofocus is normally pretty good, but as one approaches close-up shots with long focal length and moderate or low light, it fails quite regularly.  One can see it 'hunt' right through the perfect focus and choose something not even close.  Otherwise, the optics seem pretty good.  The viewfinder is bright, but it is really small. It will indicate whether the subject is in the frame, but it will give only a hint of what the final result will look like.  This puts it at a great disadvantage to real "through the lens" slr's.It will produce very sharp images under moderately favorable conditions.  There is  only a little barrel distortion and vignetting at short focal lengths, and virtually no chromatic aberration. The jpeg compression, comes in three flavors: basic, normal, and fine.  Basic is alright for small snapshot photos and shots of very smooth things, but it produces a lot of jpeg artifacts when trees are cast against the sky or other places where irregular edges contrast with the background. Fine mode has very little of this problem.  In-camera sharpening works reasonably well, though even the lowest level will produce banding artifacts in high contrast areas. These will typically be visible only during image editing, though.Color reproduction is generally quite good, but dark and midtone colors between blue and red - especially those between magenta and red - will often appear to be qualitatively very different in the photo from what they do to the eye.  It is something that can be repaired in Photoshop, but anyone without a really solid image-editing program will be tempted to throw the camera against the wall.  In other words - if you want this camera, you need to have an image editing program that allows adjustment of curves, and adjustment of hue and saturation for the six primary and secondary colors. My cheap Fujifilm 2800 is much more faithful with these reds.With eight different modes of operation including landscape, flowers, indoor portrait, fireworks, and panorama, the electronics offer a good variety of modes.  I use floral and landscape all the time, and they work quite well.  Floral mode offers five zones that you can use for focus and exposure metering, making this a really handy mode for all kinds of close work.Other modes are not quite as good.  I tried nightime landscape last night.  It was a full moon  - one of those 'bright as day' nights.  But the shutter did not stay open long enough to register any sort of an image, except for a ghostly dark gray image of some pure  white surfaces. Similarly, the flash manages to make everything look ugly.  This may not be a quality unique to this flash, but I would never use the flash except for cases of slight fill when the subject was 6-10 feet away. In its defense, there is a hot shoe and if I were not in the habit of using natural light for everything, I should have mastered this art by now.Most of the controls are intuitive and easy to use.  There is a bank of controls that naturally falls beneath the left hand when one is steadying the camera.  These include the jpeg adjustment, self timer, and the flash mode selector.  I have ruined many dozens of shots by accidently pressing one of these.  Almost every photo-shoot in moderate or low light finds me waiting for the self-timer. And I went a whole shoot doing "basic" mode when I intended "fine."The body is solid and it is mechanically quite sound. It fits the hands quite comfortably. Fit and finish are very soli.  After two years of moderate use, the camera seems none the worse for the wear. Even the decals are in mint condition  I have two batteries and a charger, and find that this is just barely enough. I also bought a 1 gigapixel card and would not reecommend anything less.I have owned three film SLR's and I could never recommend trading to this camera from a film SLR.  I have scanned a number of slides and am sure that this  camera produces an image, that is is better than one from a 35mm, but one quickly misses the control one is used to shooting manually with an SLR.  I bought this camera at the same time as a Pentax 6x7 medium format camera, and I find myself using this for almost everything because it is so much more convenient and portable.  And only in the case of images that would be over 20 inches on a side is the advantage of high resolution one that makes the Pentax a better choice.  For those serious about fine art landscapes and other photos with much detail, medium format film will still beat this camera or, probably any digital camera for detail.  But for less than poster-sized pictures under normal shooting conditions, it is hard to beat this camera.

$REVIEW.: So, after seeing the reviews that are mostly positive based on recent batches, and the manufacturer's commitment to standing behind their product, I decided to pull the trigger on one of these

I just couldn't bring myself to pay what Nikon wanted for a spare battery
I'm using this in a battery grip of a Nikon D7000

With the grip attached, I don't use a second battery in the camera, I just put it into the grip since it's a whole lot easier to switch out


It works perfectly

I have not noticed a single abnormality using the Wasabi battery compared to the stock Nikon battery
Battery life seems relatively comparable to me, though I've only been through 2 discharge cycles


I've run down the regular Nikon one in between for comparison--and don't really see much difference

It charges fine with the stock Nikon charger

In my opinion, it's worth it to be able to have another battery around to swap out during the course of a day shooting


At this price, I'll likely pick up another one just in case for the future

I recommend this battery for those looking to save some money.

$REVIEW.: This was my first prime lens for my E-PL2 in the native M4/3 format to get away from kit zooms.  Soon afterward bought its larger 60mm DN cousin.  I've since upgraded to an E-PL5 and this is still my most used lens.  These sigma lenses are crazy sharp with great contrast and color rendition, superior to kit and to other SLR primes I've used with a M43 adapter.  My copy even appears superior in sharpness and color rendition IMO to the more costly panny 14mm 2.5 (though I still need the latter for quality wide-angle shots).  Plan to acquire the 30mm soon to fill the gap between the 19 and the 60.

$REVIEW.: They gave it 4 out of 5 stars, rating of 8/10.The good:Solid 720p video; ultraslim design; removable, rechargeable battery; easy to use; one-touch video uploading to YouTube and Photobucket; includes mini HDMI connector and bundled cable for outputting 1080i video to an HDTV.The bad:No flash-memory slot; Mac users have to manually copy video files to their computers; white balance is slightly off and colors are a little amped.The bottom line:The Creative Vado HD may fall slightly short of the Flip Video Mino HD in terms of video quality, but it's stronger feature set may tempt you.Things are heating up in the mini camcorder space as Kodak, RCA, Flip Video, and now Creative all have HD models. Flip Video leads the market with its popular Mino HD camcorder, but Creative has done some interesting things with its Vado HD to make your choice that much harder.For starters, the Vado HD retains many of the appealing design traits of the original Vado, including an ample 2-inch antiglare LCD (for recording and playback)with some small modifications. The Vado HD comes in black and its lens extends out from the body instead of being slightly recessed. The new model is a hair thicker and weighs slightly more (3.5 ounces vs. 3.3 ounces), and the mic has been shifted to the other side of the lens. More importantly, however, the Vado has something that neither the Kodak Zi6 nor the Flip Video MinoHD has: a mini HDMI connector for outputting 1080i video to your HDTV along with a standard composite AV output. Surprisingly, Creative also bundles an HDMI cable, though not a composite cable. Plus, it comes with 8GB of built-in memory vs. the MinoHD's 4GB. That allows you to store 2 hours worth of HD video.In our review of the Vado, we knocked it a bit for its no-frills implementation, and Creative seems to have taken that to heart. Along with the HDMI cable, the company throws in a protective silicone skin and a more robust software package for tweaking your videos after you shoot them. Like the MinoHD, it captures H.264 encoded videos at 30 frames per second with a 1,280x720 CMOS sensor, but saves them as AVI instead of MPEG-4, and gives you about 2 hours of battery life from its removable rechargeable battery (Creative sells extra batteries in case you want to carry a backup). You can also shoot 640x480 VGA video if you want. It has a threaded tripod mount on the bottom; it helps to use a tripod to keep the camcorder steady and ensure your video isn't too jittery.As we said with the Vado, the rubberized finish has a nice feel to it, but it's worth noting that it'll absorb stains more easily than a camera with a hard, shiny plastic finish. It's good that this model is black because when we accidentally touched the silver Vado with the tip of a pen, it left a small mark that was difficult to completely remove. One other minor gripe: we would have preferred if the silicone skin was completely clear or a dark color. It's kind of milky off white and doesn't look great on the camcorder; the device looks slicker naked. We hope that Creative will offer some additional color choices in the future.Like its mini camcorder brethren, the Vado HD has a flip-out USB connector so you can plug it into your Windows or Mac system as if it were a thumbdrive. The unit recharges through USB. When you plug the camcorder into your Windows PC, the software automatically pops up and offers the options of playing videos, uploading them to YouTube (you need to input your account info the first time) or Photobucket, and after installing a plug-in, creating a movie and stringing together several video clips. All in all, we found the software simple to use and the interface elegant. There's not a ton of features--don't expect a full editing package--but there's enough to help you make a little more out of your videos without having to turn to another software package. One nice touch: it doesn't force you to install the software to simply play the video from the camcorder like the Minos do, which is convenient if you're viewing on a friend's system.While the software is designed for Windows users, Mac users can manually drag and copy their videos from the camcorder to the computer and then upload them to YouTube or import them into iMovie or another editing package. In other words, the camcorder is geared toward Windows users first, but it is compatible with Macs.Overall, we were pretty impressed with the video quality. To be clear, this is not a true HD video camcorder--you can only expect so much from a low-resolution sensor and tiny no-zoom lens--but as with the MinoHD, the key is that you can view videos at full screen size on your computer and they remain relatively sharp. Creative seems to bump up the contrast, saturation, and sharpness so the video makes a better first impression, but it doesn't adjust exposure quite as quickly the Mino HD, the white-balance is slightly off (for example, fluorescent light ends up with a slightly greenish hue), and you'll see more fringing around brightly lit objects. We also noticed the same slight judder as we did with the MinoHD.Low light performance was pretty decent, though we felt the MinoHD had fewer artifacts and performed better. The audio sounds about the same: relatively clean, and as long as the speaker doesn't mumble, the tiny mic does a creditable job of picking up the sound.After seeing the results of shooting with each camcorder--and assessing their feature sets--we have to say that it's pretty much a toss-up between the two similarly priced models. The Creative Vado HD has an edge in features, and maybe design, particularly if you want the larger LCD, while the MinoHD has a slight edge in video quality. It's a tough call.Here's the link for the actual review:[...]Update:PC World has released its review:[...]It just won PC Mag Editors' Choice.[...]

$REVIEW.: My issue is that I had 3 separate bass sources, 2x 12&#8221; subs and a bass transducer, and only one LFE output on my amplifier (talk about first world problems).I bought one of these splitters, one of its evil twin (1 female to 2 male), an RCA coupler, and I had everything I need to split that subwoofer output 3 ways, talk about m&eacute;nage a trios!Everything works as it should and my rear sub (which has 2 splitters and 25&#8217; of cable and a coupler between it and the amp) absolutely slams


Signal loss? More like hearing loss.My girlfriend hates me now, and my dog won't step foot in the home theater anymore, but I finally have enough bass to suffocate a canary


Feels good.

$REVIEW.: I used this mount for my 46" Toshiba LCD weighing 52 lbs.  Everything with my mount came constructed as expected - all screws were included, no broken knobs, and the tv mounting plate is square with the wall mounting plate.  The instructions are a little bare-bones, but it only takes a little bit of intuition to figure out what to use and how to do it.  The package ships with a free magnetic 6" level, and the wall plate also has a bubble level built in - a nice touch.  I did run to Home Depot to buy larger washers for the wall lag bolts - the included ones seemed a little small.As others have pointed out, the mount is substantial - 30lbs of steel.  This makes it heavy to hold up against the wall without a buddy, but I managed to solo mount the whole thing.  Using a suggestion described by another, I extended the arms and placed the mount over my head so the wall plate was ~8" in front of my face (as was the built-in level), the arms were resting on my shoulders, and the tv plate was behind my head.  I was able to screw in the top two lag bolts supporting the mount in this way; after that, the mount was secure enough on the wall to drill and screw in the other two lag bolts without additional support.  From there, hanging the TV was as easy as stepping up on a footstool to get up to the right height.Pretty easy to reposition (one arm is a little stiffer than the other, but it doesn't interfere with the motion) and feels really secure on the wall.  Before attaching the TV, I was able to support nearly all my weight (180lbs) on the arms at 1/2 extension with barely so much as a creak; with a lightweight tv at just over 50lbs, I don't worry about this mount having any trouble.Great price (half price on Amazon [$54+$19shipping] vs the manufacturer's website [$90+$30shipping]) and very fast shipping - came 2-day air from Arizona.  I could not be more pleased with this purchase!UPDATE: 6 months later - still holding strong!  Advised to return the TV to the wall after you're done watching it if you have extended the arms out too far.  I left my TV hanging out from the wall constantly when I first mounted it, and over time the hinges mid-arm have ever-so-slightly torqued under the extended weight.  I still don't worry about the mount itself breaking - just don't see any reason to give it an opportunity to sag when it takes 5 seconds to reposition the TV when you're done.

$review_text.: Having first tried the Zagg Folio and Logitech Ultrathin I am now using the Logitech Keyboard for iPad and find it is a good solution for me.  I did not like the extra weight from the Zagg Folio and for that one and the Ultrathin the single viewing angle was not good for me.I find typing on the Logitech Keyboard  to be fast.  Touch typing works well and I don't hit any wrong keys (on the Zagg Folio I kept hitting the Lock key instead of Delete).I already have a "iHome" sleeve with an adjustable stand to hold my iPad so I'm still experimenting if I'll actually use the Logitech's Keyboard case as a stand.  Its ok on a solid surface but on a sofa or bed I prefer my sleeve stand (much more stable).After a week of testing keyboards I've found it hard to go back to typing on the iPad glass so I'm probably a lifetime external keyboard user now.  I'll just have to find a nice small case to slide the Logitech Keyboard and iPad into if anyone has suggestions.One final note for those considering this Logitech Keyboard vs the Apple Wireless Keyboard.  I know the Logitech is slightly heavier (14 oz vs 11 oz) but I find the iPad specific keys on the Logitech (esp the Home key) invaluable.  Others may view the difference between the Apple and Logitech keyboards based on Logitech's inclusion of a case and "stand" (which is a nice bonus even though I'm not sure I'll use it).
$SUMMARY.: Best solution for me even if it means carrying around two items

$review_text.: The strap makes holding the camera so much better and easier. If you don't always want the neck strap on, this is a great alternative. If fully secures to the camera. When using the product, it has to be a little loose so you can still reach all the buttons so don't have it on too tight! The padding of the product is nice and soft, and it also secures to the tripod hole at the bottom of the camera for extra security. It also has a tripod hole at the bottom of the strap so you don;t need to unscrew it when using a tripod.

$review_text.: I've been using them for about a month now as I record some of my movies and like to display them in my DVD/Blu Ray cabinet.They DO have the Blu Ray disc logo on each case.  Although, I do point out, the logo is clear (but visible),..and not white as is in many store-bought Blu Rays.  That's one minor difference which doesn't make me think less of these cases.I've read a few complaints about aftermarket cases and I see a re-curring complaint about the plastic liner that you slip a cover into might rip easily.  Well, I think people have a tendency to over-exaggerate things to add dramatic effect,..and these cases might be a victim of such criticism.  Of the 10 cases I've used so far, one of them, has a half inch tear along the edge where it's heated to mold into the plastic.  Now,..I cannot tell you whether it came like that, OR if it were me, trying to slide a movie cover into it, BUT,...there are MORE things to worry about, than your Blu Ray case liner not holding up to your expectations.Yes, it's nice to have perfection when you pay for something, but the fact is that I payed like $30 or so for a package of 100 of these and I am not even going to think twice, about a liner slightly coming loose.  I mean, how much was each case,...less than $3 ???  Less than a value meal at your local fast food joint.I think I've made my point.  Enjoy these cases, they are just right!  :-)

$review_text.: By way of background, I have never been a fan of Apple's closed ecosystem and forced use of iTunes, the iStore and App Store as the sole source of consumable content (not that we can't free the device with jailbreaking, but that's not for most people).  I haven't bought an apple product since the second generation ipod years ago.  I have also played quite a bit with android based phones and have been eagerly researching and awaiting the release of android based tablets.  After doing considerable research, I have come to the conclusion that android 2.2 (FroYo) is not ready for prime time use on tablet after having some play time with a Samsung Galaxy tab.  Apps have to be scaled up, which makes them look rather blocky and atari 2600 on the Samsung's 7" 1024x600  resolution screen.  This problem is further exacerbated on larger size screens like the demo I saw of the Archos 101 (10.1" with a 1024x600 resolution).  At some point in the not to distant future, app developers will release modified versions of their apps suited to higher resolution/larger size screens.  At the moment, froyo tops out at 854x480 resolution, which will cripple the ability of developers to rescale their apps until either Gingerbread or Honeycomb are released by Google (who has yet to confirm which update will actually allow android to accomodate higher resolution displays).  Don't get me wrong, the hardware on the Galaxy Tab, Archos 101 and Viewsonic G Tablet (this tab in particular) are all quite good--better than the iPad--but without the OS and the Apps, the hardware really doesn't do the user much good.Rather than wait the 6 months to a year before the Android guys get their acts together, I decided to go online and find myself a used 64gb iPad on ebay.  I did this reluctantly, but I wanted to give apple products another try.  The iPad was purchased for about $120 less than I would pay for the same product from Apple.  I did notice that there was a burn in the LCD which caused part of the screen to show up white when the rest of the screen was black.  I have seen this type of defect before and it is a manufacturer's defect that should entitle me to a replacement device.  I registered myself as the user of the iPad and brought my "new" used iPad to the Apple store.  They looked at the issue and 15 minutes later, I walked out of the Apple Store with a brand new iPad under my arm.  Now that's what I call customer service!!!!  Steve Jobs scored lots of points on that.I brought the iPad home, loaded iTunes onto my Dell (again no Apples) and in ten minutes I had the iPad ready to go.  I have downloaded tons of apps since then, including kindle, nook, netflix, hulu +, angry birds, N.O.V.A., NYT, WSJ etc.  All the apps are designed specifically to run on the iPad and they function perfectly.  The device boots quickly and opens apps almost instantaneously.  The battery life lives up to Apple's 10 hour claim.  The interface is smooth and polished.  The device itself is well built and has a high-quality feel to it.  The screen in particular is gorgeous with great color reproduction, inky blacks and terrific viewing angles.  On the whole, this is an excellent product.  I am looking forward the release of IOS 4.2, which will provide the iPad with multi-tasking capabilities, the use of air play and remote printing.  This should significantly improve the iPad's functionality.What the iPad is not:  As others have said, this is not a replacement for your laptop or desktop.  If you are buying this as an alternative to a more traditional computer you will be sorely disappointed.  You can not expand the storage on the device, nor can you connect the device to any external storage, which signficantly hinders functionality.  Most similar devices, including soon to be released android tablets, have microSD slots, USB 2.0/3.0 connections (mini and standard), OTG capability that will allow you to connect thumb drives and portable harddrives--the iPad has NONE of these features. If you're familiar with windows/microsoft products, you'll come to see that the treatment of files is not the same on ios as you're use to using.  You cannot save a "document" or "file" on the iPad.  The iPad's document management system just works in completely different manner.  To be clear, this is a great device for web browsing, reading ebooks, watching streaming movies from netflix, playing games and light productivity software.  It is not a real productivity device for use in place of a laptop.  Although there is some watered down productivity apps for wordprocessing and spreadsheets, this is not going to replace the microsoft word/excel suite that most of us rely on in the business world.On the whole it is a great product with some limitations.  This really a tool for media consumption, not for productivity.  If you can live with the limitations, you will love it!!!

$review_text.: I received this case and confirmed that it is compatible with the new iPad Mini with Retina display. My iPad fits well, and the case includes the cutout for the second microphone in the back. Disclaimer: I ordered in the US from the "More buying choices" idealpoint seller that was NOT fulfilled by Amazon, and I was in contact with a New Trent representative to ensure that I received a case that was compatible with the new iPad. I've uploaded a picture to the customer images section.Construction:* Very rugged build, provides some of the heaviest protection out of any iPad mini case I've seen. I've received several compliments on it as well.* The clips that hold the iPad in the case seem a bit fragile, but they do their job. I don't see myself taking the iPad out of the case much since the upper part of the case is detachable from the arm when I'm looking for mobility.* Hinges are tight enough to maintain a viewing angle suspended above the keyboard.Design:* Excellent. As I mentioned, I received a version compatible with the iPad Mini with Retina display that included the cutout for the second microphone in the back.* Compatible with the iPad's auto-off feature when closed with the home button to the right.* Weight is a bit of an issue, but that's to be expected with a heavy-duty case. The iPad (in its protective cover) is also removable from the keyboard+arm for additional mobility.* Bluetooth sync is easy and painless. No issues with reconnecting even if you forget to turn the keyboard off overnight. I actually always leave it on for convenience; pressing a key will awaken the keyboard, and the next button pressed will register with the iPad.* Typing takes a little bit of getting used to but is very manageable. The only keys that throw me off are " ' / ? since those require the use of the Fn key to type (other keys require the Fn key as well but are rarely used).* No battery level indicator.Overall:Extremely well-built case, but perhaps a bit TOO well-built in my opinion. I am careful with my electronics so I would sacrifice a bit of the protection for a sleeker form factor. However, the ability to detach from the arm is great for when I'm looking for more mobility.
$SUMMARY.: Great, solid case for iPad Mini with Retina display

You're only putting hotshoe strobes and umbrellas or boxes on here, right? More than good enough for that!The only place where construction quality is a question is the threads on the socket clamp. The threads were burred to heck and gone. I pulled it all the way out and ran some 0000 steel wool along them and gave the threads a bit of bee's wax and it's beautiful.For the price?

$REVIEW.: These were Christmas presents for my twin girls. Both computers worked great at 1st. But then the hard drive died on one of them. I had a major run around with Lenovo on getting it repaired. Their website told me I had to take it a local authorized repair company I tried this and after going to the 3 places they listed the 1st two told me do not make repairs on these computers the 3rd one said they could do the repair but just as i was leaving they called me back to let me know that Lenovo had just changed their policy and now they could not fix it. This company showed me the email they had received from Levono and sure enough the laptop was listed as one that they could no longer repair.I then called Levono the following day and at first was told that I needed to take the laptop to a local repair company, I explained that that was not the case and I was put on hold for quite a while. When the person came back they said I was right and would have to ship it to them at my expense for repair. I was not happy about this but what choice did I have so back it went and 10 days later it arrived back with a new hard drive.I will not be buying another Levono product again due to their service.

Yes you will have to rough up the swivel ball to keep it solid when using a heavy lens with a DSLR but this is no problem. I shoot a Canon 60D.  I just used some sandpaper and it made it solid as a rock. With a smaller, lighter camera this would not have to be done. I had to adjust the tightening screws a little to keep the sections from sliding when locked. No problem with included hex wrench. The release latches work very well. I would recommend this Mono pod.

$REVIEW.: This is my third personal laptop and it has quickly become my favorite.  Yes, the specs are wonderful with hefty memory and hard drive space.  However, RAM and gigs do not always a great computer make, so I will discuss the features of the laptop itself in this review.Pros:Easy setup.  The computer loads well the first time with the usual software delays, but Windows and Norton load and register quickly.  Yes, you will have to deal with several updates and downloads during the first day or so of usage, but that's typical of a new computer.  However, you can start using this computer within roughly half an hour of removing it from the box.  The initial setup is relatively quick.  It can take longer if you make your back-up disks immediately, but I delayed this until I had the computer completely set up.Once the computer is booted, there is not a plethora of junk software to contend with on the desktop.  The only icon on my laptop was for the recycle bin.  I didn't have to waste time removing icons or useless software.  None of the abundant memory is being hogged by unwanted or unasked for software.  This was absolutely lovely and I fell in love at the exact moment I realized this.Wireless internet is easy.  Just entered my passwords and I was online immediately.  Of course, this is when the security updates start, but that's to be expected.  The wireless can be easily shut off on the media control strip, so making the laptop airplane ready requires one simple touch of a finger.The media controls above the keyboard are touch sensitive and work well.  They are lit and easy to use.  The touchpad also works well and is slightly recessed, helping to avoid stray mouse movement if you forget to turn off the pad and brush it with a thumb or wrist.  A physical button is provided for turning off the touchpad, too.  (My previous laptop didn't have one and annoyed me no end.)The speaker volume is excellent.  My last laptop never got loud enough to comfortably watch DVDs without headphones.  This one does.There are lots of ports for various accessories.  There's even a port to store the media remote provided.  More about that later.The 64 bit Vista works well and obviously puts the 4GB RAM to use.  This is a fast machine.  Yes, I prefer XP, but so far Vista is treating me well on this machine.Cons:For a 14.1 inch monitor and thus smaller computer, this one is still the heaviest I've owned by at least a few pounds.  An extra empty bay comes in the box to allow you to reduce the weight of the computer by over a pound by switching out the disc drive.  Since I want the drive when traveling, I don't imagine changing out the dock to lighten my load.Whatevers:A small media remote also comes in the box.  It's small and novel, but not necessarily a big bonus.  I can see it being a help if you are using the laptop for internet tv or a Powerpoint presentation and attach it to a larger monitor, but otherwise, it's frivolous for the laptop itself.I'm still undecided on the high gloss monitors found on most laptops now.  They reflect light and are hard to see, especially in bright lighting conditions.  I want to see my screen, not my reflection.  It helps to have the monitor's brightness boosted which happens automatically when on AC power.  I find these monitors problematic, especially when sitting in sunny areas.Extras:It's possible to buy an extended life battery that will last up to 5-8 hours according to documentation.  I've ordered one (HP KS526AA 12-Cell Multi Charge Extended Battery) and haven't tried it yet.  The battery that comes with the laptop gets the standard 2 hour battery that appears to be the norm across most brands.I'll admit that I've been a tower computer user and tend to use my laptop as my portable device, not my main one.  However, I have a feeling this laptop may convince me to make it my primary computer.  This was the best of all the computers I found in this price range.  I was thrilled it was an HP since I've had best results with them over the years for laptops and towers.
$SUMMARY.: Great laptop

 Happy to be returning to HP!

$REVIEW.: I don't have the apple smart case for my iPad mini, so I can't compare the two, but I think this case works great.  It does turn the iPad off and on when you open and close it, and the case itself feels good in my hands.  It doesn't add too much bulk to the device.  I like the color and the style.  I was thinking of buying a smart case before I received this, but now I don't need to.The one thing I'm not sure I like is that lint gets stuck to the outside of the case. This doesn't offer a lot of protection if you were to drop the iPad from a high point onto a hard surface, but all I need it for is to keep the iPad clean and free of dust.  It's more than adequate for that.

$REVIEW.: When i first opened the cable to test it out and make sure it passes a charge, my phone did not react when plugged in. I'm hopeful that's because the computer that i plugged it in to was not immediately finding the drivers. Once i removed it and plugged it in again, the computer did pick up my phone and my phone began charging, so there was a glimpse of hope. Plugged the cable into a wall charger over night and put my phone on it, and it continued to charge, so, for now i will give 5 stars and continue to support my decision if the cable continues to charge. Have not tested my iPad Air yet, only my iPhone 5S

$review_text.: The lights are ridiculously bright.  At night they light up an entire room.  If you're using the netbook in such a way that you can see them at all (often or always), you'll wind up being moderately perturbed as they are as bad as glare on a TV.  If you're using the netbook on your chest at night, forget it.  I started by using electrical tape to shield all four of them, which was the easier option instead of painting JB Weld or something similar onto them.  Now, the tape has fallen off, I'm snowed in, I don't have any more, and don't have JB Weld with me, so the best I can do is stress how much of a failure they are.  They leave spots on your eyes.  Terrible.  I want to dig them out with a knife, but they are integrated with the power button, so that doesn't seem advisable.  Drilling is an option.  My novatel verizon card is pretty bad too, so I taped it down also.  Together they form the most grandiose light-polluting duo you can imagine from a 10" electronic that doesn't need the ligths in the first place.Fix it HP.  The lights are incredibly redundant.  Why do I need a power light to tell me the computer is ON???  It's on.  You can hear it, see it, feel it, and smell it if you try hard enough.  And why do I need a light to tell me the friggin wireless is on?  It's in the taskbar.  And even if these were deemed essential, why make them as accomodating as staring at a keychain led flashlight?  They need to be the faintest LED's possible IMO.  Additionally they're draining battery unnecessarily.The rest of the computer is good and practical.  Windows registry does seem to be beginning it's normal degredation causing strange things to happen, but I can't blame HP.  The price is right.

$REVIEW.: was unable to initially get this thing to work due to a simple missing word in the instructions.step 2 of the instructions say to "push the cable" then twist

push what? where? the graphic shows a twisting motion only


it doesn't show that you're pushing or where
you're pushing a little metal piece of the cable INTO the lock itself, then twisting

the simple word "IN" and/or a graphic showing an arrow going into the lock would have solved this instantly.anyway, i didn't have the weird issue that others had, haphazardly changing the combo to some random thing stupidly
sounds like user error

you really have to try to mess that up...

$review_text.: This is Day 1 for me. Not much instruction comes with the unit, but it's intuitive.  If you've a cellphone or a digital camera, then you should be able to figure out how this works.  The voice directions are clear and easy to follow.  If I don't follow its directions, the re-calculate happens within seconds.One thing I'm concerned is that it doesn't say which side of the street the destination is on.  I went to 2 POI (a grocery store and a hotel) and both times it didn't give that info.  I hope it does have this feature when I use it at other places.I wish it doesn't take so many menus to change from faster time to shortest distance and vice versa.  It should be an option that's prompted for every route (like Magellan's).Report Update:  After 2 weeks traveling with it, I can't believe I waited this long to buy it.  It's so nice to be able to go almost anywhere without printing out maps ahead of time.  Just type in the address and go.  The directions were accurate.I found out that it does give you whether the destination is on the left or right occasionally, just not all the time.One thing I wish it has is a repeat button to hear the last directions again.  I haven't seen this in Magellan's either.  Some other reviewers say that don't like the TTS voice.  It is acceptable to me.  I don't have trouble understanding it.

$review_text.: I have a keyboard case for my Kindle Fire HDX but when I am using my Kindle for watching movies, reading or playing games the keyboard case is too cumbersome. This case is slim and lightweight but holds the tablet snugly in place with 4 border clips without the use of bands. You can hardly see the borderclips so it does not take away from the Kindle view in anyway. The cover has two clips which fit very snugly and at first I had a hard time opening it. Openings for the on/off switch, volume and camera line up very well. You can easily position the Kindle in a horizontal or vertical view according to your preference. The Horizontial view is supported by a flap that stays in place when set up. I like this case very much and would reccommend it to anyone who is looking for a lightweight slimline professionally looking as well as secure cover for their Kindle Fire HDX 8.9&#34;. It will not fit any other model however.
$SUMMARY.: LIGHTWEIGHT AND SLIMLINE

$review_text.: I own Zuiko 40-150mm lens and I'm very satisfied with it. It's 80-300mm equivalent of 35mm (full frame) camera and 55-200mm equivalent for APS-C sensor camera. Lens has very good zooming ability as well as fast focusing even at max. focal lenght (but images are smooth). Also bear in mind, that It extends pretty long - it's 72mm long in "resting" position and 130mm long at 150mm focal lenght. This of course means lens shake so be ready to have tripod or strong hands!Lens are plastic made, with plastic bayonet, but its quality is very high (for plastic one!). I'd give 9 out of 10 overall scores in price/performance ratio. At this price you simply can't find anything better!

$review_text.: I agree with another reviewer, this is a great 2.5" enclosure.  It is bus powered (needing only 1 FW800 cable which is included) and uses all metal construction so it is very sturdy.  Unlike some competing products like the Western Digital Firewire Passport, this enclosure features two FW800 ports.  With 2 ports you don't give up the port and you can daisy chain devices.  I use these to transport my sizable iTunes library between the home and office and also to keep movie content on for a Mac Mini HTPC.Unlike another reviewer I had no problems partitioning and formatting drives in OS X with these enclosures.  I picked up 2 9.5mm 1TB drives for the enclosures and both work flawlessly with all of my firewire equipped Macs (2006 Mac Pro, 2008 iMac, 2009 MacBook Pro, 2010 Mac Mini, 2011 Mac Mini and USB with a 2011 MacBook Air which has no FW port).Usually there is SOMETHING bad that can be said about any product but with this I simply can't think of any.  It just works.

$REVIEW.: You say you want your Kindle Paperwhite to stand up while you read it? No problem. If that's what you want, this is the device for you. I suppose it could be handy to have if, say, you want to read while you eat. It isn't something I want to do, but if you want to, this is a perfect device.And, it occurs to me, this might be great for someone in a wheelchair who can only control things with a stick. This way the Kindle is propped up and they can poke it as needed to turn the pages. I have an uncle in a situation like that. I bet he could make good use of this.Anyhow, if you need a way to prop up your Kindle, this is probably the best way to do it!

$review_text.: This router is much smaller than I thought which is good plus the speed of a 100mb file transfer was 3 times faster than my old WRT-300N (also an N speed router) at the same distance (about 50 feet).In terms of cons, as other people have said here, it is slow to reboot compared to my WRT-300N.  Also, I was disappointed that the shiny textured front is already covered in a whole bunch of micro-scratches when I tried to wipe my finger prints.  I used my cotton t-shirt and didn't even rub hard.  Oh well.  I hope it lasts long, I don't think I'll be able to return it with these scratches on the front, that's why I give it a 4 star rating instead of 5.8/7/2012 Update:I upgraded to the latest firmware,  3.0.0.4.132 which seems to work fine.  EVERYONE needs to be aware of a few things, if you want to save your settings (there is a place in the Administration section where you can save your setting), but do not use Safari.  If you do it will save incorrectly.  I used Firefox for my mac, and I was prompted with a window to open or save the file, you need to save the file.  What Safari does is it opens the file in the browser window, then when you save that file, and then try to restore your settings, it will fail to be recognized.  I had a problem where my 5G wireless just disappeared.  Even when I turned it off from the web interface, the LED would still be lit.  When I turned it back on hoping the 5G wireless would come up, it would still not come up.  I tried various channels with no luck.  It was almost as if my updates were not even having an effect.  I even tried unplugging the ac adaptor several times without success.  Then finally what I did was save my settings, and then just restore those same settings back using the web interface and suddenly I could see my 5G SSID again!  And the minor updates I made to it worked as well.  So next time it "freezes" I think the best solution is to reupload the settings.8/17/2012 Update:I have reduced the rating on this router again from 5 stars to 4 stars to 2 stars.  Not only from time to time do the 5 ghz wireless totally disappear even though the router says it is on, but sometimes you get a connection timeout when you try to connect.  Also I've found before I reupload the settings, I need to do a factory reset, then reupload the settings which is a pain. I think it is the firmware that is causing this.  Even though this router has better range and more functions than my wrt-300N, at least the linksys was much more reliable.11/6/2012 Update:With the poor 5Ghz reliability I can't recommend this router. Sure you could try rebooting or reuploading the firmware but in the end the frustration is not worth it. If you need a 5Ghz router look elsewhere.10/16/2013 Update:I still continue to use this router.  The 2.4Ghz channel is very reliable and the router in general is reliable but I continue to have poor reliability in the 5Ghz channel. Sometimes it is there but you can't connect to it.  Sometimes it is like it is not on at all and the router must be rebooted to get it going again.  The range on this does is not great especially in a 2 story place.  This is probably one of the worst ASUS products you can get...as opposed to the RT-N66U which got great reviews.  Same company but huge difference in product quality, go figure...here is something where they really need to learn from Apple.

$REVIEW.: These speakers have really great sound for the size and price! I listen mainly to classical music these days, and even for that purpose the sound is perfectly adequate.Of course, they are no replacement for a serious sound system. However, if you want to have decent-quality sound for your music or podcasts while traveling, this set is for you.I bring it with me when traveling mainly because I find the quality of my laptop speakers insufficient, especially at the low end. At home, I use a larger set of Creative speakers with a sub-woofer hooked up to the laptop, but this little JBL unit gives those speakers a run for the money.These are not going to give you bass that will shake the room, but there is enough bass to give music as well as spoken-word podcasts a surprising and pleasing richness and depth.It comes with a carrying bag, which is nice, but it would be even nicer if the bag were big enough to hold the AC adapter as well -- that is my only complaint. As it is, the adapter must be packed separately -- bad for absent-minded types like me. A big plus for international travelers is that the AC adapter takes power in the 110-240V range, so you only need a plug adapter, not a transformer, to use it in countries with different power standards.I got these speakers on sale in a Gold Box special for $35, and I've seen them on sale for about that price a few times since then. You might want to hold out until that price or something similar rolls around again. I felt that especially at that price this purchase was a real bargain, though really they are probably worth more as well. Highly recommended!

$REVIEW.: I bought this docking station to allow me to easily add an eSata expansion drive to my Optimum DVR cable box.I found it worked after I ignored Optimum's advice in installing.  They say to add the box with the dvr turned off and the hard drive turned off.They also don't bother to tell you that your goal is to see the &#34;Format disk Drive&#34; pop up screen on the TV.When I followed their instructions, the DVR never really 'found' the hard drive and the hard drive (a 1TB WD) just kept spinning and spinning.  I had no idea what it was doing.So instead I turned off the DVR and turned it back on, then turned off the hard drive and turned it back on, and then hit the DVR button and up popped the &#34;Format&#34; screen by hitting the A Button.  Once I did that it formatted very quickly, and instead of 90% full we saw 12% full.  My wife is pleased.I am glad that I used this particular docking station because it easily accommodates both sizes of hard drives.  You just drop them into the top and they seat on the connectors.  I have never used a device like this before that leaves the hard drive sitting in the open, but after thinking about it, it ought not to matter because the drive is sealed well, and if it gets dusty I will just blow it off with some canned air.  I like its narrowness because it fit well on our bedroom cabinet below a suspended TV.The more important thing is to know that you can do this, but that the Optimum instructions on their web site are a bit thin.  I have also heard stories of misleading or incorrect statements from their tech support about supporting a 1TB hard drive.I might buy another of these to use for various tasks I have with different types of hard drives, checking them out and reformatting them since I build PCs and repair them for friends. This device is quick and easy.

$review_text.: PCT hasn't made new variable gain amps for several years now (at least 3), so people are selling from stock.  This is not a problem.  The product is rugged and should last decades while it sits on the shelf.  When I get rich, I'm going to get another couple to sit on my parts shelf for friends or for my next house.The beauty of this box is the variable gain.At some point, especially with HDTV, more amplification makes reception worse.  This is because the noise is also amplified, and the noise will reach a point where it overwhelms the good information in the signal.  In short, a stronger signal isn't necessarily better.But, you can add small amounts of amplification, stay below the point where you boost the noise too much, and get some improvement.  In my configuration, I've adjusted the PCT to add about 3 or 3.5 dB.  Things are noticeably better with this small amount of increase.  Other amplifiers added large amounts of gain (10 dB, 13 dB), which was too much.The adjustable PCT lets me pick amount I need.  The adjustment screw turns around 5 or 6 times from minimum to full gain, so its easy to ramp up in small increments until you reach the best setting.(If you care, the industry generally gets small amounts of amplification by using a big amp followed by an attenuator to reduce the strength of the amplified signal.  I think that avoiding the over amplification by using a variable amp is a cleaner way to do things.)

$review_text.: When I first  bought this case I got it because it looked like a bundle, you know something that goes and looks good with what your buying, but I was wrong, let me tell you that this case it has to be one of the best FIT and so TIGHT FIT that really protects my kindle every single time, the feeling on the outside makes it not slip away from my hands, and the nice padding inside always protecting the screen makes this case to be one of my favorite cases I wish I had one for my iPad mini and for my nexus 7 2013, and for my Asus memo, do you guys make that case for other divides?

$review_text.: I was looking for a portable external drive and based on the experiences of some of my friends with Western Digital products I decided to give it a shot. When I received it, it surprised me the size of this portable external drive, it is smaller than I expected. I own 2 LaCie's portable drives and this one is smaller.One of my concerns with the WD products that I had seen was the plastic reflective surface finish of the "My Passport Essential" model that according to the reviews it can get scratched easily, well this model has a mate finish that avoids this issue and it looks much more resistant than the other models.I'm still working on how to make it identify & catalog the info in the drive (Music, Pictures, Movies, etc), but it's a minor.Definetly I recomend this for those who don't want to have the "My Book" version and want something smaller and portable as this one.

$review_text.: These batteries have made our phone system work like new.  I was ready to buy a new system and found these batteries, so I thought I'd invest a little to save some money.  Worked out well.  I don't know about the counterfeit problem, I always order from Amazon or fulfilled by Amazon and have never had a problem.  I tried some other aaa size rechargable batteries, but they did not work at all.  Had to remove the batteries and put them in their own chargers, the phone chargers wouldn't work.  So, these may be a little more expensive, but much cheaper than a hundred plus for a new cordless phone system.

$review_text.: Excellent tool for mobility and desk simplification.  Great keys, excellent connection, good battery useage, easy to use, thin and portable, looks nice (people notice) and takes only a small amount of desk space.Ideas for improvement... although it is pretty easy on the batteries (I don't even turn mine off), it'd be great to have a rechargeable option.  I would have liked to have had the full keyboard (numericals) option in bluetooth - but I've gotten used to not having it. A travel case would also be helpful.

$REVIEW.: I am happy to have found this. It protects the back of the iPad 2 with sturdy, thick but light-weight form-fitted molded clear "tray".  Snaps on securely and gives full access to all the ports, buttons, switches, back camera and charger entry (everything). This product actually improves the performance of my Apple Smart Cover when I tri-fold the Smart Cover to sit up in landscape because it gives a bit more weight to the back plus making it tighter against the tri- fold.  All this for an affordable price.  Congrats on this fine product. Not clearly explained is that this product ONLY protects the back.

$REVIEW.: The camera seems to be very sturdy. The book of instructions is very thick and to take the time to learn about it calls for you to set aside time to do that. I've always been a Kodak Easy Share digital camera owner so for me, getting to know this camera has been hard. It's not as easy to work but I'm still learning. I will update this as I get better at it but I can say, this camera you will need to LEARN to use all it's aspects if you are not already familiar with Pentax digitals. I do like it so far and it is very easy to stuff in my pocket. So far, so good.

$review_text.: After purchasing a Kindle Fire I wanted to get a micro USB cable just to have to connect it to a computer.  I actually bought one at Target that cost, I think, twice as much as this one.  Before I used the Target one, I found this one and ordered it.  It works perfectly fine.  Luckily I hadn't opened the Target one so I was able to return it.  I haven't used it other than to make sure it worked once I received it and I haven't had it very long so I can't speak to it longevity or reliability, but I think it will do exactly what I need and is the best price I could find.

Maybe its the DH55HC m'board or the pins setup ( attaching the cooler to m'board ) Pain in the Tukus, you'd think an easier connection would be possibe , after a few minutes cussing ( oh & be careful not to let your screwdriver slip off of the pin ) Finally in there, that was the hardest part about swapping CPU's. To any event it's a done deal, worth the money I'm happy with it & with Amazon for their customer service ( "Don't 'Cha Wish Everybody Did " ) Had bought another brand cooler (w/out fans it turned out ) Amazon exchanged it without hassle Thank YouSo ThermaltakeCooler works for me, I'm happy with its performance ( no overclocking ) ::::Cons: Hate the freakin' attachment pins but its a standard for all coolers I believe

$REVIEW.: The Roku was added to another HD TV since we enjoy it so much on our blue ray player. It was a cost effective way to add Netflix streaming to the family room. Unit worked fine and was easy to install, however I have a DirectTV HD tuner that will not function with a HDMI splitter box (I tried two different models). This is a problem since the only way I can use the Roku is to disconnect the DirectTV box. This makes this purchase a bit of a throw away but its not a problem of the Roku which works just fine with the HD splitter boxes. The TV with the blue ray has four HDMI inputs but it is the only HD TV in the house with 1080P so I cant swap out the DVD with the 1080I TV. Only a problem if you have an HD TV with a single HDMI input.

For the money it is fine
We were hoping because the frame is pretty minimal that even though it was plastic it would look sleek and modern enough to print out a picture and give it as a gift

I have to say the frame looks and feels like it costs, kind of cheap

We will put something in it for us, but would have been embarrassed to give as a present

$review_text.: (WARNING: I am giving this review without the mic in my current presence, therefore some references to buttons' names are as best I know.) I bought this product (two, actually, because I liked the pricing) after having reviewed others' opinions about the microphone's capabilities


I am pleased with the sound quality, but it must be placed on the &#34;tele&#34; setting to get the best sound quality
I found that keeping the mic on the first/normal setting was less appeasing than the respective on-board microphones

I tested this microphone on two Canon camcorders (HF20 and HF31) and a Nikon camera (D5100).I used this in an auditorium and received quality sound, as the microphone was setup more thsan 50 feet from the stage.Cons: NO ON/OFF microphone indicator and no battery power remaining indicator


Hot shoe was too large to fit on either camcorders and squeezed on tightly to the Nikon camera hotshoe

Even filing down the hotshoe, I was not able to place it on the camcorders and ordered additional parts to support attaching to camcorders (parts on their way).Pros: Lightweight


Fit diagonally (with windscreen) into my small backpack with video and camera equipment without being smushed

Decent quality sound (with tele setting).

Also wanted to add this keyboard survived a "BIG" coffee spill, after my g/f's 11yr old daughter knocked my coffee mug off my desk, it was easy enough to take apart and clean each key out and wash down the plastic with soap, and water, and put back together after drying out, and I've had $60 Microsoft keyboards in the past, that took soda spills, and after a cleaning of the same nature failed to work, so yes this is a well put together keyboard, but like my original review might take some getting use to typing on it, if your not use to island style keys, or keyboards in general that have a FN key for the Multimedia keys.

$review_text.: I had hoped that this could work as a ballet rehearsal camera but it falls far, far short of my Nikon DSLRs when it comes to AF performance

The first epic flaw is that the AF points that can track movement are limited to the 9 points in the dead center of the frame


None of those great peripheral AF points will do you any good if your subject is moving or off center


The next fatal flaw is in the shot-to-shot delay
Let me explain.


while the camera can do 8 frames per second, if you let up after a burst of shots it will be at least 1/2 to 1 full second before you can acquire focus and take another burst of shots

I can't tell you how many images I missed because of this shot-to-shot delay

The third flaw is in the EVF itself


While this is by far the best EVF I've used (bright, clear, sharp), and it does have some real advantages over an optical viewfinder, the EVF image lag is substantial when used in low light, so you better have spider-like reflexes bordering on premonition if you want to actually catch a moment in low light


The EVF performance is fine in bright light, but the lag in low light is substantial

I will try the camera again for rehearsal shooting using manual focus and peaking/magnification, but AF is how I prefer to work, so I think I'll probably end up sticking with Nikon for rehearsal shooting

Even if I do manage to nail focus using manual focus I'm going to find a way to work around the EVF lag in low light
For just about every other type of shooting that I do including studio and location portrait work this camera is a lot of fun, easy to carry and use, and delivers very flexible and clean files

Unfortunately it just fails when it comes to one of my favorite types of shooting.

$REVIEW.: I was eager to test this with my new iPad. First, the good news. The iPad fits well into the docking station (though a slight tilt makes me a wee bit nervous). The dock is an effective charging system. It takes little time to get the iPad back to its full strength.The Philips provides a good sound considering its small size. I'm pleased with the richness when I play music from my library.The bad news? Fidelio is the app designed to work with the iPad. It is the worst app I've ever reviewed. Atrociously bad. It simply doesn't work. Why in the world doesn't Philips fix this app? If it did what it was designed to do it'd be an amazing product, and I'd be super enthusiastic. However, the so-called Internet radio is useless. No matter what station you tune it to you end up with buffering, and the sound is out far more than it's in. Maddening. The weather station only works some of the time too. If you research Fidelio you'll see that this is everyone's experience. No one likes this app. Some state that the alarm clock doesn't work either, though I haven't tried it. Philips, get to work and get this thing fixed. I'll change the review if you do.

$REVIEW.: This remote is a simplified version of the remote controller that comes with the Dish TV set-up. It does away with a lot of the buttons that are rarely or never used and replaces them with fewer but larger buttons. It is a big help for those of us who need reading glasses to read the buttons but don't need them to see the TV! It can also be programmed to control your TV. It feels like it is sturdy and well made and will make life in front of the TV a little bit simpler. ONE BIG CAVEAT: This remote uses IR (infrared) signals so it only works in the room with the Dish receiver in the line of sight. It will not operate the receiver from another room without a receiver!

$review_text.: I loved the cables. Colorful, just the right length to use my iPhone 'in bed' away from power.They also seem to be of quite good quality too, overall, not too flimsy, not being erratic in their performance.However, these cables do not seem to be the exact same cables that apple provides.The problem with iPad 1 is that when you use this cable to charge it, the iPad will show up as 'Not in charge', even though it is being charged. It's the same, whether I plug the cable into my computer or the wall socket. This happens when I plug the iPad into my computer's USB socket even with apple's iPad cable- and I imagine that the computer socket provides a bit less power than the wall power socket-, so I think this cable provides a bit less power than the official apple cable. That's fine, though, as long as the iPad is being charged after all.The other problem, however, is that if you have a plastic case of your iPhone, the iPhone side of this cable may not fit at all. Sure, you could say it's the problem of the protection cover, but I think both pieces are to blame at least a little, because this doesn't really happen with the apple cable. I just read some of the 3-star reviews and found out that a good many people have this problem as well.Oh, well, I could probably just take off my cover when I'm charging... :XAnother fact about this cable is that it IS a bit looser than the apple cable. The apple one won't come off just by tugging lightly, but with these cables, that will just happen. It doesn't really matter unless you throw around your iPhone during charging which I don't, but it might matter to perfectionists.Bottom line, I AM satisfied with the product, but with the stellar review it has been receiving at amazon honestly I was expecting a bit more, and if these two issues could be addressed, I'd say it'd be 5-stars.

$REVIEW.: ****  WARNING: If you buy this DO NOT connect the black wire!!!!  There is a black wire coming from your stereo.  This is the GROUND.  That can be attached to any metal piece you find inside your dashboard.  The black wire from this adapter is a LIVE WIRE.  While you DO connect all the like-colored wires together, DO NOT DO THIS WITH THE BLACK WIRE.  If you do, you will blow a fuse in your car, and possibly ruin your new stereo!!!!  This stupid adapter had ZERO instructions.  All the other wires make sense: power (positive and negative), speakers, etc. - but there's this BLACK wire that makes you think "OH I should connect that to the black wire from the stereo" - DON'T DO IT.  ZERO STARS for this adapter containing a superfluous wire that turned a simple car stereo install into a NIGHTMARE!!!!!!!  *********-If you've never done this before, let me explain:  The factory-installed car stereo that you have now is plugged into the dash.  There are 3 plugs: Power (not shown here - no adapter needed there), speakers/antannae (larger plug you see on the right in the photo here), and maybe extra speakers/subwoofer (smaller plug you see on the left in the photo here).-When you take out your old stereo (GOOD LUCK), you unplug it, and take that plug and stick it into this adapter.  It will fit exactly into the white part of the thing you see here.  Now, the other end of this thing is nothing but exposed wires.  See, those wires you need to splice/twist/solder onto the wires that came with the new stereo you bought.  See, the new stereo has it's OWN little plug thing that looks similar to this.  Only it's its' own version - Sony, Panasonic, whatever.  They're all different.  When you are going to install your stereo, you take the plug from your new stereo, take the adapter you see here, twist tie and tape the wires together (they're all color-coded the same - you don't need instructions), then go back to your car and plug one end into the new stereo and the other end into the 2 white wire things sticking out of your dash.

$review_text.: I thought this thing would work perfectly as a way to interact with my google-TV.The battery housing is such that the battery contacts don't remain in constant contact with the terminals






leading to spotty performance.After one month of use, the battery doesn't hold a charge, so the only way I can use my &#34;wireless&#34; keyboard is to plug it into a usb charger with an extension cord on it.The keys don't seem to catch every click

 Sometimes they capture 2 clicks.Now, I don't know for sure how much of the key-click problems are related to the keyboard or to the googleTV device I have
 If I had it to do over again, I would have gotten a larger-sized keyboard, with a bigger battery.

$review_text.: The first Anker Wall Charger I received did not hold the charging cables very well.I wrote to the company- hoping to exchange the unit, perhaps.Much to my surprise- unlike several reviewers who felt tech support was not listening; I quickly got a reply and an offer of a replacement.I sent them the serial number- not the wall charger- and quickly received a new wall charger at'no charge' (sorry for the pun).I have had no over-heating issues or any other problems

My only suggestion is larger/colored arrows and names for the Apple and Android ports.Not all of us have 20/20 vision anymore- or ever did


Oh


it wold help if the instructions specifically stated the best output for recharging the Anker Battery/Charger I bought with the same order- rather than reading a recommendation in the reviews


Neither issue is a deal breaker- I'd buy- and probably will buy another Battery/charger in the near future.However, thanks to the tech dept
for their replacement offer and quick response.

I was using a very old full size laptop with no HDMI to connect to the net with WiFi and using its s-video port to drive my TV.  I got fairly good results from the old computer but when I saw that the Acer Aspire One at a local warehouse discount store had an HDMI port, I bought it hoping to improve my screen resolution.It worked great. I bought a very cheap (Eforcity)HDMI cable from Amazon and connected to the TV's HDMI port and it worked fine. I was surprised that I didn't need an audio cable. The image is very clear and I can now read the smallest script with no problem. The WiFi connection was much better than the marginal performance of my old laptop.  This is a great little computer. No trouble with the setup and so far so good.

$REVIEW.: I recieved this external HD as a gift and it seemed to work fine, unitl the day it just stopped working. Western Digital's customer service was very easy to navigate and they sent me out a replacement drive very quickly along with a RA nunber - of course my credit card information was required to insure that I sent back the defective drive.The WD Smartware software is a pain. The user interface is not exactly friendly or intiutive and should you happen to forget what your password is, you're pretty much toast - even if you decide to reformat the drive.  The Smartware interface makes absolutely everything else on my Windows XP OS run just that much slower. It would also be very nice if I could use this drive as an external HD and I could see actual files, rather than having it so the user cannot even see what is on the druve. It's wonderful as a backup - I think.  I guess you just have to simply trust that the Smartware is doing its job.I have a 500 GB portable drive that I use far more often for file storage and accessing those files is a breeze by comparison. I doubt that WD will be my first choice if they do not do something about it being so user unfriendly.

$review_text.: These USB-powered speakers are well-made and powerful enough to fill a small room

They have no battery and no aux input and work only plugged into a computer USB port

They sound quite clear on voice but tend to be boxy and shrill on rock, better on acoustic stuff
Clearly they're intended for casual use, especially to travel in a suitcase


If you place these on a desktop with the little 2" drivers pointed at your face 2 ft away, they are so hot as to be virtually unlistenable; tilting them back 45 degrees (or more) mellowed them out a bit..

The bass is surprising given their small size- I don't doubt their claimed response of 80Hz
The headphone output is excellent but the very short, captive cords are a pain
I'm using them with a USB extension cord.After 30 days of use I gotta say these a fine value
A little judicious equalization via iTunes helps: a few dB of boost at 60Hz gives them much-needed weight without causing them to overload; -5dB at 4k takes out the screech
Not bad


The headphone output is actually quite good, a little wooly in the bass but decently flat from there up and it drives my Sennheisers LOUD.

$REVIEW.: First off, I've only been using this for a couple of hours, so I can't speak to its reliability or long-term quality.  The keyboard does feel solidly built, despite a very slim profile.  Many parts of the keyboard seem very well thought out, including the feel of depressing the keys.  However, people who use the Windows Context Menu button will find that this keyboard lacks one.  The closest button it offers is the right-click button below the track pad, but you have to use the track pad to select an item and not the arrow keys for it to work.  The track pad is also in a terrible place.  It should be centered on the keyboard so both left- and right-handed people can use it.  As a left-handed person, I find it extremely awkward to use.  The keyboard set up easily on Windows XP without installing any software (just plugged in the Bluetooth device and turned the keyboard on).  However, I recommend installing the software because it adds many additional features and customization options.  The battery life is great -- it came out of the box with a half charge, which equates to 30 days of use remaining, according to the software battery indicator.Update:  I've been using this keyboard for almost two months now and it's been wonderful.  I've only charged it once since I bought it and I never turn it off to conserve battery life.  If you install the software, it will tell you when you have 5 days of power left by showing a battery icon in the system tray and also periodically illuminate a low battery indicator on the keyboard.  I downloaded a very small free program called SharpKeys that allows me to customize the keyboard keys, so now I have my Context Menu pull up by hitting the Insert key (which I never use for anything else anyway).  I never really got too used to the scroll-wheel touch pad, but I did buy a 2.4Ghz Logitech mouse so I just use that most of the time.  I use the keyboard with my 40" TV across the room so text on websites is sometimes too small to read, but the convenient zoom buttons on the keyboard take care of that quickly and easily.  It has been responsive and reliable!

$REVIEW.: For the price, I expected garbage, but instead I got a fairly well thought out little socket. It has enough threads to safely hold a 85 watt CFL (compact, yeah right...) and the cord is long enough for most uses. I like that the bottom of the stand where the light stand attaches is shaped specifically for that purpose. This means the light stays in one position and doesn't turn or swivel at the top of the stand, nor does it tip in one direction or another (I'm looking at you, Studiohut Double AC Flash Light Stand) with an umbrella attached. I bought two, just in case one didn't work, but they both work fine and now I have an extra!

$REVIEW.: I purchased these plugs sight unseen, slightly skeptical about their effectiveness using them in a new THX receiver. Once I put the first one together which was almost the easiest part of the speaker installation (wall hanging, etc.). I plugged the first one into the socket. I then could tell by the snugness of the fit, that there would never be any oxidation between the jack and plug.The twenty piece set came with the screwdriver and a packet of extra screws, which you won't need if you make your connections over a table should you back the screw out too much and drop it. I had no problems and you shouldn't either.Hands Down the best Quick Connect/Disconnect solution on the market, flat out! Also aids in ease if you need to reposition the receiver for any reason.

$REVIEW.: I've wanted a plasma since 2009 but never wanted to pay the entry price.  Got in on a smoking 2012 Panasonic UT50 deal at the beginning of the year but the Pilot freight monkeys that Amazon used delivered a box full of broken glass.  So I waited some more.  Finally I see that this set is getting great reviews as a no frills plasma.  Price is right so I pull the trigger.  My first reaction was OMG this is an amazing set.  But after the newness wore off I quickly discovered just how DIM this set is.  No amount of tweaking could change it.  Then to make maters worse I discovered this 3 letter devil on an acronym... ABL.  For those that don't know, if the picture gets to a certain brightness level (say a sunny scene, or a commercial with an all white background) this set will automagically kill the brightness.  It's a TOTAL buzz kill.  So now you have dirty whites AND dim scenes.  I thought I could live with this since I do most of my TV viewing at night.  Nope.  It is just way to dim.  Promptly packed it back up and sent it on its way to Amazon.  Who knows, maybe I got a dud.  I really had high expectations for the inky blacks and blur free images that plasmas produce.  I think I'll just settle for higher caliber LCD instead.

$review_text.: I have used the same card in several (3) different laptops, and although all were running Windows XP, the setup was different every time and the reliability has varied too. It still won't work with my HP Omnibook 6000 (not at all!), but worked in 15 seconds in my Compaq 725. Go figure!! My original review is appended... worked and then it quit. I had to call Linksys (on a Sunday at 10 AM, wait time was less than 5 mins) and spent 45 minutes on the phone with them figuring out what was wrong. When we finally tried all the tweaks, it was working like a champ. However, we did so many things that neither the tech nor I could possibly know which one thing was really the issue (was it the firewall setting, the DHCP, the WEP?....we'll never know). Anyway, in my one-story ranch home, a good quality signal fades beyond 60 feet. When placed right next to the antenna (which was how I did the set up), speeds approach those of the wired PCs on the network. Anyway, if setup were easier, I'd give it 4 stars.
$SUMMARY.: Unpredictable.

$REVIEW.: I bought this watch strap primarily to hold my Nano while working out


 It has some good points and bad points.Pros:- The iPod snaps securely in place

 No worries that it will fall out.- All of the buttons are easily accessible and are oriented in a logical manner


 If you don't know, the face of your iPod can be rotated by placing two fingers on the screen and twisting in the direction you want it to go.- You can plug in your headphones and they are long enough to give your arms free range of motion while wearing this wristband.Cons:- For a woman, this is huge
 It's not fashionable, or discreet


 I don't mind, because I use it as a workout accessory, but if you want to wear it all day as a watch, you might not be thrilled.- Because of its size, you have to be careful not to smash your iPod into anything
 I came close a few times.- The first time I used this was on the treadmill

 About halfway through my workout, it started to get uncomfortable, and was damp underneath

 By the time I finished, rivers of sweat were tricking down my hand from underneath the wristband

 Taking it off, the back of my iPod was completely saturated


Yikes
 I've since used it with cotton rounds stuffed underneath it, but that looks ridiculous.In summary, if you don't mind its size and don't want to use it to work out, it's great

 If you're looking for something daintier or to use at the gym, you'll be disapponted.

$review_text.: There's cheaper mp3 players out there, but I've found that in general they're garbage- often with faulty flash memory, poor UI and display, and very flimsy


This player can be had for $30 and at that pricepoint, it's really good for what you get.The Sansa Clip Zip is larger than an iPod shuffle/nano but has a nice display and pretty decent color UI

Construction is quite solid- I wouldn't be worried about dropping it
Battery life is good, volume is good, and it has a large clip design
The unit is small and lightweight- not quite as small as the latest gen iPod nano but not a lot heavier and still very manageable
It's also a whole ton cheaper and has expandable memory via microSD
It also has a radio receiver and mic (not great, but it does work).The battery is non-removable, but the unit is cheap enough that I wouldn't be worried about having to replace it in a few years
It uses micro USB to sync/charge and comes with a (very short) cable, and data transfer speed is decent


It also comes with earbuds, though they're nothing to write home about
You might want to grab some third party replacements- these work but aren't great


The case comes in a variety of colors
Buttons are all physical, which although this isn't the 'hip thing' anymore in this age of touch-everything, can have its advantages


In particular, you don't need to look at it to use simple controls- you can do it by feel.I've used the older-gen Sansa models including some of the very first ones
This one is a major improvement and shows that SanDisk is still actively improving their mp3 player line


In some respects (particularly, expandable memory) these are even superior to the iPod
Overall I'd say the nano is still a better player (especially if you still have a lot of iTunes files with DRM, or want to play movies), but we're talking a $150 device vs


a $30 device

These are much more giftable in cost and- when you get down to it- really do a fine job.

$review_text.: I purchased this card about four months ago for an older computer. Since then, this unit has been shifted to other computers on two additional occaisions. I found that the ports work much faster than most factory installed usb ports when using the "orangeware" software upgrade. The unit was recognized with windows xp pro without any upgrade but I found it works faster with my wifi adapter with the orangeware drivers installed. I recently purchased a new computer and moved this card into my son's computer. He uses the usb ports on this card exclusively because they perform better than the ports which came with his computer. This was my first "Belkin" purchase but it certainly won't be my last. I think this is a very well built, high quality product and would gladly reccomend it to my friends and family.Update: May 28, 2012. I have now been using this item for almost 2 years. It has been swapped out into 3 additional computers and it's still going strong. I wish all my electronic products performed this well. I'd also like to give "special thanks" to all of the other people who posted reviews on this product to assist my initial purchase. Amazon reviewers have been a tremendous help with all of my purchases.
$SUMMARY.: Excellent product. I highly reccomend this card!

$REVIEW.: I purchased three of these drives when they were discounted as a Gold Box Deal of the Day.  I installed the three drives in an external eSATA RAID enclosure and configured them for RAID-5.  The performance throughput from the drives has been more than adequate, and I have had no hints of failures like those that other reviewers have reported.  The drives are not particularly quiet, but I'm not really concerned about that since I'm more concerned about performance for use in photo and video editing.  Unless something changes in regards to reliability, I'd definitely recommend these drives.

$review_text.: I purchased this as my first HDTV back in August of 2009 and she is still going strong. After calibrating it using the Spears and Muncil calibration Blu-Ray, the screen is perfect in my view. Colors are vibrant and the picture details are crisp. Very good black levels for an LCD as well. This really is my favorite HDTV and it makes me sad that Sony stopped making it. I have the 40" incarnation and now four years later, I'm looking for something similar but bigger and having no luck. Sony seems focused on LEDs and 3-D now. Blecch.Ideally, I would be able to find a 60" version of this exact TV for my new, much larger living room, but after being let down by a Samsung plasma and not really being blown away by any of the LEDs on the market, I find myself coming back to this TV in all its glory. This really is a wonderful television.The only major flaw was a firmware issue where the Auto Contrast Enhancer was permanently stuck "on" causing the screen to dim automatically and at inopportune times, but a firmware update available on Sony's web site enabled a menu option that allows you to turn it off. Once you install the update, you're good to go.I use this TV for regular television program viewing, sports, Blu-Rays and video games and it performs wonderfully for all of these tasks. The 120 Hz dejudder works great for live sports as well (although MotionFlow should not be used for regular programs or movies as it produces an unnatural effect).The menus are straightforward and easy to navigate with no unnecessary bells or whistles - and it's a good thing too because if you are a videophile like me, you probably have different specific preferred settings for movies, games, sports, etc. This TV has four or five different video presets which can be modified to your liking - allowing you to toggle between them on the fly quite easily if you are going from a movie to sports, sports to game, etc.All I can say is that having seen other HDTVs through friends and neighbors, this is still the best HDTV I have ever seen. Even still today four years later when people come over to my house for the first time, their jaw drops when they see the picture and they ask what type of TV it is. No joke.When properly calibrated and with the firmware update, this Sony Bravia is pretty much flawless.
$SUMMARY.: Everybody remembers their first...

$review_text.: It worked perfectly from the instant I turned on the power after installation.  I have Vista-64 and three hard drives and this makes the second disk burner in my system.  I've burned and played Blu-ray movies, HD movies, etc. and it seems to do everything beautifully.  It would be redundant to repeat all the features, but it is really nice when something that does so much actually works as advertised.  It must be good because they raised the price 10% since I bought mine here on Amazon in July.  I bought a 4 port SATA II expansion card here on Amazon that works great with it. Search for PCI 4 Internal SATA II Ports Controller Card - SIL3124.  I strongly recommend both of these products.

$REVIEW.: Final Update: I'll be passing this unit along to my son, who will take anything IT. Replaced it with a WD MyCloud that is not perfect, but WAY better and faster.Update: Reinstalled firmware(I think, but I got no "success" message). Still can't see shares in Discover. Tried phone support, but got disconnected while waiting to speak to a human. Called again, they said they were now closed until 1:00 CT (1.5 hours). Then I got the unhelpful response from Seagate below.I struggled with this thing for a very long time after spending a very long time setting it up with the ponderously slow browser interface. There is, at least, a little tab at the top of the page that alerts you that it is "processing." I set up the RAID, users, shares, etc. easily but slowly. I found this part of the interface user-friendly, other than being very slow. When I tried to assign passwords, it told me I could not use some special characters in passwords. It did not  tell me NO special characters, so my passwords had special characters.Then, I could not map any shares. I could not ask support, because they get off work too early. The troubleshooting pages were simply a waste of time. After a long search, I read that the fix for not being allowed access to shares in the Discover program is to reinstall the firmware(!). It took hours to download it and I had to quit for the night without trying. When I finally tried it, it did not help. I have not mapped shares so far, though I have since accessed them.And, I could not access the shares to transfer files. I could not get it to accept user/password. I struggled with this for a long time (while the firmware was downloading). I think that eliminating all special characters from passwords  was what finally allowed me to access the shares. How can modern network hardware not accept ALL special characters in passwords?The advertising neglects to mention that you have to set up web access to use this unit with an Android phone. I have not got that far, but that is what made my last NAS unworthy.Once I was able to access shares, file transfers went more easily. Stuff transferred through my computer from a USB-attached drive to the server at 10 Mb/s.

If you want a good camera that can reach out and capture wildlife this is a great choice. There's lots of awesome digital cameras out there to choose from. I'm happy with my Kodak. It seems to be easy on batteries, takes a great picture and is easy to handle. If there is any downside it's that it does too much !!!

$REVIEW.: This is the 3rd power pac since I bought the laptop in 2007.  I wish I could say to you "don't buy it because the cable breaks after a year" but if you bought the laptop, you are pretty much stuck with this and have no other choice. What makes it even more outrageous is the price of this item listed on dell's parts store: over 65 bucks!  For the money I have paid for these 3 I can get a brand new netbook!It is amazing how things are less expensive on Amazon than on "official" sites.  For example, this vendor charges only half the price for the same item - although it is still expensive in the absolute sense.

$REVIEW.: I used a Sony point and shoot for eight years and thought that maybe it is the time to switch to something fancier but not dSLR yet.  Therefore, after studying the available options, I narrowed it down to Nikon P100, Canon SX20IS, and Lumix FZ40. The Canon was a good candidate but a little on the heavy side. The Lumix had some color issues and I decided on the Nikon. So far, I love it. It is light, full of features and gives you a lot of manual tuning to play with. The menu and controls are just perfect. After studying the manual, I started shooting Auto then in priority modes and even in manual modes for experimenting (you can see some of my pics in the customers photos in amazon). The video is also nice but you can hear a buzz sound from the zoom if used (not as loud as you might think like the Fuji ones, but you can hear it especially if you are filming in a quite environment). I think it is a very good option for someone who wants to move from the point and shoot but still not at the dSLR point yet. I guess it is a keeper for me and will only buy dSLR after this one (after mastering the manual shooting). I am still learning, but quite impressed after 3 weeks of using it.  As you see below, most of the Cons (in my opinion) are minor and i can live with them.To summarize:Pros:- Good build (sturdy), ergonomic and very light.- Excellent powerful zoom.- Very nice macro shots.- Great menu and options can be easily reached.- Nice pictures and colors.- High speed continuous shooting at 10MP! wow!!!- High speed video recording (it is fun).- View finder, which comes handy in direct sunlight situations.- The LCD, which tilts up and down by 90 deg, is quite handy in several situations.Cons:- A little noise in low light or with high ISO, which is normal for non-dSLR I guess. But you can always limit the ISO in the settings (which is nice).- Slight zoom sound in the video recording.- No RAW (which is weird!!! why would Nikon take RAW off this magnificent camera?).- No remote shutter (again, why would not Nikon consider having a remote for this camera???)- Cannot install standard filters on the lens. That would have been really a BIG plus if Nikon allowed it to.- I would loved if the manual focus was done using the command dial instead of the multi selector.UPDATE (11/10/2010): I have returned the camera today. I found out that the noise level was bothering me more. Add to that no RAW means wasting more time touching and fixing the images. Also, since I was interested in landscape images, I wanted the freedom of having filters and remote shutter. This is still a great camera, but not for the things I will use it or need it for. I am trying SX30IS and will write a review about it in the next couple weeks.
$SUMMARY.: Very nice hybrid

$review_text.: I purchased this soft shutter release after much research, perhaps too much research.The build quality is solid and without compromise.  It is neither concave or convex.  It is flat on top with a very slight bevel.  The soft shutter release installs very easily and it is not easy to misalign threading. The release feels great on the camera and does not seem to loosen at all, after a thousand &#34;clicks.&#34;  The release fits nearly flush with the X100s shutter release and shows no &#34;play.&#34;  It feels as if it is a solid and logical extension of the camera.As I noted, this release fits flush with the camera shutter release.  Some may prefer a soft shutter release that is taller such as the Boop or bop or those made by Artisan (wood). Personally, I find that taller soft releases are likely to get entangled in my bag.
$SUMMARY.: Simple Solution that Works (Fuji X100s and X100)

$REVIEW.: A lot of truckers use the BlueParrot which looks like a $5 dollar headset from 1980 with universal remote control buttons on the side.  This RoadKing is more up to date.  I was worried about the sound amplification as a lot of Bluetooth headsets are quiet, but this one is so loud that I have to turn the volume down a little.  The only con is that it fits a little too tight on my head, but I am currently trying to stretch it out which seems to be helping so in time it may loosen up.  Also, when fully charged a blue light remains lit and it is the brightest light I have ever seen.  It is like a large blue laser, you can actually use it as a flashlight it is so bright. Two little things, but if they make the band a little larger and remove the Audi headlight that lights up the whole area when charged, it is great.UPDATEI managed to stretch out the band so now it fits comfortably on my head.  The bright blue light doesn't bother me in my truck, but when I charged it in my house it was extremely bright where the room is pitch black dark at night. I am happy with this purchase and will stick with this brand for bluetooth trucker headsets.

$REVIEW.: I did not purchase this item through Amazon but through Staples.  They had a $30 coupon code and I was being cheap.  I've learned my lesson.  Below is a copy of my review that I posted on Staples.com:First let me say the only reason I purchased this through Staples instead of Amazon was the $30 coupon code. Staples has become aggressive and quite competitive but it appears to have come at a price. The packaging used to ship the item was a flimsy cardboard which could hardly be called cardboard. The box arrived partially crushed. Inside, the inflatable air packaging was deflated thus providing no benefit whatsoever. I've never had such a poorly packed product in all my orders placed through Amazon. I'll be returning there in the future and would not recommend Staples for anything easily broken.That being said, the actual box for the N7 survived relatively unscathed.I've purchased a number of tablets in the past and this is by far the best. It's the perfect size to hold in one hand, to carry along with you, and is quite capable.The latest version of the Jellybean OS is a joy to use as I've encountered no lag at all. Apps load quickly and run flawlessly on this device. The camera's are just so-so, but can't deduct a star for that as that's pretty normal for tablets. Besides, do people really take pictures with their tablet? Phones seem much better suited for that task and I'm betting most people who have a tablet also have a phone.The screen on the device is absolutely beautiful with good color saturation and a very hi-res screen comparable to Apple's "retina" screen on its devices. The high resolution makes even the smallest text readable.As the device has just came out, I can't really comment on reliability, but it does feel very solid in the hand and, despite the low cost, just feels like a quality piece of hardware.I would definitely recommend this tablet as it is one of the best tablets on the market and, for the price, you simply cannot beat it.

$REVIEW.: I've had this unit for almost 2 months and I'm pretty impressed with it. Going through the manual online makes me believe that there are so many features that I have yet to unlock. Am I surprised that the manual is in PDF format and not in the box, no. Many PC games have been doing that. I find it easier reading the manual on my computer because I know it won't get ripped and/or lost. An added feature is zooming in and out on the manual. Basically, you can have large print or small print.I've taken this cute little GPS system on 2 excursions and back and fourth to work. First off, when I initially used it, the GPS locator got my positiin within 2 minutes and soon after that, the traffic reports were showing up. You can easily change the traffic reports you get either for your route only or over 15 miles or more away. I live in New York and I was getting traffic reports as far away as the Bronx to New Jersey. Yes, the only icon on the Navigon screen shows a few cars on the right side of the screen and you hear the voice say, "Caution." If there was more detail, I think there would be way to many accidents from people who love the "eye candy" on the screen showing a more detailed traffic report as you drive. Going to and from work, I pass a few major intersections on the parkway and as far away as 1/2 mile, I was getting the lane assist showing me were I should be. The signs even matched the actual intersection. For example in New York: Traveling west on the Northern State Parkway there is an exit for the Long Island Expressway. About a 1/2 mile before it, the voice was telling me to stay in the middle lane (or stay left). The signs on the lane assist showed the Northern State Parkway on the left and the Long Island Expressway on the right. Very Nice and acurate.The online manual does state when you charge the Navigon for the first time, and turn it on, you must calibrate your voice to the Navigon so you can do the voice destination entry. It took me a few times to get the voice address correct but it did work. When you calibrate your voice using the voice activation, you will notice that the Navigon voice is very loud. It was for me! I had to turn it down at least by half.The touch screen can be a little frustrating. Sometimes it will respond to a light touch and sometimes it won't. Also, unlike the main menu which has a big area to touch, the minor menus (such as: when retrieving a saved address, the depth of the traffic reports, and the zoom in and zoom out button on the map just to name a few) is not as responsive and sometimes you have to tap (or tap hard) a little "outside of the box," to get it to respond.The menu system on the Navigon is very easy to use and navigate through. I find it is much easier to navigate than the Tom Tom and Garmins. On one particular Tom Tom, it was very frustrating. Before my Navigon unit, I had a GPS system built into my car. When I traded it in, the new GPS system was over $2600, so I skipped it and did some researching on other GPS systems. My father has a Garmin and a coworker has a Tom Tom. I borrowed theirs and right around that time, I saw an email from Amazon saying that they just recieved a new GPS system. I was impressed with it. I could of gone for the cheaper Navigon but it had a smaller screen. Yes, my new car has Bluetooth capabilities (Microsoft's Sync) but I wanted the bigger screen. At the time I bought the 7200T, the price difference was only $50, so I got this one. I'm glad I did.The routing (more about the routing later) was quick. The screen is beatiful (2D and 3D) . My eyes aren't the greatest, but I saw the letters and number easy. The colors on the screen were good and the signs were big enough.I did try hooking my cell phone to the Navigon and it was a little troublesome, but eventually it did work (not in my car because Sync grabs it as soon as I enter my car and turn on the ignition).I did notice that even if you chrage your GPS system in your home, if you don't hook it up in the car, it's going to die within 1-1/5 hours. Plus the power source needs to be connected in your car for you to recieve the traffic reports.While driving, the points of interest (POI's) were popping up like crazy. Gas stations, resturants, local CVS's were all showing. I zoomed out and panned into Queens and pressed were a restuant is, it gave me its name ( it was a pizza place). More than enough POI's if you want my honest opinion.What is also cool, is the 3D map. I drove into Manhattan (rarely) to meet my brother and the Empire State Building was there in 3D (very nice, I might add). I must also add is that the speaking voice on the Navigon 7200T intitially is loud and I had to turn it down at least to halfway.The routing was easy to create. If I use a route a lot, I can save it. I saved the route that we took into New Jersey since my wife's aunt lives there. Originally, the route, was different than what I would normally take but the system was basically taking me through a shorter route. The only minus was that it took me to a very heavily used expressway and would of gotten me into traffic. Thinking about it now, I wonder if the 7200T realized that there was no traffic on the expressway and that's why it was trying to get me to go through it instead of staying on the parkway that I was presently on. At the time that we left, there was no traffic until we hit the George Washington Bridge. The lane assist came on to tell us to get to the lower part of the bridge and I remember seeing the traffic sign saying that there was light traffic on the lower side and heavy traffic on the upper side. It was quite possibly getting us to were there was no/minimal traffic. Yes there was traffic on the Upper side of the bridge (I stayed on the Upper side because that's were I always go when we have to go to see her Aunt). I am going to see if my route changes when I go to work. I leave in the morning when there is mostly heavy traffic (I'll post a update).A noticeable quirk: Sometimes the directions are a little goofy. If you don't know were you are, then it might take you the "long way". For instance, usually a parkway has two exits (one north, one south, or one west and one east). I was driving southbound on the parkway and the Navigon told me to get off going west but I had to make a left turn (illegal) when I exited. It didn't tell me that I had to go eastbound when I get off of the parkway. This was the second time I noticed this. The best thing to do is to check the directions first (after they are calculated) and then go to the map screen (when it starts talking the directions).All in all, yes this system isn't perfect but it's definately a cut above the rest. The menus as well as navigating (no pun intented) through them was easy; route planning was a sinch, the speaking voice was loud ( I had to turn the volume down to half), the traffic reports are a nice touch but it would of been nice to see or hear them since the reports are actually on a seperate window/page. Yes, when you hear caution, it's good but knowing what the actual report on the highway is, would be nice. If you have someone in the car with you, then it's no big deal. You can't beat free traffic reports! The updating program that you download onto your computer is easy to do and updates are easy to get. No problems. Registering the product was a piece of cake. If you get the fresh maps which is an added accesory is about $60 but you get a full years worth if there is any updates to the map. Not bad considering that my other car that had the GPS system built in wanted $99 for the year to update the maps. The lane assist is terrific as well as great eye candy. The 3D map is beautiful (not gorgeous as in WOOOOOOOOW! but very nice). The bluetooth needs work but that could be in an update. I shrug my shoulders when it came to the bluetooth, but people who need it, will be annoyed unless your car has the bluetooth capabilities. I would give Navigon 7200T about 4.5 stars. It's not perfect but is defiantly a cut above the rest.Amazon was good. I elected to use the Super Savings delivery and it took almost 2 weeks. This was the first time this had happened. Usually when I elect to choose the super shipper saving, I get my product either the next day or within 2-3 days. At the time when I ordered it, I believe that it was a very popular item so Amazon's warehouse on the east coast didn't have this particular model but their Arizona warehouse did. UPS also had a different delivery date than Amazon had. What is also sad is that the price drop guarantee was stopped as of September '08. Whenever I order from Amazon, I always check to make sure of any price drops. I didn't know about the elimination of this practice and I was a little aggitated since I do a lot of shopping on Amazon. The customer service reps are mostly nice. Before I ordred the Navigon, I did get some jerks who don't know how to provide customer service. It's a shame also that New York State forces Amazon to charge sales tax on all orders shipped to New York State. Bummer! I still continuously shop at Amazon though; to earn my points. I've already cost them $100 in gift certificates because of my reward points!*Update*I've noticed that people had said that its directions can be wrong at times. I tested this notion yesterday. I set the address in the Navigon and it routed me to the place that I definately new the directions on how to get there. I followed the route even though I knew that it wasn't taking the route that I always take. I trusted it! In fact, it took me to my destination and showed me a shortcut.The only quirk was what I mentioned. It told me to get off at an exit (westbound exit) when I should of gotten off on an eastbound exit. When I refused to listen to the Navigon, it reloaded new directions and they were correct. So to anyone who gets nervous when using the Navigon; Have faith in it. It will steer you correctly. Sometimes it will give you a shortcut, sometimes it might take you on a route that it calculates and it might take longer (making you shrug your shoulders wondering). All in all believe this: It will recalculate the directions if you are not going to "reach your destination" that you feed into it. (If it tells you to make a right turn, and it's a one-way street and you go against the traffic, don't make the right turn. When the Navigon figures that you didn't make the right turn, it will recalculate...quickly. I had that the other day, and I still made it to my destination.It's not perfect, but it's an awesome GPS!

$REVIEW.: I gave the product a 4 star rating only because installation is a bit difficult

The protector is necessary if you want to protect your ipad screen from unnecessary scratches

The protector is clear after installation and does not have any impact on touch screen sensitivity, you can hardly tell it is there
I would not use my ipad without it
Installation is a bit tricky
No matter how hard you try you will end up with a few lint bubbles that you cannot work out


Do not take it off and try to re-install it, if it is not absolutely perfect, it will only be worse the second time you try

Do your best to make sure the protector is aligned properly before exposing the sticky side and applying it to the screen
If it is not aligned properly, the upper and lower holes will not align with the Ipad camera eye and home button

Make sure you clean the screen well with the provided cloth and sticky lint remover, this will minimize the amount of lint bubbles that cannot be removed


Have a second person help you gradually remove the sticky side cover as you are gradually applying it to the screen
This will make it a little bit easier

If all else fails, you have a second protector that you can start over with and/or you can buy another set


They are inexpensive

Good Luck

$REVIEW.: Returned the first one because the optics wer not aligned. Basically it was cross-eyed.  The replacement was better but the focus adjustment (pin) sheared on the fouth time using the binoculars. Now there is no focus unless you can slide the eyepieces out just right to simulate the focus action.  This rarely works and the eyepieces generally just fall out.On the bright side, it LOOKS impressive sitting on the window sill looking out over the water. Just dont touch it, like an antique telescope.

$REVIEW.: Things I really like...Live view.You can magnify the image on screen 10x's so checking focus is very accurate. Also, you can see the exposure change on screen while you are trying different settings. The same is true for white balance. Not sure which white balance to use? Put it in live view and try all the presets and see which one looks the most accurate. This is very helpful! Live view is also great for taking low level shots that wouldn't be possible if you had to look through the viewfinder. Also, it is great for overhead shots. Works great if you are in a crowd and cannot see your subject. It is also good for candid shots. Being able to take pics while not looking through the viewfinder helps you get very natural pics. (No posing or looking nervous that their pic is being taken) Also, Live view is 100% view. Very helpful! What you see is what you get.6.5 frames per second. You can get the exact shot you want when you subject is moving. Or, if you don't have a lot of light and you forgot to bring a tripod, fire away and one of your pics will be sharp. You will have to delete a lot of crappy pics but at least you will have one pic that is not blurry.Easy navigation through menus. The top knob goes from menu to menu and the wheel on the back goes up and down the menus. This is a very efficient way to do this.Auto ISOSometimes I use a higher ISO than I need to for low light situations. Auto ISO helps you choose the exact ISO you need. The lower the better.Comes with a cord to be able to look at your pics on a TV. I love using this to review photos before I download them to the hard drive. I get rid of the duds before they start taking up needless room on my hard drive.3 inch screen makes it much easier to read menus. Also, reviewing pics is easier. The screen is brighter than previous models so it is easier to see it in bright sunlight.ISO in viewfinder.Spot meter. (could be a smaller circle but this is not a huge deal)Low noise levels at high ISO's. It helps you get decent low light pics until you can afford the very expensive wide aperture lenses. Also, it helps you get more depth of field when the their isn't a lot of light to work with. ISO 3200 is surprisingly useful!Custom menus-saves time if you have to switch settings in a hurry.Highlight Tone Priority; It gives you more dynamic range. Less blown out highlights with very little downside. (It takes away ISO 100 and ISO 3200)Shutter speed 1/8000. Amazing!! You can use large apertures in very bright sunlight giving you a very shallow depth of field affording you more creative options. I took some hand held pics at this setting the other day and it looked like I used a tripod! I zoomed in a lot and the photo was very sharp.10 Megapixels. Leaves you lots of room to crop and still print big pics.Things I don't like...Flash must be used for auto focus assist in low light. It should have a separate light for this.View finder not 100% view. (but live view is!)White balance is not accurate for indoor lighting. I have to use an expo disc or gray card to get accurate colors inside. Apparently Nikon is better at this. Canon needs to catch up in this area.Having to purchase different focusing screens. The Nikon D300 comes with different focusing screens.The 40D not a perfect camera but it is a really good camera and the price is very fair. I enjoy using mine and the picture quality is excellent. I am learning that photography isn't all about equipment. It's about finding a camera you enjoy using that inspires you to take pics. The 40D makes me look forward to taking pics every time I use it! Thanks Canon for a great camera.

$review_text.: I bought this to use with a 2.5mm stereo cable to extend the speaker/mic on a ham portable. I was surprised by the sleek look of cables and connectors - the molded ends are significantly smaller than the 2.5mm stereo cable, and the connectors themselves appear to be of a very high quality. Cable loss is much lower than the 2.5mm cable, good because the 3.5mm cable carries mic audio, and you can't just &#34;jack up&#34; the volume to compensate for cable loss. It's a very impressive cable, and I wouldn't have any qualms recommending it to someone with a need for a 3.5mm extension.

The first time it did it I was able to get it to work again by restarting my modem, but when it did it again I couldn't get it to do anything.  Won't pick up a signal and won't connect.  I've never had this type of trouble with usb adapters.  I'm not sure it's worth the price in the end.  You save a little money, but it's just not reliable enough.

$REVIEW.: It came well packaged and everything. Synced it to my Wii U fine. I wear it all the time. and the games you can do on the Wii U with it is amazing! I have had it for over a week now. And I am not that overweight but it tends to fall off some of my pants. I guess that could happen to any pedometer. The Meter doesn't look broken or anything. I like how it has a little lanyard hole on it so you can add a lanyard if you want. The stepping is not totally accurate either but I knew that would happen before I bought it. Other then this, I am very pleased with it! I have Wii fit on the old Wii and was not as motivated as I am with this. Totally recommend it! :D

So, I can fit the D70 with 20-70 zoom attached, a 100-300 zoom, and 50 fixed in the bag


There's also a zippered side pocket, good for memory cards, small stuff


A flash would probably not fit well in the side pocket.The sling design fits nicely on your back, ala fanny pack style


There is also a belt to secure the pack, if your riding a bike or something like that.The top of the bag is easy-access, with a quick release clip
There are also two side clips that help secure the top flap as well.I think this bag is great, I spent a lot of time trying other packs on and sizing them for my gear setup

IMHO, this pack is the perfect marriage of portability, comfort, and capacity.FYI, Tamrac makes several other sizes of the Velocity, there is a bigger pack, as well as backpack style if you need to cart your entire studio around

$REVIEW.: Sure. This thing looks awesome but the chord looks like it'll snap any second. I've had this product for 2 hours and the jack already shows signs of deterioration. The jack solid but too long. The length of the jack will probably lead it to many accidents. Sure, it'll protect the headphone jack from breaking (in which if failed to do so in these 2 hours) but will probably damage whatever its plugged in if the jack gets a little pressure. I guess my only reason for keeping them is the lifetime warranty. I'd really much rather get a lifetime warranty for my j4, I'd def pay for that .EDITLooks like aging it increased the sound by a crazy amount. I didn't think it was possible. The jack also somehow fixed itself. Weird stuff. So like give this thing a chance! Don't write a review the third time you use it like I did.

$review_text.: For the t2i I think its plenty sufficient


For the price difference, its worth taking a look at

If you put a PREMIUM on absolute stability while tripod mounting, you maybe a tad disappointed with this as it will give you the slightest little bit of wobble


This might be the case with all grips though, but compared to my 1D body there is of course zero wobble

But there's also a lot more surface area for my camera plates on the 1D -- but just something to consider nonetheless
If you mostly walk around with your camera sans tripod and just need more battery life -- by all means this will get you by.

$review_text.: I've had prior experience with a 17inch laptop before; i owned a Gateway 6860fx and it was a bad experience. I hadnt used a 17inch laptop since then until i tried this Dell 17inch. After a month of having this in my possession i really like it alot; and would definitely recommend it for those looking for a mid-tier 17inch laptop for everyday use. The following are the notes i've taken in my month with the product:-I got roughly 3 hours on highest performance setting while watching Netflix. General use, you can easily get 4hours.-It takes roughly 1min to open from cold boot. From standby it takes like 10 seconds.-The lcd lid doesnt have a latch or anything. Just pull up to open. Because of this it doesnt open very easily and you need to use both your hands (one to pull the lid , the other to hold the bottom down)-The sound levels produced by the speakers are adequate.-Very rarely gets hot on my lap, and its very quiet... even when I did some stress testing on the CPU.-I think that the build quality is great. The gateway 6860 started breaking down eventually but i dont see that happening with this one.-The indicator lights on the front are small and hard to see. The power button doesnt have any light.-Really can be considered light-weight for 17in: Its 5.8 lbs with a small ac adapter. (my old gateway was 9.2 + it had a huge block ac adapter)So it wouldnt be to much of a pain to carry around, especially since AC adapter is so small and the computer itself isnt thick either.- webcam quality was great on my calls via skype.- Max resolution is 1600x900. But the overall quality is nice even though i did have to adjust gamma and contrast ratings to my liking cause i felt they were off some.Other tidbits:-Touchpad supports multitouch gestures(eg pinch zoom , two finger scrolling)-5.6 windows exp index.-685 GB usable from the 750GB HDD, but also had 35GB already used by windows 8 and bloatware-Textured surface is nice but a fingerprint magnet. You can see the places your fingers touched.

I typed on it okay but, you can feel the screen protector hit against the screen every time because it's not flush.Overall the case is still okay but, they should've just made a commuter series case for it (this is the only one I could find for the active - no commuter)

$review_text.: The "Home Theater" universal remote by way of the "IR Blaster" is essentially worthless
As someone else said, a $20.00 remote would do a better job

Don't buy it for this extremely unsophisticated feature


Also, it only works in portrait mode, so you must turn it to see the darn thing
The blaster is so weak you have to pick a one pound remote and point it just to turn down the volume - which is about all you can do with it anyway
I understand the Sony S does a much better job at this.The GPS feature seems interesting but this is pretty big and heavy for that, yes? And it comes with no app that can do routing while in your car

Thanks for that.The Vtab takes all night or day to charge and runs down in 4 -5 hours with any video played, which makes it barely portable at best
Also, the "power cord is short, stiff and generally unwieldy
There are pluses to this thing

The sound is pretty good, but not really loud enough as I run it maxed out when watching video
The biggest plus for me is that it streams Flash video pretty well with the installed Flash 10.3
Also, the screen quality and resolution is really very nice
This unit does not seem cheap in any way when holding it
The 8", 4x3 screen is a bit small for me but that is a personal preference.I have a lot more to say, but I'm out of energy

I am pondering as to whether I will return it even though I paid under $200.00

In my opinion, it's worth about $125.00 at best - stripped of all the stuff that doesn't work right.

$review_text.: I saw mostly good reviews and ordered it, hoping that poor reviews involved operator error

I followed the directions for installing the drivers on two machines - an ASUS notebook running Windows 7 (64 bit) and an HP notebook running Vista


I also went to the IOGEAR website and updated the drivers (from V1.0 to V1.1)

The auto-switching worked perfectly, just as advertised


I had one glitch, which involved the notebook running Windows 7

Although the device would switch to this computer, the printer sent a printing error and wouldn't print from that machine


I went through the IOGEAR troubleshooting checklist to make sure I had done everything correctly (including making sure that the printer drivers were installed on both machines and the printer operated with a direct connection on both machines)
When I still got the printing error message, I used the IOGEAR support website and wrote an email, sharing complete info on the hardware involved and the problem
Within two hours (or less) I got an response saying: "On the Windows 7 computer go to Devices and Printers, right click on the printer icon and Printer Properties (not just Properties) then go to the Ports tab


Under the list of all the printers look for a check box labeled Enable Bi-Directional Support, if that box can be uncheck do so then apply the change to see if that helps." That instantly fixed the problem
Now it switches automatically AND prints off both notebooks
LOVE IT!UPDATE: April 9thI've just changed my rating to four stars
Everything I said before is true, BUT...my scanner on my HPL7590 All-in-one has errors and won't work


I tried just uninstalling the GUB211, but unfortunately that didn't fix the problem
I had to completely uninstall my printer too, and reinstall
I want scanner capability more than I need the ability to switch between PCs, so I'll just do it the old fashioned way and swap the USB cable between PC's instead of using a switch.

$review_text.: I bought this to replace the broken digitizer in my old iPod touch. It went through the wash three times, and the third time finally killed it. Or so I thought. The iPod actually turned on when I plugged it in, however, no touch worked at all. I figured, what the hell, for 12 bucks I can replace the digitizer and it can live to see another day. The install was pretty simple, however, it seems the replacement digitizer is still semi broken. There are dead zones, it isn't as sensitive or accurate as the other one, and I'm not sure what to make of it. Judging from all the other positive reviews, it's likely that the digitizer is fine but there are other issues with the iPod given its history. Seeing as how I only use it when mowing the lawn, I can live with it being kind of glitchy as long as I can coax it to play music.If you plan on replacing your digitizer, you likely already know what you're doing, and this is likely the one to get since it's the ENTIRE front assembly. I would definitely recommend buying a good spudger if you don't have one already, and accept the fact the rubbery part will likely be somewhat damaged when you're putting your new digitizer on. If your iPod isn't as damaged as mine was, it should bring it back 100% :)

$REVIEW.: Worked well

Used two of them to travel with a family of 5 to France


Built pretty well
Used for items that were already set up for 110/220 - like our camera charger, iPhone chargers, computer chargers, etc.I like the fact that you can plug in a couple of devices into it.Remember this is not a voltage converter! This is only an adapter


If your device is not set up for 220v, you must buy a more expensive voltage converter
Most hotels and houses have a hair dryer already - but if you must use something like a curling iron, this WILL NOT WORK unless it is set up for 220v already
(Read the label on the device - it will tell you if it is)
Again, you will need a converter, not this adapter.

$REVIEW.: Though this is a cheap camera, there is a point where the quality is so bad that it isn't even worth a fourth of the price. With video cameras, you can't really go too cheap if you want any sort of good quality, though for around $30 more, you can get a little handheld hd cam from a better known camera making company. If you get this one, though, you're basically wasting $60 on a product with the quality of a happy meal toy and the production price of $15

$review_text.: Could this bag be better? Absolutely


Why am I giving it 5 stars then, you ask? Because right now, there just isn't a better tool for the job


I just returned from a 2 week landscape photography hiking expedition to Northern Oregon's Columbia River Gorge, and this bag did it's job beautifully.The bag is very well made, very comfortable to wear, and holds enough stuff to keep you shooting, eating, drinking, and warm & dry the whole day out
It rides very balanced on the back, and distributes the weight very well


I did not experience any fatigue or pain after hiking many miles through rough terrain with this bag fully loaded.In and on the bag, I carried:Canon 6D BodyCanon 17-40mm f4 L lens with hoodCanon 70-200 f4 L lens with hoodRokinon 14mm f2.8 lens with large cover capFull set of 6 Cokin P type ND filters, in individual casesCircular PolarizerIntervalometer / Timer wired remoteSeveral Memory cards and batteriesmultiple lens clothslarge rag for wiping camera and lens down in wet conditions1 32 oz bottle of spring water (I didn't buy the separate Camel Bak hydration system part yet, but it would have fit just fine.)6LB Aluminum Alloy Manfrotto 055XPROB Tripod with Manfrotto ball head, strapped to the bottom of the bag using the straps made for that purpose1 warm hooded sweatshirt1 pair of swim trunks for wet conditionsAnd other nicknacks I'm sure I'm forgetting.And because I didn't use the Camel Bak part, I could have fit my 11&#34; MacBook Air (or even a 13&#34; Pro probably) and a full size iPad in the compartment as well, separate from all my other gear.The sections are well padded and isolated from one another

Your camera gear stays in the dedicated side loading area

Buckle the waist strap and you can slide the pack around while standing in waist deep rapids to unload your camera or change lenses safely

Your miscellaneous personal gear can go in the upper compartment, and a Camel Bak or laptop can go in the front compartment (closest to your back)
You can also fit an iPad in either there, or in the sleeve area on the back of the bag.If I were to nitpick, here's what I would like to see improved in a 2nd generation of this bag:The straps should have a bit more padding


The back is very well padded on your back, but my shoulders got red a bit from the straps (not really a problem, as I was carrying a ton of weight, but I think it could be improved some).The upper compartment is just a huge cavity
I think it should have some padding and compartments to enable you to use it for more lenses or bodies, as opposed to being unprotected so you can only really use it for personal effects.The camera compartment is a bit tight


I think a full-pro body would be a very tight squeeze

My 6D was snug fit in there with its tripod foot and strap attached
The lens compartments need more dividers
Two of my lenses rub on each other, and my camera touches my telephoto

Not cool
I used my folded strap to separate them, and had no issues at all, but I think this could be fixed with more padded separators.To beat this bag in this same form factor, you could buy a large FStop backpack, which holds much more, but costs more than double the price


So for the money, this is the best deal going right now.

$REVIEW.: I am very fortunate to have had for over a year a Logitech Z5500 speaker set
The fidelity is consistently outstanding - My only problem is that as I live in an apartment I can only make satisfyingly good use of  its power when the neighbors are away


I feed the system by a Creative Titanium Fatality  Pro sound card in my computer, which has the ability to synthesize 5.1 ausio from 2 channel inputs as is the case with some DVDs


I have the card connected to the speaker control box by a single lead S/PDIF optical cable


I also have a Comcast (Motorola) HD channel box connected with a single coax cable and fortunately Comcast, at least in this Atlanta area, boroadcasts quite a lot in the 5.1 format


The Z5500s ahve operated flawlessly for as long as I've had them, and the listening has been extraordinarily satisfying


its true that the set is somewhat expensive, but the price varies considerably be supplier


I feel that they are truly worth the investment, and can reccomend the set.If you get a set you are in for a truly enjoyable experience.

$REVIEW.: These are a great beginner binoculars for the new birder who can't justify spending hundreds or even thousands of dollars on a high-powered pair

My family has had various types of Bushnell binoculars for generations and we've never been disappointed with a single pair
This pair is comfortable to hold and not very heavy so they're great to take on a long hike or overnight trek
 They also have a great field of vision and a surprisingly clear view for the price


 That being said, you shouldn't expect to pick out every detail in high definition


 The image is crisp enough when you consider you're paying less than $50, but you're not going to be bowled over by it

 They're a great starter set and excellent for casual backyard birding, but if you're looking for top of the line, look elsewhere.Also, the carrying case is comfortable and does a good job of protecting the glasses


 It's only soft shell, though, so if you're looking for something to take some hard knocks on a boat or mountain bike ride, you might want to invest in a sturdier case.

$REVIEW.: I purchased the ReadyNAS NV+ before Netgear bought Infrant.  The unit worked flawlessly on a Gigabit Ethernet allowing users to share files and as a print server for over 2 years.  Suddenly the unit died with a "pop" and the smell of a fried power supply.  I called Netgear and eventualy spoke to a "technical" support person.  He told me that the unit was no longer under warranty (1 year for Infrant boxes, 5 years for Netgear boxes) and that Netgear can not provide any repairs.  I jokingly commented that I should just throw the unit away and buy a new one- the rep said that was my best option (guy was American).  It gets better- power is needed to remove the 4 drives from the box.  I asked the rep how to get the drives out of a dead unit.  He put me on hold while he inquired with a "hardware engineer".  He came back on and told me that the engineer recommended that I search the Netgear NAS user forum. The call ended with the tech guy saying "Thank you for choosing Netgear products".  I expected more from a "top rated" product which is designed to prevent data loss.  BTW: I googled "ReadyNas NV+ replacement power supply" and found that PC Connection sells one for $115.UPDATE (7-5-09): The replacement power supply had the Netgear logo with the workings surrounded by a vented heat sink type enclosure.  The kit included additional mounting screws.  The PS aligned perfectly into the base of the NAS box and has been trouble free (as of 05/23/2010: 14 months).UPDATE (5-23-10): Replaced the chassis fan from AMAZON back in Dec '09- an OEM Netgear unit when I heard the "sounds of bearings gone bad".  The fan unit cost $25 and fit the chassis frame perfectly out of the box.  Took about 30 minutes to first thoroughly clean out the accumulated dust and install the fan.  The unit has operated continuously since I purchased it almost 4 years ago.  I plan to take the unit off-line every six months to clean out dust- the unit could double as an air purifier ;)UPDATE (11-10-12): Storm caused electrical surge and blew out the second PS. APC wall mount surge protector could not save it.  I also lost a eSATA port multiplier.  Replacement PS readily available- 20 min repair.  PSD lasted just over 3 years of continual use.  I hope Netgear keeps the basic design of newer models the same- these PS seem to be the weak link in the system- same four WD 500 GB drives for 6+ years with no issues.

$REVIEW.: I have been using this AC adapter since August 2011 and I haven't seen any indication that this is a cheap product. The reason I like this adapter is because the plastic build, unlike cheaply build ac adapters, doesn't deform from all the extensive heat that is produced from within the adapter. I am currently using this to charge my ASUS 1201n. While I can't speak for all laptops that use this adapter, my ASUS 1201n does overheat when I'm using the adapter and the laptop at the same time, but I solved the overheating issue by using a small cooling fan that plugs into the USB port, that provides more breathing room. Like I said, I haven't noticed any signs of change in the adapter physically, which means the quality of plastic is pretty good to withstand the heat. Plus, it charges really fast when my ASUS is off. If I need an AC adapter I would by from Anker.

Shipping was fast and the power adapter arrived with no physical defects and in perfect operating condition. On the outside, the adapter appears to be physically identical to the one furnished with my Dell XPS15 laptop.  It has Dell markings and the interfaces match exactly (right down to the blue lighted ring on the laptop side of the plug). The unit simultaneously charges and operates my new laptop (130 Watts required). All and all I'm very pleased with this purchase and would buy from this vendor again.

Software CPU level up (Overclock) does an excellent job also, no crash or anything, just some memory frequency issues that caused programs to auto close.Stability wise depends on memory, for me so far has been un-eventful, installed G.Skill Trident X Series DDR3 2400 Model F3-2400C10Q-32GTX and when playing games, program auto closes.  Tried auto, XMP (profile1/2) same issues.

$REVIEW.: Great little detector which works very well. The only downside is that I cannot really adjust the volume to a softer level - it still is  rather loud even if set at the lowest volume. Detects radars from front AND rear which I find very helpful!Would buy it again!

$review_text.: I used this RAM in my 2009 Macbook 2.26 (white unibody) and while Apple says that this computer will only handle 4GB of RAM, it accepts 8GB just like the 2.26 Macbook Pro version. Noticeable decreases in boot time,  can have multiple apps running without much lag, and I haven't had nearly as many spinning beach balls. Overall, my macbook just seems smoother, especially on Lion (gestures have an immediate response now). Go ahead an upgrade. Well worth it!

$REVIEW.: The USB 3 interface makes this drive very fast. Transfer speeds around 60MB/sec - similar to eSATA! Design of the case seems sturdy, but it is wider than the older design, which I preferred. The USB 3 cord is a little short but it is very flexible and easy to use - I have seen others that are very stiff and awkward.I did run into a serious problem with this drive when using the optional eSATA cable. When using eSATA, the drive would disconnect after about 8 minutes of use. Searching Internet forums showed that I was not alone. Seagate tech support was of no help and I ended up returning the drive and eSATA cable. At first I thought my computer had a bad eSATA port and I even purchased a new eSATA cable and another motherboard. In the end it seems that there are eSATA compatablity problems.If you intend to use only USB 3 interface, this drive may be good for you, but don't rely on the eSATA capability. I might note that eSATA did work ok on my neighbor's computer, so it is hardware dependent.

$REVIEW.: Before I purchased the card after researching the Creative web site for linux drivers. The X-FI card was specifically mentioned. on the site as being usable with the drivers. When I attempted to compile the linux driver they was an error. (Note the driver should compile even without the hardware being present). When I sent I query  to Creative's web site I was told that it was an oem card to contact the Computer manufacturer fro the drivers, and  they only supported windows XP and vista. I am returning the card as it is useless without the drivers. In addition I will be very careful about purchasing a CREATIVE product in the future. From my response from creative customer support they neither had the desire nor the knowledge to help me.I must say that Amazon and the vendor  are not at fault here as support should be offered by the manufacturer not the retailer. Also if they are not prepared to support the code don't put it on the website.

$review_text.: I have in the past used plates by Dayton Audio, which I really like and typically get through Parts Express, and Pyle which have some limitations but also some nice features.  For a third of the price of the Dayton's, these work just fine if you're not needing to go with top of the line components.The posts are simple 4mm banana/8mm spade/4mm wire on both sides, although due to the density of posts using spades might be a challenge.  For this project I used direct connected wire in the back (14 gauge, folded over wrapped with a piece of conductive-adhesive copper tape), and Nakamichi banana plugs in the front.  I did unscrew the nut in the back of the posts to change the orientation of the post hole so the wires come in at an angle...personal preference.The plastic plate with the posts has a good amount of play room for mounting which is really appreciated when using with other face plates.  The lettering is well imprinted; it does not appear that it will rub off anytime soon (which I have seen with cheap plates).Only thing I would have liked more was to have the subwoofer post be RCA in front and F in back since I'm using RG6 to the subwoofer and prefer a screwed in F connector in the back...I don't like to have anything inside the wall plug-in.  Again, personal preference and there's probably just as many folks that prefer the RCA-RCA post or don't use it at all.  I guess I could say that having a screwdriver notch in the thumb screws would be nice, but then, if that's what I want I'll get the Dayton's!  I'm giving it 4 stars, not that I'm subtracting a star for any specific reason, but just simply "I like it" and would buy again if I need an inexpensive plate.

$review_text.: I've had every iphone since the 3Gs. I'm a real fan. However the fact that Apple changed its connector and charges $29 for a damn cable is ridiculous. Why on earth would anyone pay almost $30 for a cable that ferries electricity (and data) to your phone? Also the fact that apple has a smart ID chip that verifies authenticity just makes me more angry. If they didn't have the stupid verification chip in the cable maybe it wouldn't be $29! They are literally trying to squeeze every penny out of us.That said, this cable is fantastic. It does what it's supposed to be, and doesn't fall apart within a few weeks like the super cheap ones from China. The fact that I purchase it for less than half of the Apple cable makes it worth every penny.

$review_text.: We have two Kindle Fire devices and found that even with years of experience in applying screen protectors, this brand did leave bubbles, particularly at the final edge that was attached.  When the device is turned on, the bubbles aren't visible, likely because of the matte finish.  When using the Kindle Fire, I really like theGreatShield Ultra Anti-Glare (Matte) Clear Screen Protector Film for Amazon Kindle Fire (6 Pack)for the protection, lack of deterioration to the touch screen responsiveness, and ability to somewhat reduce the glare, but when I turn the Fire on or off, I am irritated by the dull areas of bubbles along the outer edge.  The packaging for these screens is simple, with the instructions printed on the interior of the envelope style lightweight cardboard.  The application directions are very easy to understand and follow.  Enclosed is a nice little cloth for wiping the screen and applied screen protector, and it's also helpful for encasing the enclosed small piece of cardboard or your own credit card which is to be used for smoothing out any bubbles.  For around three dollars each, I'm hoping each fine fitting sheet lasts for a least a few months before needing replacement.  I'm all for protecting our Kindle devices!

I wanted something to use while listening to music in the kitchen because I was tired of just cranking up the speaker on my phone.These speakers have been living on top of my fridge for the last two months and get a lot of use.  They are plenty loud to hear over the noise of the dishwasher or other appliances, and the treble/bass adjustment is a welcome addition.  They look pretty good to boot.Overall, an excellent option for those looking for a set of quality speakers with excellent sound on a budget.

$review_text.: When you look at the pricing for Macro lenses you might be easily skeptical with the quality of this Macro lens. I was to the point where I took my camera body to a photography store and asked to use it in the store. I was immediately impressed with its close up qualities and the ability to easily create the "bokeh" effect when shooting my daughter running around the store.  I did not purchase it on Amazon (but I normally do) just for the level of service and courtesy that this photography store provided.I was double impressed with the lens once I got it home and was able to shoot outside and indoors. The pictures are stunning for close up objects and it works equally as well as a portrait lens. I don't claim to be a professional and I'm sure that a $700 Macro lens has features for a professional that this doesn't offer. When I run into problems with this lens I suppose I'll find out what those features are.Happy shooting - enjoy if you buy this lens.

$review_text.: This hub comes with 4 USB 3.0 ports (2 on each side), 24 USB 2.0 ports (6 on each side and 12 facing up), 1 USB 3.0 uplink (facing left) and power supply (facing left). Power supply has 100~240V NEMA 1-15 unpolarised plug, and 5V 4A 3.5mm connector (small standard). Each port can be controlled by a separate button. Bought in Oct 2012 and still alive in May 2013. Also bought another as a gift. I call it a USB AIRCRAFT CARRIER!Works with my Dell laptop. Charges iPhone over USB 2.0 ports. Never made any device incompatible, slower or insufficient powered. Can still work without power supply.This is the product definitely you need for heavy duty usage, for the following reasons:*You don't need all USB 3.0 hub. New external hard drives, flash drives and card readers need USB 3.0. External network adapters and video adapters might be USB 3.0, but they are rarely used. Other devices like printers, keyboard, mouse, joysticks, ciphers, and serial adapters will never become USB 3.0, since USB 2.0 even USB 1.1 is enough for them. Also using multiple USB 3.0 devices will become slow and not better as USB 2.0. But you need USB 3.0 as uplink so USB 2.0 devices won't interfere with each other.*Large USB 2.0 hubs are bad. Bandwidth is limited in USB 2.0, and multiple devices make it slower. You need USB 3.0 uplink for multiple USB 2.0 devices.*5V 4A is enough. You don&#8217;t use it to charge a bunch of phones. You don&#8217;t use more than three external hard drives at the same time or they will become slow. Flash drives, keyboard, mouse, ciphers, and serial adapters only need a little power, while self-powered devices like printers or 3.5&#8221; external hard drives need no power from the hub. If you need more power, connect  powered USB 2.0 hubs to it. They are very cheap. For USB 3.0 devices, connect directly to the computer.*Most USB 3.0 hubs have no switches. With this product, you can easily turn off a device to extend its life without plugging it out.I strongly recommend this product as far as mine still works.

I was installing into a Win7 64 bit computer.  The web site for downloading drivers is very confusing and poorly designed.  And Win7 wanted to identify the modem in PNP as a different manufacturer.  By doing so the modem working for accessing dial tone but didn't work for my caller ID purpose.  Discovering that I had to manually delete those drivers and tell Win 7 to install the drivers I had downloaded.  Once that was done things fell in to place and started working.

$review_text.: I was happy it was a heavy duty stand. It feels solid and doent wobble. I like I can use different widths since there are 4 center poles. I dont like that after the first time I used it and went to put it away the screw stripped out on the center height adjustment and we had to take it apart and my husband rigged it somehow to put enough tension between the pole and tightener piece to hold the pole in place where i needed it to. I worried this will be an on going issue. I hope it doesnt happen to another one. It would be nice if they supplied a few replacement screw cap parts too. I barely tightened it when it broke so if I lose another in the near future I may return for a replacement if its possible or find another brand. The carrying bag was actually pretty nice It would be great if both ends had the round zipper opening but it seems well made. Overall Im hopeful the stand and bag will have longevity. I would be very upset if i had payed the &#34;actual cost&#34; 200+ like it said but for $58 its great

$REVIEW.: I have had my N3250w for about a week now.It is not a Sharp Aquos, but costs about half as much.I have not had any problems with it at all and it was fairly easy to hook up and use.  I've left it on for a week because all digital electronic stuff will usually blow in the first 100 hours if there is a defect.  I have used a Viewsonic 19 LCD on my computer for 3 years with never a glitch, and a few Viewsonic monitors before that. Good quality stuff.The sound quality is great and the picture is better than most low end LCD's.Source input types, using S-VHS cables, component cables, and decent sound cables make a BIG difference in the picture and sound quality, which is true with any TV monitor regardless of price.  My Lite On DVD recorder coupled with the Viewsonic in progressive mode, is excellent.I bought the 3250 to replace a Samsung 32" HDTV flat CRT TV.  It had a great picture and sound, better than this LCD, but it weighed 150 pounds and was a pain to move. I kind of miss it because I like the 4:3 picture better than 16:9.  But the living room looks roomier than with the Samsung and the Viewonic is easy to move around and get to when I need to change cables, etc.My only complaint is with choosing sources. It's a little slow and requires cycling through about 6 or 7, or using the Menu function.Some reviews mention a sanpping sound when turning it off. It think it's because they have the sound up to high.  Maybe because they turned off SRS Wow. If the sound is at 35 or less when turning it off, that does not happen.I have an olded Dishnetwork receiver. I find that turning off the 3D noise reduction using S-Vhs improves the picture.  Each source should be tested.  In most cases the default or Auto function is sufficient assuming the hookup is higher quality than just AV cables and an interlaced source.  If you use a TV, or AV cable hookup, don't expect miracles.  I haven't hooked up a computer or an HDTV tuner yet, but I'm sure they will be great based on what I've seen so far.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.

$REVIEW.: When you spend a good deal of money on your iPad you want a case that is protective enough with enough features to make it worthy of your device
 This Belkin Storage Folio is priced on the higher end of most iPad holders, but has some basic, decent qualities


 Although it looks somewhat cheap, the nylon is robust enough for everyday use

 Magnetic sensors make sure that your iPad is on or off whenever you  open to close the cover, which is nice and the cover snaps securely


 The inside back of the folio is made of velvet microfiber to protect the iPad


 The front contains a pocket which can be used for accessories, but it is a little small for something like the power cable

 It is nice that you can stand the folio upright at almost an 80-degree angle and watch videos, plus it has a perfect hole cut-out for the camera lens
 I suspect with all the competition that iPad folios will improve in quality and extras, so this is up there with the better ones for now
 Stay posted.

$REVIEW.: This case is fantastic. Custom made for Nexus 7 (I have the 2013 version) with all the right cutouts. Great protection against drops (so long as you have it closed when you drop it). My nexus 7 automatically turns on when I open the case so it senses the opening of the cover. You can use this so many ways:&#62;&#62; If you open case and fold it onto back of nexus 7, there is a strap you can use to hold it in this position (small black strap has to be placed over the two corners of the device and over the clasp (sounds complicated but after the first time it is easy). Once it is help open, there is a hand strap on the case that  you can slip your fingers through. This allows you to watch video while you are walking or while there is no flat surface but without requiring you to grasp the device for hours on end. Very important feature. I use this a lot on airplanes when my tray table needs to be up (or even during flight because my tray table is usually too far from my eyes for this size screen).&#62;&#62; You can unhinge the two bottom corners of the Nexus 7 from the case by popping them off (be careful you pop them off so it doesn't pull the nexus 7 apart . . . case is very strong). After you free the bottom two corners, you can set the case on a flat surface with almost any viewing angle hands free!Case is very attractive and the finish holds pretty well. The corners get frayed but this is to be expected. Case has a small fabric loop for inserting a stylus (I don't use this).I give this my highest rating with no hesitation after 2 months of heavy use.
$SUMMARY.: The IDEAL case for a Nexus 7 (2013) user who travels

$review_text.: I was looking for a Bluetooth keyboard with a touch pad to replace the keyboard that came with my media center PC...  but the Adesso seems a much better solution.Ergonomically, it's nicely designed with the trackball in the upper right hand corner and all the mouse buttons on the right and left corners just where you would expect them to be, and the size is just right also; smaller than a regular keyboard but a nice form factor so it works nicely if you're sitting or lying around on the couch.Not a five star product only because the pointer skips just a little here and there with the trackball... but this is still a great solution.
$SUMMARY.: excellent solution for home theater / PC

$REVIEW.: This is the second large-print keyboard I have purchased. I have bought two of this same keyboard, assuming that the problems faced with the first were a manufacturing error. However, I have had problems with both. Initial quality is good, but after a few months of use the print began to come off of the first keyboard and some keys began to stick, making them hard to depress. On this second keyboard, the ink is sticking better to the keys, but some of the larger keys (tab, shift, enter) are again beginning to exhibit the sticking that required a replacement of the first keyboard. The idea behind this is great for someone with limited vision, but the implementation leaves room for improvement.The included software provides some useful features, but doesn't allow for an eject key, which is essential on a Mac keyboard. I've tried several workarounds, but none have worked, so I have been caused to leave a disc in the CD drive so that I can use the eject keyboard shortcut or menu option to change out discs.Unfortunately, I haven't found a better option yet; so I may end up with another of this same keyboard in a month or two when this one gives out.
$SUMMARY.: Sticky keys, slick ink

$review_text.: I use this adapter to get sound through headphones when using my PlayStation 3. It works extremely well and luckily the volume comes out perfectly so I don't even need to adjust in-game settings. I also plug 2.0 PC speakers into this adapter at the same time. I can even get sound out of both the speakers and the headphones at the same time but they output lesser volumes. Overall, this product is great for the price because buying an RCA-3.5 mm adapter and a stereo coupler would come out to twice the price, twice the adapters, and only on stereo jack.As far as surround sound, this obviously isn't going to be the most amazing product ever seeing as how it's just dual channel sound but if you use it like I do, you will be extremely satisfied.

$REVIEW.: I opened the kit and was quite impressed with the quality of the flash heads for their compact size. They fire well and the modelling light is nice. The softboxes must be manually assembled with 4 rods connecting into tiny pockets in each corner of the softboxes... They are good quality but I with they were pop-up as they require several minutes to setup. I do a lot of traveling photo work and they are a waste of time to assemble. The stands are very cheap and they wobble around at the slightest wind. I will be replacing the stands as even with sandbags they wont stay still when assembled and raised even a short distance. In retrospect, if I had bought all the items separately I would have been much more satisfied.

$REVIEW.: This would be a decent camera if it included a reasonable viewfinder.  All it has is the LCD screen which can be very difficult to see when using the camera outdoors on a sunny day.  I partially solved this problem with a separate shoe-mounted finder.  However the accessory finder and evidently any other shoe-mounted device has to be removed to use the internal flash.This camera's claim to fame is that it will accept any lens with a Pentax K mount.  However, when using any Pentax camera, beware of some of the lenses made for Ricoh as some of these have a stuck pin problem that can make the lens very difficult if not impossible to remove.  The claim that all K mount lenses will fit this camera is meaningless because there is no way to accurately focus manual focus lenses.  The peaking feature was suppose to allow the user to manually focus lenses but this feature is so imprecise as to be useless when doing critical work with a shallow depth of field. With peaking, in-focus elements show up as silvery glittering picture elements in the LCD.  I made a series of test shots with a 80-200mm Tokina manual focus lens. Coming from both directions, from far and from close, I would focus until the peaking just appeared in the LCD on my focus target.  Every exposure made in such a manner was out of focus.  If, with a continual focus, I noted when the peaking appeared and when peaking disappeared and tried to focus near the middle of the range, I would get satisfactory focus about 1/3 of the time.  I read one professional review done shortly after the camera was available in which the reviewer claimed that their were also problems with the auto focus.  However I updated the firmware from version 1.00 to 1.01 and now the auto focus seems generally satisfactory.  There is a menu choice on the camera which will show the firmware version.  Any of these cameras still using the original 1.00 firmware should be updated.Another potential problem is with the USB-HDMI-memory card cover.  It is secured to the camera body with a flimsy rubber hinge that does not inspire confidence.Other than the above problems, the camera seems to work well.  Considering the onboard APS-C sensor, the camera is a real steal at the less than $400 body-only price tag, even with the finder problems.
$SUMMARY.: crippled by viewing system

$REVIEW.: Out of the box, it was so simple to set up.  I was watching a movie in about 30 minutes, and after about a day, feel fairly comfortable with the remote and jumping between functions.  A lighted remote would have been nice considering this is intended for a home theater system.  The buttons are quite small, but at least the important buttons such as volume and hdmi1-hdmi5 are easily accessed.  The other buttons such as pause, fast forward etc are smaller but typically used when there is adequate lighting.  If you are planning to use this in the dark, the remote could be a deal breaker. Not to knock my prior system (denon AVR-1913), but this one blows that one out of the water with regard to ease of operation and quality of sound.

Noticed light bleed on the right side of the screen, which I was almost OK with. Shortly after starting to use it, I either noticed a dead pixel or it died. Either way, wasn't too happy at that point.Plus:- Win 8 works well on tablet- Pretty- Lightweight- Keyboard dock works well- 2 batteries- Sound/speakers were adequate for our needsMinus:- Poor screen quality makes me lose faith in the rest of the HW & screen :(. You'll notice my experience wasn't an isolated incident either...** Update 6/21:We've requested a replacement from the retailer which will be available in a few days. This little piece of hardware is really nice. I also have not seen any other reviews indicating display defects like the one we saw (dead/stuck pixel). Yes, I know there's an "accepted industry minimum", but I don't care--don't want any on hardware at this price.** Update 7/14:We had a problem with the network dropping connection when resuming from sleep and had to manually reset it. I upgraded the network drivers which didn't help. I didn't see any change notes from the SBIOS which would address this. We ended up returning it. Has great potential, but just not there yet.

Yes, it does put some weight on the tablet but I love how it keeps my iDevice protected.My gripe is the screen cover it is hard to put on & take off. And it's not fully sealed. I have opened my case couple of times already because I had to clean the screen inside, a piece of lint got inside the screen. Yes, the screen proctor latches are snapped shut, I made sure of that. But somehow lint got in there. I like how my older case was made, the screen protective cover is inside the rubber case.  This one it's on top & there is a gap between the screen & the protective cover. I had to get used to that in the beginning because it made the screen not very touch sensitive.

Plus I found myself sitting uncomfortably in order to get a good view of my monitors.  So I got two of these and they work great!  Much cheaper than alternatives, too.  I found several products on Amazon at various price points that look identical.These are very solid/sturdy, and come with extra hardware to fit most monitors I would think.  This includes thick spacers if your VESA mount is recessed.  It comes with a neat little bubble level, which was a bad idea since I can't ever seem to get it perfectly level but I don't care.  My two monitors are flush after some minor tweaks (a few sticky notes under one side of one of the mount brackets.  In that regard, expect to have to work with them a bit to get them the way you like them if you are picky like me.  The hardware isn't all that user friendly, but after tweaking it to get it mounted just right you shouldn't ever have to mess with it.  I recommend using some kind of cheater bar to help you tighten the bracket screw down firmly.I put a couple of 1x2 wooden blocks on my desk to get the right thickness and raise them up a bit.  Plenty of height, except one of my monitors has the VESA mount near the top...stupid.  I thought that I may wish these were taller, but now that I can move my monitors much closer I don't really need any more height.  I am much more comfortable with my monitors closer to me, can see them better, and have more desk space under them to work with.  3 thumbs up! =)

$review_text.: I bought this unit nearly 2 months ago, and I'm pretty happy with it, because it has delivered on the promise that Tom-Tom made: a great bundle of features for a small price.  I don't get to update my map to the latest version because it's too big.  But that's no big deal.  I think the map in the unit is pretty well up-to-date anyway, and the ability to update within 30 days of purchase is of minimal value.  Now if I could update any time within a year...  But of course, that's just wishful thinking.There is one thing I want to tell people about, which you can easily get over, but you really need to know about it to make the unit work correctly.  To operate effectively, the unit needs to be able to quickly lock in the available GPS satellites.  It does so by having a current map of where these satellites are presently located.  Without a current map, the unit will take several minutes to scan the sky and find them by itself.  You need to have a current satellite map, which means that you have to plug in your unit via the USB port and connect to the Tom Tom HOME program and select update about once a week.  Doing so should keep your satellite map current.  If you don't do that, the unit will report these satellites as "lost" for several minutes, and if you need to recalculate your route on the fly, you will be out of luck.But all may not go smoothly.  Sometimes, the update will not upload the current satellite map as it should.  But there is a way to force an upload. In the HOME program, go to the "remove items" selection and having clicked that, click the "items on computer" tab. There you may find one or more items labeled "QuickGPSfix Data". Click on the box to the right, in order to remove any and all instances of this item.  These files will be removed from your computer.  Then go back and update your unit again via Tom-Tom HOME and you might find a new "QuickGPSfix" item waiting. Apparently, the updater doesn't like to see old instances of this file on your hard disk.  It's quite a nuisance, and I have to do it all the time, but if you go through this procedure you will be regularly updated to the current satellite map.Bottom line: The Tom-Tom Company is a real clunk because of these glitches, but if you can get by the speed bumps in the unit, it's a very satisfactory product.

$REVIEW.: I got the D3000-D5000 DSLR starter kit at a fairly reduced price, so can't complain too much, but I probably wouldn't bother with getting it if I could do it all over
 I bought it primarily for the bag, and even though it seems to be made decently, it's horribly sized

 It's way too small if you want to tote a second lens with you (which is kind of the point of using an SLR, right?), and if all you are going to do is haul the camera body with the 28-55 basic lens, it's actually kind of too big and cumbersome


 The DVD might have been useful to review the camera's functions and features, but the copy I received was authored on such poor media that it skipped and was unplayable in every DVD player I have

 It's also a pretty sparse starter "kit" -- Nikon could have thrown in a few other cheap but helpful accessories like lens cleaning tools or a UV filter to make this a more attractive buy

 Even at a good price, there's not really enough here to make this decent value.


$SUMMARY.: I wouldn't bother...

$REVIEW.: I've owned wireless mice in the past and have had... varying degrees of satisfaction.  Suffice to say this one stands out as the coolest one I've used so far for one simple reason: how compact it is.The mouse is battery powered (two AA batteries, included), like most wireless mice. While some are capable of being smaller, this one is a very nice size.  I'd say it's slightly smaller than a standard wired mouse, but not noticeably so when it is in your hand. It's comfortable yet light, but doesn't feel cheap.The biggest perk relative to other, non-bluetooth wireless mice that I've used is that the computer connection (USB) is about as long as the insert into the slot and that's it.  I uploaded a picture to the product page, you can check it out to see the size... it really is as small as it looks in the default picture.  Once plugged in, it's very difficult to even notice it's there.  The range is very impressive... I've tested up to 10 feet away and couldn't even notice any interference with the smoothness of the mouse tracking.So far for surfaces, I've tried it on the hardwood surface of a desk, a mousepad, and my computer case (not really sure what the exact material is); all of them work perfectly.  It comes with software that can be installed to adjust sensitivity, although the mouse works fine without the software (just plug it in, let your computer install the drivers, and in 5 seconds you're operational).All in all, I'm extremely satisfied with this mouse.  Given the range, the size, and especially the price (I bought it for $11, I'd pay up to $15 for it), I would definitely buy this mouse again.

$review_text.: The other reviews have hit it right on and I'm not sure I can add anything more, but I'll give it a shot.This computer is amazing.  Not only is it a sleek and sexy machine, but wow is it powerful!  I upgraded from an older Macbook mainly because I wanted a Mac with a powerful video card for video editing, photo editing and even some gaming.  So far this computer has handled everything I've thrown at it.  It's fast, quiet and takes the imac to the next level.  I was going back and forth between this and the cheaper versions and even the smaller screen.  I'm glad I made the choice I did and got the 27".  After spending a few hours on the computer, looking at my Samsung 1080p looks the way standard definition did after you first saw HD!  The clarity of the ultra high resolution monitor is by far the best looking screen on the market.  I finally decided if you are going to spend the money, go for the best.  Sure there is one model higher that can be purchased directly from Apple, but as usual Amazon delivered on the best price out there!  For all the Mac haters out there that question the premium price Apple charges, there is a reason they can command the $$$ they do.  They are powerful machines and works of art.  No Windows based machine has the same lines as these beautiful machines.  Apple has by far the best designers and engineers in the world.The computer is much heavier than I expected, mainly because the aluminum case is solid.  The great part is even though it is a heavy computer, it tilts with the push of a finger and stays exactly where you moved it.  I've read complaints that this computer doesn't come in a matte screen.  Sure the glossy screen does cause reflections in bright light, but so far I think the reflections are worth the trade off for the absolute dazzle the glossy screen provides.Immediately on its arrival I upgraded the RAM to 16 gigs.  It's as easy as removing 3 screws, popping out the old memory and filling all 4 slots with 4 gigs of DDR3 1333 mhz RAM.The only negatives I can even list are that the computer runs hot.  I did buy an app to monitor the temps and so far it's in line with my macbook.  I think it just seems hotter because the aluminum disperses the heat through the top of the computer.  When you touch the top of the computer you are amazed at the heat coming out.  I also wish Apple supplied this computer with a wireless keyboard with the number pad.  They do sell the corded version with the number pad, but I really wanted to stay wireless.  I do miss the number pad, I'm not going to lie.  Entering passwords is weird using the numbers on the regular keyboard!  At some point I hope they offer a wireless keyboard with the number pad.  The sound is also not overly amazing but I always use external speakers anyway so it's not a problem.  It's a step up from the sound out of a macbook for sure, but it is aimed downward and not at you.  The bass is decent though for built in sound if you don't want to add 2.1 speakers.I can't end my review on a negative note though. The built in isight camera in HD is an awesome touch.  I can't believe the quality of the camera to be honest.  I look at myself on the screen and every imperfection of my face is captured.  Do I really look that old!I expect this computer to last me the next 5 years and I'm sure it will have no problem doing just that!  I can't wait to see what accessories the Thunderbolt ports wind up supporting.  I'd love to run and additional 2 27" screens at the same resolution using the ports eventually.  Apple is usually way ahead of the curve so I have no doubt it is a technology that will catch on and will be amazing!  There are many manufactures with products in the pipeline that will support Thunderbolt so I hope to see stuff hitting the market in the next few months.You only live once, and life is short.  You deserve the best, and this machine will not disappoint!!Update:  I upgraded to the same memory that JFLY referenced in his post.  It was cheap, it is fast, and I have no complaints at all about it!  Better than paying Apple $600 for a 16 gig memory upgrade!  Also I can't wait to see what this computer will do with the newest version of OS X being released in July!  No one really has mentioned that this computer is truly a 64 bit machine.  I've installed windows 7 64 bit and I am amazed at how it also runs on this computer.  XP on my older macbook was never 100%.  It was good, it just never seemed natural.  Windows 7 on this machine running in bootcamp is amazing.

You CAN boot from the 6G SATA port into WIN7x64.2

You CAN clone your OS onto the SSD.3
If you want to upgrade the firmware, switch to AHCI.4
After OS installation, between reboots, I tried the ALL the SATA ports as IDE, AHCI, and RAID

The fastest performance I got was in the RAID mode (single SSD)


Fastest controller was Marvell
I've included the RAID benchmark with this review
Everyone else is going to tell you NOT to use Marvell-I'm here to tell you I actually got the best performance with it.ATTO Disk Benchmark:418 MBS sequential read (max)230 MBS sequential write (max)The above is really this drive's maximum throughput, which pretty much corresponds with Crucial's specs
Depending on your computer's usage, you will NOT get these numbers throughout typical usage.

 I paired this with a PC I built with a blu-ray player and Asus motherboard and it recognized my 3D Sony KDL50W800B tv!  Also, this is PERFECT for gaming!!!  I have a PC gaming rig I built (GTX 780TI, Core i7 4770K), PS4, PS3, Xbox One, 360, etc


 The picture is fantastic with my PC and consoles

 It feels like looking through a window

I've read some of the reviews on here about color and how bad it is
 I say, those people need to go have their eyes checked!!!!  This TV is Amazing

 I was a bit skeptical at first

 I saw this on base (I'm in the AIr Force) and I had to get it
Electronic stores always have sufficient ambient lighting when viewing LED TVs
 I was skeptical about getting it home and watching it in the dark (how sometimes you get the LED backlit dark spots in the corners of the TV)

 I took this one home and NO ISSUES WITH DARK SPOTS!!! The sound is &#34;okay&#34; at best

 I am going to pick up a Sony wireless sound system

It has numerous features
 Also, for all you fellow gamers out there, this TV will be getting Sony's Playstation Now

 An app that allows you to stream PS3, PS4, PS2, PS1, PS Vita, etc games straight to your TV


 Should be out this summer (You won't even need a console with this TV!!!!)  GREAT GREAT GREAT  it is just one you have to see for yourself.

Be forwarned, the customer must pay the shipping cost
Also, DVDs recorded from the tuner or cable box won't even play on my other Samsung DVD player

The instructions state that recorded DVDs may not play on all makes

But not even on one of their own players? Fortunately, copies made from my VCR tapes and camcorder work just fine on the other player


I wish I had known about these problems before making the purchase.

$review_text.: This little speaker provides amazing sound considering its modest size. I'm very impressed although I can't offer detailed comparisons like some other reviewers. The built-in audio cord for 3.5 mm jack is a little on the flimsy side. I have a couple of extra audio cables so wouldn't have minded if it just had a jack and I could use my own cable. In case this is helpful to others, the speaker synced easily with my iPhone 5 and my Kindle Fire HD, however, my iPod Touch 2nd gen wasn't able to recognize it.
$SUMMARY.: Great sound from a small package

$review_text.: Every night, I listen to a CD (Holosync by Centerpointe) while going to sleep


 The CD has a range of frequencies, from deep bass (down to as low as 20 Hz) to mid-range

 Also, since I travel frequently, the headphones need to be sturdy.When my previous headphones (by Sennheiser) died, I purchased these to use for the CD instead.From an audio quality standpoint, with my old Sennheiser headphones, I could hear some subtle nuances in the audio, at slightly lower volume, than I can with these headphones


 Then again, the Sennheiser headphones cost $250, while these cost $70.However, my Sony headphones serve me very well
 They produce good (but not great) sound, so I can clearly hear the bass and mid-range without turning up the volume

 Because the ear cups are soft and comfortable, the top is padded, and the headphones themselves are lightweight, I can easily fall sleep with the headphones on.The coiled cord is extremely handy, keeping the headphones from becoming too tangled.Beyond that, the headphones themselves are sturdy, standing up to a year of being put in a squished suitcase without a scratch


 Also, they are very affordable (about $70 from Amazon.com).The only issue is, if I wanted headphones to use while working out, these headphones wouldn't do because the padding would likely absorb my sweat

 However, for my non-workout needs, these are excellent.Although the audio isn't quite professional quality, these are an excellent set of headphones for the money.

$review_text.: ...that give you much more than you spent
The optical quality seems to be on par with any of the more expensive brands

The distortion characteristics are top notch, and though straight lines bend, your human subjects appear less distorted and you get a very usable image

Aperture of 3.5 means you can use it indoors, and with the 8mm focal length shutter speeds of 1/15 is all you need for a sharp shot with a steady hand.On the D7000 simply put in the max aperture on the "non cpu lens" data screen in the menu, and then it will meter and record the exif correctly

At f/5.6 set the focus to 3M and everything from ~1.5-infinity will generally be in focus
If autofocus was only $100 more I would not pay for it--simply not needed since the effort is so minimal.The sharpness is great, and the CA is very low for a fisheye
Check out the photozone review of the lens; the way it distorts is great


The shots tend to really stand out as they are not only interesting, but also very pleasing.

$REVIEW.: I have the same problem an earlier poster had, bad video coloring in HD.  It's especially notable on faces.  I have 2 other HD tv's, Vizio 720p and Sony 1080p, and get my video from DishNetwork in HD.  Neither of these other tv's have this problem and they all share the same video feed (HDMI connection from DishNetwork ViP722).I'm fairly versed in TV tech so I went thru the video settings and tried to tweak them to get rid of the 'cartoonish' look, but I couldn't find an acceptable setting.  I reset everything to the default settings and it was still there.I did a lot of research before finally buying this set at Walmart for $400 (price match against a sale unit at Target) and almost all reviewers praised its picture quality.  I was very surprised and disappointed to find the image quality so poor.  I will return it to Walmart and pick up a Vizio instead.

$REVIEW.: I'm on a continuous quest to find a set of headphones for running that stay in my ears

 The standard ear pods don't work for me, and all the over the ear phones I've tried- while they don't necessarily fall off, they do dangle in front of the ear canal a bit- which affects sound quality


 Ones that go directly into the ear canal are uncomfortable and since I jog on the road a lot..

dangerous as they block out the sound of oncoming traffic.I have about 200 miles of jogging on these earphones
 About 3-1/2 months.1
 Fit:  I've tried various combinations of the little green pads that come with it, but they don't really stay in all that well for me
 Every mile or so I am re-twisting them back into my ear

 Overall, however, I haven't found an earphone that stays in even close to this well
 So- 4-stars in this regard
 They fit/stay in better than any other I've tried


 But- still not perfect.2


 Sound quality:  Good

 Not great, but good
 Terrific sound for $30 earphones- but they aren't competing with the Bose or other $100+ units
 The base isn't filled out but it is decent, the upper mid-range isn't as clear as it could be

 But- they sound a step better than, let's say, the stock earphones that come with the ipod


 So, as long as you're not an audiophile, you'll probably enjoy the sound quality
 I do


 I give them another 4-stars here


 Maybe 5 given the (very low) price.3


 Reliability

 After not quite 4 months of regular use, one of the earphones has begun to buzz


 i.e


like a broken speaker
 So, at least in my case, I'm now looking for my next pair to try for running

 2-stars.4

 The worst part:  The green wire
 No, I don't have a problem with the bright color (who cares?), it has other issues

 The overall length is good, but the green wire retains the original coil shape that it came with- so it's constantly getting tangled on itself

 Secondly, the right earbud is much much longer than the left..

and it doesn't have a slider to keep the two together when not in use

 So, firstly, they always wrap around each other and get tangled, secondly; one of the wires is way too long and dangles and knocks on itself (which you can hear) when you're running

 Really awful design

 It does come with a clip, that must be attached to the shirt (don't lose it) off to one side, and with some creativity (wrapping the long side behind my head) I have gotten the whole unequal length thing to work

 2-stars here.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this to help control an inverter that I was installing in my travel trailer. The inverter and switch needed to go into the same compartment that housed the breaker/fuse panel and converter. The panel can be accessed (with difficulty) by removing 4 screws. I did not pay attention to the dimensions of the switch and this could have been a big mistake. The switch is not a solid-state device (as I had irrationally assumed) but an electrical contactor with some relays. Fortunately for me, I was able to wedge it into position and had just enough room for the install. The switch did not come with any instructions but there is a diagram inside the cover. The cover comes off fairly easy, but if you do not notice the instructions on how to remove it (moulded into the cover) you will really struggle like I did for a while. I hooked up the wiring as indicated, connecting the inverter to leads identified for a generator. This was a mistake. This switch (basically a normal seeking auto bus transfer switch) defaults to the generator connections. Fortunately, one of the reviews on Amazon gave the web site for a manual for the switch. I downloaded the PDF and it gave several wiring scenarios, including mine. I then went back into the enclosure and switched my shore power leads with my inverter leads. Now, when shore power is restored, the switch automatically returns to shore power as the source.Interestingly, If you are switching three sources, the manual shows using two switches together and how to hook them up to prioritize your sources.I also purchased a switch to remotely turn the inverter on and off (JR Products 12005 White Single SPST On-Off Switch with Bezel). I found it to be pretty easy to connect the switch in parallel with the inverter's power switch using control wire that I ran through a cooling vent in the inverter. Now if I am boondocking or loose campground power, all I have to do is open the breaker for the converter, AC and other loads that I do not want to power, then turn on my inverter. After a short time delay, the inverter comes on line and is powering my entire trailer, making it easy for me to pick and choose which 120v items I want to use.

$review_text.: When I saw the price of the Venture HC, I was in shock

$114.99 for one of the best gps units on the market today, is unheard of


This little yellow wonder can receive location signals even in dense forest, and in the deepest of canyons.I bought one even though I own the Legend HC and Legend C


The reason....I'm in charge of a survey crew who's  job is to recover survey markers, or as they are properly called, section and quarter section monuments


Some of the areas I and my crew look for these points are in the Wasatch mountain range just east of Salt Lake City, and the Oquirrh Mountains to the west

These mountains are very rugged and easy to lose  your direction
We upload the latitude and longitudes into the Garmin Venture HC and Legend HC and search the mountain sides

So far we have recovered most of the survey points we are looking for, thanks to our Garmin units
Without our handheld units it would take us a lot longer.I cant say enough about Garmins quality, and the support is unsurpassed.If your thinking about buying a gps unit heres a test you can do
Call Magellan's support line

What do you get?.......people who can hardy talk English

$review_text.: I bought this for my iPad 2 because I did not want to use a case, but still wanted some form of protection.  I love the slim profile the iPad has, so I didn't want to take it away.  Obviously this wouldn't protect from big drops, but if you drop your $500 devices a lot, then maybe you should buy an Otterbox.This protects well against:- Scratches- Wear- DirtI have it on with a smart cover and no problems at all.  Everything fits great.  I also have a slip case I put my iPad in when I am traveling.Installation:The wet install is weird if you have never done it before, but pretty simple.  Take your time!  Plan 30 minutes and really go slow just so everything is perfect.  It fit very well, just had the edges not staying down at first.  As I kept pressing over with the rubber tool it came with, all the edges stayed down.  It just takes some pressure and time.  Just keep pressing out the air and go over the edges a lot.I have had this on my iPad for over 6 months of normal use and no edge has peeled up or anything!  If you do it right the first time and be patient then this is perfect.  A little bit of dirt around the edges, but everything is pretty much the same as it was when I installed it.These are a bit pricey, but if I ever get a different iPad I would buy this again.  It works if you don't drop or treat your iPad rough.

If it cost more like the current prices I'm seeing I would probably return it.I decided to keep this, a logitech BT boom box and a monster clarityHD for $49 more than what I paid for one Bose sound link on sale.This gives both my wife and I full size BT speakers for our iPads and me a very portable speaker to take on my motorcycle trips with out having to worry about a high priced item getting broken.To me the Bose sounded muddy on some music and the supertooth and logitech both have a more rewarding "full" range sound on more types of music.I'm not trashing Bose as I also own 3 of their headphones and 2 of their other theater systems - I just felt that this was the best sound choice for the situation.

$review_text.: I have gone through several headphones in my search for the perfect pair.  I tried mid range versions with moderate price tags with mixed results.  I would get adequate headphones but always drooled over these in electronic magazines.  I wanted to get them but the price held me back until it was pointed out that in my continued search, I had spent a pretty penny.  I saved up and finally got this pair and I wish I had done it a lot sooner - they are perfection!Other reviews can provide more scientific data on why they are so great so I will stick to the pure enjoyment of using this P5 mobile headphones.  First, the sound they deliver is magical.  I love the plush cushion for your ears as opposed to the cushioned ring headphones; I think this provides better sound and they are more comfortable long term.  Also love that there are no distortion no what what type of music or volume setting is played.  Another big plus is that they are super comfortable and can be worn for hours and remain comfortable.  All together with the mobile feature makes these headphones the best ever!The price tag gave me pause but after getting them, I really wish I had just bought them from the beginning instead of waiting years and ending up spending more money in the long run for inferior headphones.  Spending more money does not always equal getting more but these headphones are worth every cent.

$review_text.: I love/hate this keyboard. It's so comfortable, and changed my life. I'm addicted to it (and freaking out now that my SECOND one, too, is broken, and the product is discontinued). I need it and can't use other brands because they're either not travel-sized and thus too huge for my little hands, or they go TOO far with being travel-sized (they're super-tiny, not really meant for daily use, more for phones than a laptop).I am dependent on it now but it's s***ty. Like everyone's saying, the LEFT side goes wonky (keys stop working or, in my case now, they type crazy gibberish). And, at $100-120 a pop, I can't keep blowing my money on new ones.You all should also note that this is DISCONTINUED, possibly because it was so crappy. I see that they have a new version but am appalled to see that they seem to have built it unergonomically (it's higher up in the back, which is god-awful for one's wrists but a feature/style that the ignorant expect and love), which makes me distrust the company a bit now... The good news is that they appear to have moved the alt key to a less painful location for people who do alt+tab a lot.I am going to call the company and argue that this is the second one in a row where the left side went wonky (and I did not spill ANYTHING on it, I swear) and see what they can do for me, if anything.

$REVIEW.: College student here and have been using this bookbag for almost a month now. I originally have been using nothing but Jansport bookbags my entire lifetime. After going through about 10 of them, I decided to switch it up. I usually carry my laptop, charger, calculator, pens and pencils, a book or two, two water bottles, and other misc. items everyday to class.Pros:- The material is great. Feel very durable and feels like it will last me a while.- The ergonomics on the straps and back padding are great.- Padding all around the book bag safely secures my items.- Good amount of pockets and features (key holder, sun/glasses holder, water bottle pokets, etc..)Cons:- My 15.6" laptop is a tight fit.- It's pretty small. I only could fit my laptop, binder and maybe a book or two.- There are pockets for the laptop charger to be placed, but they would be pushed against my books, so I have to place them in a different front pocket.- One of the side pockets for the water bottles seems to be a little smaller, sometimes my water bottle falls out of it.Overall I would highly recommend this product. I feel as if I will be using this book bag for years to come.

$review_text.: I bought the APC H15 locally because a recent power surge during a storm in my area seems to have blown out a lot of my electronics
 The H15 is very easy to setup as all the inputs are labeled well and makes it easy to figure out which products "should" be attached to each outlet

 I say "should" because I hear these are merely suggestions

 Of course some of them are more important than others with filtering/etc so be smart about where you plug in your gear and make sure at the very least to plug in your receiver to the receiver input and TV to TV..

basically connect as much as possible to an outlet that matches up
 If you have a device that doesn't match one of the outlets, it should be fine as I've used several of the outlets for various uses where my product didn't match an outlet name like my slingbox is connected to an AMP line/etc...Anyway, the MAIN problem I had with this product is that the COAX connections are a little tricky on this device


 There is a bank of outlets labeled CATV / Modem, which you would expect to be for cable tv and cable modems while there is another outlet labled SAT / Antenna presumably for satellite tv.When I first got the H15, I plugged in one coax to the CATV / Modem input and outputted to my tivo and cable modem thinking that was all I needed to do
 Well after hooking it up, I got extreme pixelation on my tivo and many channels froze up and were unusable
 I disconnected the coax and went straight to my tivo and cable modem while I contacted APC support


 Their response was that they thought that the signal coming in to my home must be bad and that I should try using an signal booster.Not wanting to go out and buy another device, I decided to try something...
 I connected my tivo to the SAT / Antenna input/output and the cable modem to the CATV / Modem input/output to see if that would make a difference.Voila!  The tivo is now working with no problems!  My cable modem while connected to the CATV / Modem input/output saw some signal loss (as I'd expect since it's a split coax line in the H15) but not significant enough to make a difference as far as I can tell

Average power level on my modem went from -4 to -5 db to -8 to -9 db, all of which I hear are within acceptable levels for Comcast in my area


 The only major difference I can see on the admin page on my cable modem is that instead of showing all 8 channels in the downstream bonding channel value section I'm only seeing channels 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8


 Upstream remained the same with only 4, 5, and 6 showing up as channels.Either way, I did speed tests and got the same speeds whether I was directly attached or passing through the H15


 If anyone knows if not showing all 8 channels is an issue, let me know

Otherwise, I suggest that any of you that have this issue to try out connecting your cable tv box through the SAT connection and your cable box through the CATV connection.Hope this helps other people that have had issues with the coax connections on the H15!!UPDATE 9/26/2013--------------------------------I started noticing that my cable modem was losing connection every few hours, most likely because it was connected through the CATV coax connections that are split on the H15


 The split connection undoubtedly will cause a signal loss on the output


 Therefore, I removed the coax cables from the H15 and put the coax on another Panamax power conditioner which I happened to have in my AV Closet
 Using the Panamax (which does not have a splitter) I get about -3 to -4 db power according to the cable modem, ALL channels are showing again on the cable modem admin page and so far I have had no disconnects according to the logs.I considered taking the H15 back and getting aPanamax M5300-PM 11 Outlet Clean Power Level 4 - Blackbut I will most likely end up keeping the H15 and using another means of power protection for the cable modem since the H15 has voltage regulation and the M5300-PM does not

 Also the H15 is still much cheaper than the M5300
 From my hands-on experience at the store, the H15 also seems more heavy duty than the M5300-PM, which is probably due to the extra components inside for the voltage regulation.I removed a star from my initial review of 5 stars because of the issue I had with the coax


 APC really should remove the coax splitter from the box and just add another bank of coax connections to give a total of 3 pass through coax connections rather than 1 pass through and 1 split connection.



$SUMMARY.: Great Product - After a few adjustments on coax connections!

$review_text.: I got this keyboard to use with my laptop when it's attached to the TV in my living room.  For that purpose, this is a great device.  I can leave my laptop next to the TV, close the lid, and do everything I would otherwise do on the small laptop screen on my massive TV.  Sometimes there's lag issues between swiping my finger on the track pad and the mouse pointer moving on the screen, but I think it's object interference between the keyboard and the USB receiver.  Definitely great for streaming stuff on the TV through your laptop so you don't have to get up off your butt to pause, play, or choose the next episode.  I used this method for streaming Netflix before I got Xbox Live Gold.  They keyboard feels kind of cheaply made and the right shift button is tiny, but it works well enough for how I use it.  Overall it's a good piece to have.

$review_text.: BackBlaze recently compared their server records on Hitachi, WD and Seagate. Hitachi beat out WD as the most reliable drive by a small but significant margin. Hitachi is also fast, though I don't have figures. Their quality control is still considered good in an industry prone to outsourcing its manufacturing. Seagate trailed a distant third in reliability.I researched before buying. I bought and installed four of these 2TB units in a single RAID 10 configuration, last month, through Amazon.  The drives run 24/7 and are constantly accessed by me and a file synch program. For my money they're as silent as any others I have used in Mac or PC installations, barely audible 2' away on my work desk. This RAID is really fast. I read the comments about head repositioning noise. It is a slightly noticeable curiosity I would't have identified without these reviews. I hear it only once in a while, but I don't find it distracting or objectionable.However this supplier is not Prime, and the time lag between order and delivery dates is of some concern. I ordered two more on Saturday and they still show as &#34;Preparing for Shipment&#34; Monday night. I may order bare drives from NewEgg when I need them to complete a project.

$REVIEW.: I have owned a Dayton Audio DTA-100 (the original version) for a year now and, just two days ago, I received thisDayton Audio DTA-100a Class-T Digital Amplifier 50 WPC, the upgraded version.I am as pleased as is possible with both of them. The sound quality produced by these amplifiers is nothing short of amazing.Both versions use the Tripath TK2050 chipset which offers extremely - and I mean extremely - clean and neutral sound (at its true high fidelity rating of 30 W/Channel) plus very high electrical efficiency (> 85% claimed). It is as 'green' as it comes.I had written to Parts Express asking them to tell me the difference between the -100 and the -100a; their technician's reply was that the new -100a has an improved headphone amplifier circuit; nothing else has been changed. I wouldn't know about this - I do not often listen to music through headphones and I have never tried using headphones with either of these amplifiers.Via loudspeakers, the sound produced is the same with both models. And, as stated, it's just great!I have read where 30 W/channel is "not enough" power. I disagree with that statement; how "loud" music sounds is a function of the sound amplifier power, true to some extent, but it is much MORE a function of the efficiency of the speakers used in conjunction with that amplifier.Connect a pair of Klipschorns (sensitivity of 105 db/1W/1M - the most efficient speakers ever made - I own a pair) to a 30 W/channel amplifier and that system could "blow you out of the room" (maybe out of your house - maybe even off your block!). If you are interested in this amp, you'll want to check speaker sensitivity prior to purchasing the speakers. A speaker of 88 dB/1W/1M would be more than adequate to be used with this amplifier in any 'normal' room. A speaker of > 92 dB/1W/1M would be perfect for even very large rooms.According to the manufacturer, this amplifier should NOT be used with 4 Ohm (impedance) speakers; 6 Ohm is the minimum impedance rating acceptable. Fortunately, most speakers today are of 8 Ohm rating and are therefore perfectly acceptable. (Note that impedance varies with frequency but if a manufacturer rates his speakers at 8 Ohms, it is safe to assume that the rating is correct.)I can tell you that, using this amplifier with theDayton Audio B652 6-1/2 2-Way Bookshelf Speaker Pair(sensitivity 87 db/1W/1M), you would have a SUPERB sound system for use in an average size room. NO ONE would ever have to apologize for it.And the whole thing is portable!I have been using both the -100 and now the -100a with those speakers along with thisStanton S.300 Tabletop CD Player with MP3 Compatibility(it's small enough to be portable too) and the sound quality produced from this system is nothing short of superb.This little amplifier would actually fit into a pocket (though the 'power brick' would take another pocket). The speakers fit into a gym bag. I am planning to take along this system when we travel.I have read several reports of 'channel imbalance' with these amps, particularly the -100. Now I do not know what I am doing "right," but I CAN tell you that I hear NO channel imbalance at all with either of my samples of these amps - NONE whatsoever!I will tell you that I do use "better" cables with my equipment - NOT ridiculously expensive 'exotic' cables, but Stellar Labs SLV-series cables, available from MCM Electronics (when MCM has a sale - which is quite often - their cable prices are almost unbelievable) - these Stellar cables are used to attach the sound source, such as the CD player, to the amp - as well as 12-gauge speaker cable (Parts Express had a 'sale' on AR 12-gauge speaker cable last year and I bought a LOT of it) to connect the amp to the speakers. (These cables fit into my gym bag along with the speakers.)I cut the speaker cables, which came on 60-foot spools, in half, each 'side' being 30-feet in length. I used the banana plugs which are supplied with the amplifier to connect the wire to the amp and I bought (from Parts Express) some speaker pins to attach the wires to the speakers.All of the connections are gold-plated and all the wires/cables are thick, heavy-duty, and extremely well-constructed. (The connections on the Stellar cables are particularly robust.)I do not know if this has anything to do with the "no channel imbalance" present with my samples or if it just 'luck' (if that's the case, I hope it continues!).Or maybe it's just that the manufacturer in China has gotten its quality control (consistency) tight and you no longer have to worry about any imbalances or other anomalies. I believe that that's what has happened.If you were to buy this amplifier either from Parts Express (that's where I bought mine) or from Amazon, and if there were to be some noticeable channel imbalance (or any other apparent defect), both of these companies would allow you to exchange the sample at no cost to you.Frankly, I do not think this problem is as widespread as it may appear at first. I have no doubt that some people did have this problem but I think that it must have been corrected by now. Certainly my units, ordered just as anybody would order them (there's nothing special about me), arrived perfectly in every regard (and the year-old DTA-100 continues to function perfectly).The one thing I dislike is the naming and marketing of the amp, the fact that it's called the DTA-100a (it SHOULD be called the DTA-60a) and its advertising as a 50 W/channel amp. Dayton Audio (Parts Express) ought to know better. It's a 30 W/channel amp. Period. Distortion of "&lt; 5.0%" (at 50 W/channel) just doesn't cut the 'hi-fi" mustard. You wouldn't want to listen to anything at 5% distortion!30 W/channel, with a &lt; 0.01% distortion figure, is more like it - a true high-fidelity specification. And that's what this amplifier is.Of course, when it comes down to brass tacks, the important quality is how the music sounds. In a word, to me it sounds superb. I own a few complete "sound systems" but I told my wife yesterday that, if I absolutely had to, I could live with this one alone. And I mean that!For use as the heart of a second system, for use when traveling, for use by a child (it's as simple to use as is possible - and the child will NEVER 'outgrow' it), or for many other uses (your choice), I believe you could not buy a better amplifier than this one. And even if larger, more powerful, and more expensive amplifiers or receivers are more versatile, shall we say they offer more connections and features, the sound quality they produce will be no better than the sound quality this one produces. After all, an amplifier is supposed to produce absolutely no "sound coloration" of its own - and this one certainly fulfills that obligation.Adding an inexpensive audio (or audio/video) switcher box, should you wish (Amazon offers many choices), would allow you to connect several components (CD, cassette, tuner, etc.) at the same time, just like with those expensive receivers - and that would alleviate any "versatility" concerns. And the overall price would still be much lower than that of most "quality" receivers.If I could, I'd give this DTA-100a 10 stars. Obviously I recommend it highly and I thank you for reading this and for considering my opinions.

GO ONECALL ELECTRONICS...!!If you wish to buy this TV go with ONECALL ELECTRONICS for their excellent customer service and willing to help with more discount.The LG LX955 55" I bought after 3 months of research and reviews was the best choice, in terms of picture quality and the Local demming technology combined with the modern glass screen it fits well in any room.My TV is mounted and it will give any visitor the the WOW !! EFFECT in terms of design and the modern look.The remote control is easy to navigate, so is the Magic wand remote control.Each button is well placed and spaced out, the remote has a backlight for use in the dark.The LX9500 is connected to my Samsung 3D BD-C6800 with built in wireless Blueray player and within 5 seconds of powering the unit on, I was on the Internet(Netflix) watching SPARTACUS..my God the picture quality was amazing, the color sequence between each scene. The best I ever saw and it is better than the Samsung C9000 that was my first choice.LG LX9500 is the best LED 3D TV in the market, it is a little heavy with lots of output for any device you have now or in the future. TRUE-MOTION works excellent in action movies so each scene is not missed or dull unlike other high end Televisions. the cross-talk on the 3D is not noticeable at all.. excellent 3D sequence, color, motion and crystal clear picture was amazing.. WOW !!!.. it s truely the one in LED TV.The LG LX9500 has a built in surround sound speakers at the back, its sounds well, but mine is connected to my BOSE home theatre sytem and the sound combined with the look and quality of the movies is AWSOME !!! simply cannot describe the effect.The LG LX9500 "yes does reflect light to the screen if you have a bright room, but if you place it in a room with curtain or few windows you will not notice the light reflection at all, but sit and enjoy the work of art.it is called the boarderless TV even though it boarder is present but very slim to the glass edge.If reflection would be a problem buy it and work with your environment were you would place it, or simple increase the backlight on the Television to eliminate the reflection..The LG LX9500 55" I have is the LG Infinia brand the top of the line but the word "TOP OF THE LINE" here is true in terms of technology and picture quality.. design and built in content.Yes, its expensive and one of the Best high end 3D televion but its worth the price.

$review_text.: First let me say that I was surprised by the very small size of the 5100. It literally fits in the palm of my hands.My last Nikon was the Coolpix 995 (950 before that) and I never used most of its advanced options because the menu system was too complex. The 5100 is crammed with buttons and dials so that choosing most options can be done without paging through multiple levels of menus. Plus it has 15-preset types of "scenes" (portrait, sunset, museum, etc., plus the super-cool panorama setting) which make all the necessary settings for you automatically for a particular type of picture. Another cool feature is its ability to make time-lapse movies, as well as 640x480 30fps movies and sound recordings.But the main attraction of the camera for me was its fast lens with Vibration Reduction. I've taken sharp pictures in very low light which I had been unable to take with the old Nikon.Another feature I was not aware of until I got the camera is its ability to do digital zooms without image degradation (if you are shooting at less than maximum size, which I usually do anyway). When I shoot at 1600x1200 size, I can use digital zoom to get the equivalent of about a 7x optical zoom lens.I was considering the Nikon S10 (too much noise in low-light and difficulty focusing in low light) and then the D40 (no auto-focus in-camera, no VR without buying very expensive lenses). It would be nice to have something like an 18x optical zoom on the 5100, but short of that, this camera is very, very good -- especially at such a low price.

$REVIEW.: Wow this has got to be one of the best routers out there. The build quality is absolutely amazing which is probably why this model costs as much as it does. The design itself is simply gorgeous. The setup is EXTREMELY easy. The menu interface is super clean and super simple to use and very "pretty". For those wondering this router does indeed allow you to disable SSID broadcast for both 2.4/5GHz bands independently. The three external antennas are removable which is nice. One thing to be aware of is the fact this router does not come with a vertical stand so if you want to mount it vertically you'll have to screw it to a wall or similar vertical surface.One very nice feature that is included with this router is the internet based remote router management system. Linksys makes this very easy and straightforward. All you have to do is create a free account at [...] and you're able to manage the router from anywhere that has an internet connection..no complex port configurations required. There are also special apps for your phone/tablet that allows different ways to connect with various devices on your network. I'm using the free "Linksys Smart Wi-Fi" iOS app instead of the browser on my iPhone. The router has two integrated USB ports allowing you to connect storage devices like hard drives. There's built-in media serving so you could access videos/music/pictures from those USB devices from your smartphone and tablets as well as computers. Performance is great and I haven't had any issues with this router so far.This router is replacing myBelkin AC1200 Dual Band Wireless AC Router. The Linksys compares favorably against the Belkin. Both work well and both have their strengths and weakness. The Linksys supports higher speeds, super simple user setup/settings and remote management, better build quality and an extra set of external antennas. The Belkin offers more user tweakable settings and auto reboot scheduling.Update: 3/14 Router is still working great no lost connections etc. Also was able to test out firmware update function through the IOS app and it was so easy.

$REVIEW.: Great headphones. I replaced my Plantronics wired one with this and truly enjoy the wireless freedom. The product certainly needs imrovement. Lacking the following1. Bluetooth connection - understand that this is now available in H800 the next model2. Clear indication of battery either on the headphone or via an interface on the computer3. Mute button position is awkward. I gave it to my wife to use and she had to take the headphone by the mute button (right underneath the right ear cup) and kept accidentally pressing it4. Some kind of an indication that it is on mute - the small beep is not enough and get drowned when on a conference call. Here is where an app on the computer comes handyI use my application's mute (Lync) so that I can avoid this issue. Otherwise good headphone and decent battery life.

$review_text.: Wow......just got this today......don't know why I waited so long to replace my older film (albeit pro grade) lenses from the 1980's and 1990's that I was using with my 2006 DSLR camera. The images from this lens are like looking at the subjects themselves with your own eyes. Razor sharp and hyper-real. I mean flat out flawless color, clarity, contrast, sharpness, etc, etc. Distortion is not as bad as I had heard but many computer programs fix that stuff if you really care. I'm used to carrying around heavy f/2.8 lenses anyway (even on vacation) so the weight of this does not bother me. It is heavy as heck, however! The bokeh rocks! I am just blown away by this lens. I don't think it's comin' off the camera for a while. Do yourself a favor and just go ahead and get it. I promise you won't be disappointed.Update 10/26/07:o.K., so I am a little disappointed in the barrel distortion and pincushion of this lens. Not only is it very pronounced, but often it is not elliptical and looks really bad. If you have straight lines in your picture (top of building, brick wall, etc) and this effect happens, it is so bad that the picture is ruined. No way to correct non-elliptical distortion (at least not with the programs I have, and I have Photoshop CS2)
$SUMMARY.: So sharp it cuts glass.

$review_text.: I purchased these to evaluate for a friends very large installation in a home he is currently building.  With the prospects of having to terminate approximately 100 ends plus potentially making a good number of patch cables, I knew the ability to pass the ends of the wires through the end of the connectors would save a lot of time.I have been in the IT field for almost 2 decades and have terminated my fair share of network cables.  So I knew what to expect.I purchased these along with the platinum tools matching crimper which you have to have to cut the ends of the wires off the end of the connector.I have a couple issues with these connectors.1). The individual wires are a little difficult to line up and get though the holes in the connector.  I have used other connectors that seem to have channels to assist with this.2). The strain reliefs are kind of gimmicky to get to work.  It is not immediately noticeable what direction the strain reliefs are inserted into the connectors.  Its obvious which end goes where but its not obvious the orientation as you insert the strain reliefs into the connectors.  Thy could almost work when rotated on the wire 180 degrees, or in lamens terms upside down.  Not a big deal.  You will figure it out quick but it should be obvious or written somewhere.3). And the biggest issue with these is they will not work with cat6a.  I know it doesn't say cat6a in the description but I came to the conclusion that cat6+ could be interpreted to include cat6a.  My mistake. I think it should be explicitly mentioned up front that it will not work.  The cabling used in my friends install is unshielded cat6a riser wire and the wire is too think for the strain reliefs.  It would potentially still work if not using the strain reliefs but I purchased these to use them.
$SUMMARY.: Great idea.  Still not perfect.

$REVIEW.: I do not think you can go wrong with the C910. Set up was less then 5 minutes from box to working using Windows 7.Works great with every server I have tried including Skype. The sound quality is excellent. Still pictures are at least as good as My Samsung 12MP camera and Videos are clear under any lighting conditions and change automaticly. Video quality is outstanding for a product in this price range.The cord length is niether to long nor to short for Desktop use. Another thing, many reviews have addressed is the need for a clamp to hold the C910 to your monitor or laptop securely. Reading the instructions and just a little effort will show the design of the C910 will hold it on your desktop or laptop just fine, using the design properly is the key.I think you will enjoy this product and as with all Logitech products I own I find it to be well made and highly functional.

$REVIEW.: I recently purchased a Kodak Zi8 pocket camcorder and wanted to find the perfect case for it.  I've been using a Ridge 10 for the past 3 years with my digital camera so I knew the quality was great.  The Ridge 30 fits the Zi8 perfectly.  It's snug but not too tight.  There is plenty of room in the pocket under the flap for an extra battery or two and I have an extra SDHC card in the zippered front pocket.  My Ridge 10 has held up well and I expect the same of the Ridge 30.

$review_text.: This phone has great sound for the price... sometimes.At first, it was hard to tell how to rate the sound in this, because it seems to vary depending on what I plug it into.  When I listen to MP3s from my computer, this thing seems muddy and bass-heavy, and I prefer using my old Sony Walkman phones (MDR-027), cheap though they are.  On the other hand, when I listen to MP3s from my phone (a Moto W233 Renew), the new Koss phones sound perfectly fine, and the old Sony sounds hopelessly tinny -- much like the earbuds that the phone came with.  It's as if the two sources are playing the same music with drastically different EQ... but it's not only that, because it sounds like there's distortion changes too.  I don't understand it.  Something to do with impedance, maybe.After a little fiddling with the computer, the problem doesn't seem as bad -- I'm not hearing the distortion that was appearing before, and it's not as muddy, though it's still bass heavy, and less clear than the same track played from my phone.  Whatever the problem is, I'd guess it's probably not the headphones' fault.So anyway, in at least one context, the Koss really sounds very good, and transforms my phone as a music player from a joke into something very usable.  And it does quite well at producing strong volume from a battery-powered source.  And price-wise, it's quite a value for that level of sound quality.(Note: if your phone, like mine, uses a 2.5mm jack, you'll need an adapter.  Maybe one with a microphone in it, in case a call comes in.  I have one such from Sanyo, which is very cheap and flimsy... hopefully something better is available.)Where this headphone is lacking is in its comfort level and construction quality.  It pinches your head too hard (but it seems to be possible to deform the plastic to be looser), and the ear pads are smallish and easily moved off-center (which affects the tonal balance).  Those can be worked around, but there's one problem I don't know what I can do about: the hinges attaching the earpieces to the headband are loose and not smooth, and they MAKE CREAKING NOISES whenever you shift your head or move your jaw!  Once you start noticing it, it gets quite annoying.  Maybe I can, like, pack the little hinge sockets with wax paper or something.  But mainly, if I want to listen to music with these, I just do so while lying very still.[update]  The cord failed after three years.  I replaced it with a similarly priced Sony ZX100.  This is better in many ways than the Koss, but not all.  The Koss still wins on clarity, I think.  But the Sony has flatter response and doesn't need EQ tweaks.  And it's much more solidly constructed, but the tradeoff is that it's heavier.  On comfort, neither has much advantage.
$SUMMARY.: good sound, not so good ergonomics..
overall, quite a value

$REVIEW.: I decided to buy an iPod shuffle because I was getting tired of listening to the same music over and over again on my currentMP3 player

 I was shocked at it's sheer lightness
 Heres a few things to compare it's 'weight' to everyday objects (about .90 oz)2 nickles, 1 penny and 1 quarter; 3 quarters and 1 penny; 1 cd + 1 dime / penny; 10 pocket tissue pack (15 pack, 5 used); 1 - 1/2full lip balm; 1 car key or 1 remote for my car; 1 AA battery or 1/3 the weight of my empty leather wallet (3oz)!The size is a little smaller then these keys going up: CTRL (command key on a Mac), SHIFT, Caps Lock, Tab and also the keyabove that

Unpacking was pretty easy

 What I got was: 1 shuffle with USB cap (protects the USB plug, has two balls inside toattach to the iPod shuffle unit, 1 cool necklace lanyard, a pair of the famous iPod earbuds, 2 packs of black pads for the buds,2 white Apple logo window stickers for advertisment I guess, iPod and iTunes for Mac/Windows Installer CD, Users Guide(recommend you read!), and other papers.Once you install iTunes and iPod installers it asks to register your iPod with it's serial number


 Tip: instead of squinting on theiPod, it's also on the retail package


 I'm not going to go into loading music or anything to the iPod

 It took about 10-15minutes to copy 130 songs on my USB 1.1 port


 USB 2.0 is faster but I don't have it on my PC


 As for battery life:  It came prettywell charged, the battery light was green when I pressed the indicator


 I charged it some more for about an hour before Iused it
 It hasn't gone below green for me yet
 I only charge it maybe less then 2 hours a week - no lie


 And I use it about 2-3hours a day.iTunes is cool
 Just plug in your iPod, iTunes will open, and click Autofill


 Autofill automatically selects random songs for aplaylist of your choice, and adds them to your iPod so you never get bored of listening to the same music
 I listen to songs Ihaven't heard in years, and some I have never heard at all.As for the quality of the music it plays - it's just great!  I don't HEAR the difference between a CD player and my shuffle!  Thedefault ear buds really stink though
 They are really huge and painful


 It does come with pads for the ear buds, but I lost oneafter a few days because they don't like to stay in place


 Please don't wear them to promote your iPod..
there are betterheadphones out there!Speaking of promoting your iPod, the included lanyard is pretty cool and handy
 I used it to take a long stroll around townand it worked great until a huge thrust of wind started to whip it so I had to hold it until the wind slowed down


 But my friendsdemostrated how easy it is for someone to just rip it off your neck

 To attach the shuffle on the lanyard, just take the USB capoff and replace it with the cap on the lanyard string


 It's really that easy.I love having a flash drive where ever I go
 Inside iTunes you can specify how much space should be reserved for file storage


 Iusually keep about 10 megs free.If the earplug cord accidently comes out, the shuffle is smart and pauses itself

 To lock the buttons, hold down the pause button until the orange light blinks off


 Tip: in shuffle mode press play three times to rerandomize the randomized songs, in play in order mode, the same goes back to the begining of the playlist..CONS:  The slider on the back and the USB cap likes to scrape the dirt from your fingers, and makes the buttons really look uglyso I usually clean it with a toothpick every now and then

 In windows, the iPod folder is hidden from view unless you enablewindows to show hidden files/folders


 So if you want to play your music on a machine without iTunes, you have to enable thehidden files


 Interestingly enough, on a Mac, these files and folders are not hidden
 Also no EQ settings, but I never found aneed for them yet
 I never really used them before and the sound I hear is near perfect anyways

 Windows 2000/XP or MAC OS X only needed for iTunes
 That's a serious draw back...

$review_text.: Never before have I seen such a consensus regarding a set of headphones. Everyone seems to love and adore these headphones and I don't quite understand why. I recently purchased a pair of Sennheiser HD 515 phones and they are suitable headphones for day to day use. Unfortunately, the Sennheiser set seriously lacked bass response and after a while it really started to bother me.I headed over to head-fi to ask for recommendations on a middle-tier set of phones to use exclusively for bass. I wanted a set that would pump, and punch, and kick the way the Sony XBs bass kicks, but I wanted a comfortable set of phones that I could wear for a long periods.A near unanimous consensus emerged on head-fi that the Denon AH-D2000 were perfect for me and so I purchased them on that recommendation. Unfortunately, when they came and I plugged them into my FiiO E-7 DAC/Amp, to my surprise they had pitiful bass. In no way was this set of phones even remotely equal to a high bass headphone.Ironically, the sound clarity and quality itself is amazing, if you want a clean balanced overall sound. The trebles and mids sound spectacular. Unfortunately, I didn't want high grade audio-phile highs and mids, I wanted deep, pulsating bass response.The Denon 2Ks are absolutely positively NOT for bassheads, but they are perfect for every day consistent use. It may seem unfair to rate a product 3 stars when I just stated how impressive the phones are overall but I only purchased these based on review after review gushing over the great bass in these phones when in reality, these phones have no bass what-so-ever (not even close to what you might get from a pair of Sony XBs).

$review_text.: Well, one complaint, but it's not Roku's fault.  It's Hulu and how bad Hulu Plus is.Well, we had Netflix streaming through our Blu Ray player but we moved and we have a 6 month old son so we didn't want the model/router in the living room just so the Blu Ray player could be hardwired.  We also have Xbox Gold so we could watch Netflix over our wireless but I hate using such a powerful machine to do something so menial.  And we already owned a bunch of Amazon VOD content so the Roku seemed like the perfect tool.Thus far, it has been.  We don't have cable/satellite so the only stuff we watch on our TV is streamed or downloaded and then played through the Xbox (that's rarely the case).  So, the Roku lets us watch older shows and movies (Netflix) and newer shows and movies as well as on demand rentals (Amazon VOD) for less than what basic cable costs.  It hooked up to our wireless quick and easy - entering the password for the WPA2 Personal security was easy enough and it only took me a few seconds to add the Roku remote to our universal remote.Honest to goodness, this thing is so easy to use that my luddite mother-in-law figured out how to use it.  I didn't see a real need to pay an extra $20 to get a USB port or the fancier wifi antennae (we don't use the dual band N signal, just the older single band).  We have cable internet which averages about 13 Mbps and shows on Netflix and AVOD only take a few seconds to load and then play without a hiccup in beautiful quality.And the box is so tiny, it sits on top of our Blu Ray player (which is off most of the time, so there's no heating issue) and you can't hardly see it (everything in the entertainment center is black).I don't get the goofy purple cloth bit sticking out the side of the unit and the remote, but, whatever - aesthetics aren't #1 on my list.Anyway, setup was easy, getting it hooked up was easy, use is easy and it does so much.  It's a great way to take advantage of the Netflix streaming.

$review_text.: I have this attached over the network to a computer and then a Hauppauge 950Q USB attached for 3 tuners for the computer. They have the same cabling to the same antenna. But in MCE the Hauppauge has 55 channels with 6 bars and 2 with 2 bars. The HomeRun has 12 with 6 bars, 15 with 4 bars, and 12 with 2 or 3 bars. The others with HDHomeRun just dont show connection. So I went through and individually excluded channels so that they would only record with the Hauppauge. But that is both a pain and restricts the value of 3 tuners. While I am getting 2 tuners for the price of one with HDHomeRun, I would not purchase again. Inferior tuner quality isn't worth the savings to me. I would rather have another USB tuner with better reception and only have 2 tuners.Update 8-29-13 - After more than a year, I gave up on getting real quality from the HDHomeRun. I bought another Hauppauge USB 950 (4 USB tuners now in total) and I just use the HDHomeRun when I am in a pinch and need a 5th or 6th tuner. I just want more quality than it can deliver.

$REVIEW.: I used this for my basement workout room to hold a DVD player under a mounted flat screen.Overall this is 3/5 for the quality of materials


considering the price I gave it a 4/5

if you have a secondary television and you need an affordable mount, this is it


However for a main system, this would look cheap sitting next to a $2500 television.Basically this would be worth it for double the price on amazon, but don't consider it a fine piece of furniture., if you do you'll be disappointed.Also the assembly instructions are a 2/5


Yes they are accurate, and yes, you probably need an engineering degree or have put together at least 50 things from Ikea to consider it easy


(which I have both) One thing I think companies like this should start doing is providing a youtube video link for instructions, printed on the box or on the manual
would be a lot easier to follow along on screen than try to figure out what goes where.

$review_text.: I purchased this amp for my computer sound system.  I use it with a pair of "antique" 8 ohm Klipsch .5 bookshelf speakers which have a sensitivity of 90dB @ 1watt/1meter.  This amp cleanly drives these speakers louder than I would every want to listen to in my 12'x14' room.  For anyone who has a spare pair of bookshelf speakers I would highly recommend this amp instead of buying a too expensive and too cheap computer speaker system.  If you don't have speakers you will have to pay more to go this route but you will end up with a system that is 10x better than computer speakers of the same price.I read some complaints about the blue light around the volume knob.  While I agree it could be a bit more muted, it isn't as bad as I thought it would be. I think this amp is a good value at twice the price I paid and I'd pay twice again if it included a few additional features.  For example, drop the mounting flairs on the bottom and add rubber feet, add a headphone jack on the front, add a mute button and lengthen the power cable.The reason I knocked a star off the rating was for the power adapter.  It's a bit too big but the real problem is that the cord is way too short.  I want the volume knob close to me for easy access but the length of the power cord only allows it to live on the very back of my desk.  Unless your power strip or outlet is placed perfectly, you will have to compromise on the placement of the amp itself.

$REVIEW.: At first glance, right away your going to take notice to the astute care and design the company put into making sure they made this stand out among the competitors iPad cases with Bluetooth capabilities.The look and feel of the case is great, right out of the package the leather smell will let you know that you spent your money wisely. Opening the flip case you will notice that it has the typical iPad casing, one that didn't make me happy! Only because I prefer a more protective overlay on top op my iPads glass; it sits cradled within the leather side-bindings, and an over-flap that is suppose to secure it in place...from keeping it from sliding out upon opening the case, or simply from sliding within the case.Less I digressed...as the iPad sits within the leather case snugly, the problem begins when you choose to use the case as it is intended to, a portable viewing, propped, tablet-like work-station. I found this to be one of the worst kickstand type cases I have ever used.Two reasons: The First being the leather "over-flap" I mentioned above; it failed miserably at keeping the iPad secure in the leather border; the weight of the iPad is just to much for the leather flap. Now for the second reason...Once the iPad slumps down into the base of the case while in the upright position, (use of the kickstand) your view of the screen is skewed; if you try to reposition the iPad, the iPad will topple backwards because the slightest touch to the system buckles and collapses the poorly designed kickstand I tried multiple times to rectify this, less pull the kickstand out of its extending limits. (It is about a 3 inch attached strap, & once pulled out into the "stand" position, it doesn't allow for anything farther than the straps length).The Bluetooth Keyboard: This is by far one of my favorite designs yet! I couldn't believe how sturdy, yet amazingly light, slim, & portable this keyboard is. The keyboards layout is like most compact designs; it has all of the same functions and accessibilities as most on the market, but aesthetically it looks and feels great. The soft keys and quiet compressions as you type would certainly be welcomed in any public situation.Pairing this keyboard is as simple as the flick of the switch on the side of the keyboard, turn it on, press the Bluetooth pairing (you will see the blue light)...of course, make sure your Bluetooth is on and in search mode on your device. It's that simple, began typing. You will see a slight lag at first, but then the system will sync quite quickly and the lag will be unnoticed until you take a break, and the Bluetooth recognizes the pairing and that typing has continued.Having the ability to detach the keyboard is a bonus; in my opinion it offers the user the ability to reposition the keyboard in a position that is suitable for your eye sight, arms length, and of course accessibility. Think about other attached keyboards that tire your arms due to being bent in such a manner for extended periods of time, not to mention having the ability to set the distance from the iPad screen.To recap:Pro's: Asthetically this leather case is very appealing, it feels great and makes any user feel like they made a great choice; I respectfully would put this type of case under the "executive" designs, but that is simply my opinion.This SHARKK case with BT, makes the portable workstation concept easier to obtain; it's a great value and even more impressive keyboard design will ensure the consumer is pleased with their choice of purchase.Con's: The iPads insert into the leather binding, secure flap, and the lack of a protective covering for the screen are simple concerns, but nonetheless, they are note-worthy concerns. The kickstand in my opinion needs a serious redesign; and lastly, the switch used to turn the keyboard on, and the button to used for pairing is absolutely in need of redesign! It would be easily rectified if each of these mentioned could be relocated onto the keyboard pad.My overall recommendation is that it is a great purchase and the few con's do not outweigh the overall make-up and portability this case has to offer.NOTE: I apologize for not mentioning that while your iPad is in the bindings within the case & keyboard, in it is closed, it will not fall out of the case. it is VERY SECURE in the system; and for those of you who are looking for a more inconspicuous iPad cover/case, this is it. It seriously looks more like your appointment binder while closed up.Hope this helps,VrKeith

$review_text.: So far, so good. I plugged it in and ran a fresh install of windows. The windows install recognized the drive, formatted it, and had no issues. Windows boots in a fraction of the time now and has none of the slow-motion hang once it gets to the desk top. The computer still has to run through its checks but once it hits the load screen, it's 13 seconds and in, ready to go full speed.That said, the product packaging could use some upgrades. The instructions stink (they're just pictures!&#34; and the 2.5&#34; to 3.5&#34; adapter / mounting bracket is not included. Good luck finding one of those at 8 PM on a Friday.

$review_text.: I have 2 complaints about theses gloves:1) Your hands will get hot and clammy pretty quickly2) In Punch-Out you need the A & B buttons on the controller for certain moves. Since the controller is on the back of your hand, the A button can be pushed (but you'd have to use the other hand, limiting it) and the B button is inaccessible.I like the concept of the glove, but it's much easier to survive the game with the controller in hand. It may be useful for other games that use the controllers in a more basic mode (haven't tried Wii Sports yet), but not for this one game.

$review_text.: I was in the process of building a new PC for myself a few months ago, and frankly, the 900D wasn't out. From what I am reading, it's a good thing I went with the 800D. Now, let me describe a few things. Let me describe a bit about the system, first:System Board: Asus Maximus V FormulaCPU: i7-3770K, 3.9GHzCPU Cooling: Corsair H100iMemory: Corsair Dominator Platinum 2133MHz, 16GB (8x2)Video: Asus GTX 660Ti OCPower: Corsair AX860iDisks: Samsung 840Pro SSD, 128GB, WD Raptor 2x75GB & 150GBCD: PioneerWith this, I'm not sure I've ever had as much space to work as I've had in this case. My other case being an ABS Canyon 695, which is TALL, but not deep. The Corsair 800D is shorter, but much deeper, and this makes sense when you get into the ergonomics of putting everything into the case. This case is also mostly aluminum with the other pieces being steel. This case is NOT light, and when you put in all your gear, it gets heavier. I have mine sitting on magic sliders so I can easily push/pull it from under the desk. An additional note to under the desk, this case will protrude from under the desk by 4-5 inches being as deep as it is, however it is a good 4-5 inches shorter than the desk, so you can easily put it under any desk.Unlike a few others, my backplane was fine for the storage bays. The instructions are not super-clear on this item, but you will be able to figure it out. The only problem I had with the backplane and hotswap bay was that my Samsung SSD would not just slide onto the drive cart and plug into the backplane. I ended up buying a conversion tray from Amazon, which I actually had to use in my Canyon for its backplane hotswap drive setup for my Intel SSD. Once I put it in the tray, it plugged right into easily pushed into the top bay and I was ready to roll. As pointed out here, the screws for my Samsung SSD didn't seem to be standard. The reason I say that is that the ones for the Intel were also not standard - I had to use the screws that came with the drive in order to place them into the trays. My Western Digital drives were all standard screws and I used them to mount the other drives. I will also say that the metal door to the drives seems to contact the bottom part of the opening, but not to the point that the door doesn't open or close.For the CD drive install, if there is a complaint, the sliders for the 5.25" bays don't quite work as intended. You should be able to slide your drive in, then kinda lock them in place with no screws using these plastic clips which secure through a spring-type device. I ended up unrailing two of these sliders by accident.. and putting them back together was a royal pain - but I was able to do it. Seems like these could have been a little more rigidity put into these devices. Once it was in, I was good and it worked fine.Now, the front connector panel does come a little close to the top 5.25" bay when it's opened up. If I open it up, I usually have to press down a little on the CD drive bezel so that I can close the front connection panel door. That door also seems to have a weird feel to it - you press it until you hear a click, then it either opens or you have secured it shut. Seems there is a bit too much effort involved to close/open this door, to the point of am I going to break the door? :)Installing the H100i fan assembly to the top of the case was EASY, and so was the mounting of the system board (the opening behind the processor can't be overlooked - it's a GREAT breakthrough), video card, and PSU. The cable routing was really made easy thanks to all of the rubber-grommeted openings that are really positioned all around the system board mounting area. I'll say it agin, the panel BEHIND the system board cannot be overlooked as an advantage - this is a godsend when you're trying to put in an aftermarket cooling mount for the processor which basically has to be done AFTER the board is mounted in the case. This door allows access to the surrounding mount points without having to remove the board from the case.I also love how the intake comes up from the floor, which is filtered, and keeps all the dust out. This system has been running for months and I don't see quite the same buildup of dust that I saw in my Canyon. Of course, having a great, clear side-panel is also quite a treat so I can see what I have built. :)All in all, I'd give the case an 8/10 or 9/10, only because of the few fit/finishes issues I found of the doors. It was a very well thought-through design and I appreciate the effort that went into it that made my life easy when building the machine.

$REVIEW.: No surprises whatsoever. I needed to replace two older questionable 320 GB WD drives in my HP Pavilion dv7 laptop. I wasn't sure the new drives (2) would work because HP didn't list the 750 GB drive as a viable replacement. However, I think this was because the 2.5 in. 750 GB drive wasn't available yet. I cloned my existing drives to the new ones using the Acomdata Tango USB 2.0/eSATA 2.5-Inch SATA Hard Drive Enclosure. Both drives are working flawlessly and I use the old 320 GB drives in the (2) Acomdata Hard Drive Enclosures for data backup.

$REVIEW.: I originally ordered and tried to use a Griffin product that held my iPod and plugged into the cigaretter lighter in my car. The product did not fit well in the space around the lighter and I had great difficulty making adjustments (such as changing the FM station when driving from one region to another).So I opted for simplicity. The 9501 consists of a lighter plug-in, a small control box and an iPod adapter on a three foot cord. First, the FM signal feature generally functions well. Expect periodic problems in areas with high FM channel density. But this occurs with any unit using FM to link into your car's sound system.What is really neat is the little control box with a channel preset feature. Driving along I can quickly and safely change from one FM channel to another using the preset button. It holds five channels I believe. Searching for non-programmed channel is also easy using the toggle button. Since the box is on a wire I can hold it in front of me to change the channel without taking my eyes off the road.Having the iPod attached to a cord also provides a significant safety advantage. Again, I can hold the iPod in front of me to change play lists without taking my eyes off the road. And when I'm not using the iPod the entire unit can be wrapped up and put in the glove compartment.Before going too "hi tech" I would highly recommend giving this little device a try. Again, realize that using FM transmission for access to your car's sound system will always result in moments of distortion. If you are real stickler for sound quality then pay the money and hard wire your iPod into the sound system. But if you an occasional user like me with an average "ear" take a look at the 9501.

$REVIEW.: Got this to replace a 6 year old linksys router. I've used a ton of different routers over the years. Thought I'd give this one a go from all the high reviews and price for my boss in our office. The router had trouble bridging with time Warner's modem but I suspect it had more to do with time Warner. But I had to call media link and got no live support. I was asked to leave a voice message. A few hour later a tech got back to me. The plus side was the tech was American and knowledgable.  When I told him I knew some of the advance steps he took me seriously and gave a higher than &#34;let me read my script&#34; support. However once working the router gave a weaker signal than my 6 year old linksys to a computer 15 feet away. Ended up boxing it and sending it back.

Then I ordered this one.  This one is a little gem.  It works as expected - perfectly, and the surprise is the blue ring of light on its face when it is "off" so it can be found in the dark when needed most.  It is a bit brighter than a penlight, but of course not as bright as a full-sized flashlight - that is not expected with this size light.  It stays charged, and the USB is a feature that will be increasingly used as 5-volt devices that need to be powered or charged become more and more common.By the way, the description provided by Amazon is way off base.  It is not a "car charger."  It has a 5-volt usb port that can power or charge small electronic devices.  It is not designed to charge "cars."  The writers for Amazon need an English lesson.

$review_text.: I bought this router to replace the trusty MediaLink 300mpbs I previously owned. Nothing was wrong with my medialink but I wanted something with a little more features such as VPN and better parental features. The setup was simple, I just went to the IP address on the router and proceeded with setting wireless access. I work in IT so I like features like that allow me to remotely access my machines. I was able to setup the wireless access, VPN, Wake on Lan, guest network, and 5ghz wireless access within 20 minutes. The setup is so simple that even people with a low amount of IT knowledge could set this up. This router has features that will suit basic and advanced users. I just bought this item so if anything changes, I'll update this post.***EDIT 3/8/2014**** After using the VPN , the only option is pptp VPN, which has many vulnerabilities. I thought that the more I dug the better the VPN option would be but I was wrong. Maybe the next firmware will have better VPN options. Other than that, the router is still super fast and transfers over wired ethernet go about 60 MBS.

$REVIEW.: It is always a good idea to have a spare battery when out shooting in the field or camping or on a trip


 I have never had a battery go bad, but I have heard they do and I never want to be left without a battery for my camera.

$review_text.: As many have noted before, this is a great camera for the enthusiast, outdoor-oriented photographer.I've owned it for a few months now (it replaced the Nikon D-80 I owned, which I've had quite a few issues with).I've taken it in the snow, in the sun, took closeups, panoramic and action pics with it, and I'm very pleased with the results.Controls are easy to find and handle, screen interface is intuitive and the ergonomics and image quality are great.Knowing this camera can handle the elements is also a big plus for me as I'm quite demanding on equipment in this respect.It is also compact (though not necessarily light) compared with its peers, which is, again, a plus for the outdoors/travel oriented user.On the down side (which I've known in advance but still wish for) are:1. Lack of a double SD slot (which could have been very useful as it would have allowed storing jpg images on a WiFi SD card and RAW on a higher-capacity standard card - this has been added in the newer K-3).2. Lack of tilting screen for taking shots at difficult angels.3. Non standard USB cable port (the camera comes with a cable but it is annoying to have yet another type of cable around).The kit lens performs well, for my needs.
$SUMMARY.: Great camera

$review_text.: This is case is very quiet (with appropriate fan control) and has a nice layout.  It's all screws (that require a screwdriver), inside and out, so quick changes are a little bit of a nuisance.  The screws are worth it to keep noise down, I just wish they would have used one fewer size (there are three different sizes and two are hardly distinguishable).  Plenty of extra hardware is provided.  I didn't have to make any odd modifications to get everything to fit.
$SUMMARY.: Quiet, clean design

$REVIEW.: The only reason I was considering this stand was because my generic brand 22" monitor came with a very, very lame one. I was very hesitant to buy this cause I thought it would be extreme overkill. It would be over 75% of the cost of my monitor... I couldn't believe what I had done when I finished Amazon's checkout process... Now, three months later, I'm getting another one for my mom for use at her workplace.As I mentioned earlier, this holds my 22" LCD (EMPREX brand if you're wondering) monitor very nicely. The monitor is about 17 Lbs and even small adjustments feel very tight. I am a full time student and frequently need to move my monitor out of the way to make room for my studies since I only have one desk for everything I do. Now I have the option of quickly pushing it all the way against my wall or raising it up above my papers. The area taken by the old stand is now free which is very liberating.I also program quite a bit and it's really nice to put my monitor very low and right behind my keyboard so I'm not always moving my head up and down trying to see what special keys I'm hitting. I've probably saved a dozen headaches by doing this. The last thing this stand lets me do is angle, raise, and extend my monitor towards my bed (which is to the right of my desk). This way I can lay down to watch a DVD or sit to play some xbox 360 with my friends.Everyone who has seen this makes a comment about how nice it is. It's a good investment for college students who have limited desktop space and only one monitor for everything they do (computer, cable TV, DVD, consoles).Another reviewer said he doesn't like the cable management system. I'll agree that it's not the best in the world. The plastic retainers feel flimsy and you have to bend up your cables quite a bit to get them to fit. However, I ended up using it and I think it's sufficient/necessary if you move your monitor around a lot. I have three thick cables weaving through the plastics (power, DVI for computer, VGA for xbox) and so far it's been working very well for me.

$review_text.: The Arctic F8 is a nice fan, good flow per noise level, nice looking, doesn't have a stupid LED on it... but there is one major problem... there are 3 things fan buyers want... low noise, high output, great cabling... Arctic totally screwed the cabling part.they have a terrible connector setup, the 4th wire connects separately to the 4 pin motherboard header via a connector... its an awful solution... if they wanted a native 3 pin setup they could have simply had a 4 to 3 pin adapter at the end....  it looks like a rats nest as currently designed...the fan itself is a good design and very quiet, but who wants to screw with the meesy cable on this fan when the Startec and Cooler Master fans are out there at roughly the same price?I am a huge Arctic cooling fan, but they really blew it with this product.I'm taking 3 stars off for the lousy cable... bad design decision.

$review_text.: If all you listen to is rap, techno or dubstep, these could easily be confused with great headphones. I was on a bass craze and decided to try these due to all the positive reviews, and boy am i disappointed. I even tried to "break them in" and still horrible. The are in fact the bassiest earbuds ive heard, but thats it, the highs are like beating on a tin can and the mids are, wait, what mids, i cant hear them at all. Pass on these if you actually want to hear music. Im not one of those audiophile guys that needs 300 dollar headphones either. I listen to rock, metal,screamo  and a little bit of rap and country. I have some Sennheiser cx200's that were 40 bucks and have comparable bass and great sound quality. No more JVC headphones for me. Your better off with some skullcandy's etc.

$REVIEW.: So I just got this case today and the most I can say is it's decent

The plastic backing is appropriately sized for my nexus 7 2013, which snapped right in without any undo straining or bending
The magnets worked as expected, locking and unlocking the device on cue, and the trifold cover doesn't get in the way in landscape, but it does in portrait a bit, which will take some getting used to
While it is possible to prop the tablet upright, it takes a little bit of effort, three folds is not quite as stable as the for folds in the iPad smart cover, and sometimes it will slide down.The biggest disappointment about this case was processing time before the seller shipped it out
It really kind of ruined the point of two day shipping (which USPS accomplished) when the seller took two weeks to ship it.

$REVIEW.: I have been waiting for the 4th Gen. intel CPU to purchase a macbook. This is my first Mac ever and I picked up on it almost intuitively as if I had always used Mac OS X! I wanted the increased battery life that the new intel processor grants (Thank you Intel!) and the sleek, portable design of the 11 inch air. It's only been a few days and I already love it!I picked up the 11 inch because small and portable is better for me personally, I will use this for office, surfing the web, Netflix, and maybe some casual games. I got my base model (4gb ram/i5/128gb) for $899 so it was a great deal! This air is replacing my Ipad 4, after years of using an Ipad (since it's original launch) and loving it, I now find myself needing more of a full fledged laptop but I still wanted the day long battery life that laptops couldn't offer (until now!) and I didn't want another windows laptop.Battery: Why not start with the high point of this generation, let me just say WOW! I cranked out 9 hours and 12 minutes (at about 60% brightness, blutetooth off, and wifi on) on my first complete charge while surfing the web and taking notes in office. I have been waiting for this kind of battery life for a long time and I'm glad it's finally here! Looking forward to Maverick and hopefully even more battery life!Heat/Fan: I've been on it for about 2 hours now typing this up while taking notes in class and It's barley warm. The only time i've heard the fan kick in was while playing portal 2 and it's very quiet!Screen: I'm sad that the resolution didn't get an upgrade but it looks just fine and I would not personally trade off battery life for more PPI, maybe in the next refresh! It's crisp and looks great for what it is which is fine with me. After using a retina screen for almost a year, I do not find it difficult or even consider the downgrade in PPI an issue.Performance: The biggest point here is that Intel made a much more efficient chip with just about equal performance of the previous gen of cpus which is awesome and it should be no surprise to find out that there is no noticeable performance difference between the 2013 and previous air model. No it's not as powerful as something you can get for about the same for windows BUT that's the reason I wanted a Mac, because it's not windows so that argument is null to me. That being said it's plenty powerful for what I use it for.Sound: sounds just fine to me, I wish the sound was a little fuller but I have no quarrels with it.SSD/RAM: Makes everything smooth and seamless.I purchased the 128gb which is perfect since I use cloud storage like dropbox a lot and have a 128gb USB 3.0 stick that is insanely fast. I kind of wish I had 8gb of ram instead of 4gb just because I'm that kind of techie however I know that I won't utilize it. I realize some people need more storage space but there are other good options for those on a budget or who don't think they need extra space and later find themselves short. I do wish it had an SD slot like the 13inch however it wasn't worth the increased size for me.Graphics: The new Intel 5000 is a very nice upgrade from the previous Gen. So far the only game I've played on it is portal 2 and it looks great and plays smoothly (sorry I don't have FPS). From what I've read though, many games run very playable at med to high settings. It's not designed to be a gpu powerhouse but it handles most games pretty well and I'm very happy with that. It does get very warm after a while (1+ hours of gaming) however this is to be expected. It took about 30 mins for me to notice the fan turn on while playing portal 2. The front facing camera is 720p but it looks great and works well enough for me.Design: It didn't change from the previous Gen. but since i've never used a MacBook before; I have large manly hands but I find the keyboard very comfortable, I find that the layout and spacing is perfect for me! The weight and sleek design is excellent for the size IMO. I love the backlit keyboard (which is a MUST imo for all laptops) and the ability to control how long it's on when not typing is awesome (as opposed to simply turning it on and off like my last windows laptop).Overall: I love it, it's not perfect for everyone but it's everything I want and need and it does it all very well. I like that MacBooks hold their value pretty well (something I did not know existed in the laptop market which tells you all you need to know about windows laptops). Perhaps the ONLY disappointment I have is the fact that the SSD and RAM can't be upgraded due to it being integrated into the MB. Very content with this MacBook Air!
$SUMMARY.: Amazing!

$review_text.: I have owned this product for over 2 years now.  I was worried at first as most of my print jobs still come from a Windows98 PC, and by default doesn't have the ability to use an IP address for defining a printer port.  The software added this to my 98 system, and it wasn't needed on any later Windows version. It installed and ran without a hitch (highly unusual today).  I was able to give the printer (print server) a name, tell it the workgroup name, and assign it an IP address), reset everything and it's been working great ever since. I can print from any PC, Windows98, ME, 2000, and XP's, they all print fine, I just install the printer driver on each PC then change it from the LPT1's etc., to use an IP address instead, and that's all it takes.About once every 2 months, none of the computers will print to it, although I can usually ping the print server, it just doesn't print.  I just unplug the power pack and plug it back it, and by the time I get back to the PC it's ready to print again, but this could be my routers rather than this print server.I previously had to have a computer on the network, with this printer marked as shared, it was really annoying to want to print something and have to go turn on another computer first. This completely does away with that.  If the printer is on, you can print to it from any PC, so nice!Not to mention that parallel port devices are becoming hard to find and yet there are still many printers out there still use only parallel, even those that can use a USB, I prefer the parallel ports.  Mouse, keyboard, USB external hard drive, iPod, flash disk, etc., I get tired of unplugging things and everything wants to be USB...I'm sick of it personally.I liked this print server so much, although I only use one, I bought an extra just to have a spare.  If my current one fails, I want another one just like it.

Although, I have to say that this is not the fastest flash drive that I've seen or have but it serves my purpose.I needed a small and very simple flash drive larger than 4GB without any LED or other extra functionality to save my music on it and use in my car to play them

So, I wnated the smallest drive possible that would not attract the attention and also the cheapest
This little tiny drive with the price of aroun $15.00 fits the bill.Overall it has a solid performance


It is not the fastest but it is not the slowest either


For my purpose, I really don't care about the speed than much since I do not need to copy files to it everyday.One thing that I encounter is the fact that this drive it gets really hot

$REVIEW.: This PEX1PCI1 adapter might work perfectly fine in your system, but beware! It may mysteriously disable other peripheral devices in your 64-bit capable system.This adapter was purchased to adapt an RME PCI host card to a PCIe based system running Windows 7 Pro 64-bit on a H67 Sandybridge mobo with 16GB RAM, and three SATA 3 drives. The RME card is a low-profile card, and fits in the adapter with room to spare with the end plate removed. Great! This saved me having to shell out $500 for a new RME card.Wait... Where'd my network card go?The adapter disabled the Realtek Gigabit Ethernet adapter built into the mobo!After some slot juggling, several reboots, and some scans with PCIScope, I discovered the PEX1PCI1 uses a *32-BIT* Pericom PCI bridge, which is very picky where it lives in a 64-bit environment, and to make the problem worse, it requests a 1M memory window from the BIOS. This means it doesn't play nice with 64-bit systems, and can disable other devices in the system.The RME card works fine in my system with I hacked-together PCIe bridge made with a PLX PEX8111 demo board, and it works perfectly, even at 32 samples buffers. Only problem is it's big and has to sit outside the case.Back it goes...

$review_text.: I got these on sale from another site for about $25 less than what the average price on amazon seems to go


I've been using them for the last two months and have been very pleased with them

My major factor in deciding for these were the sound isolation properties (good, not great) and the comfort (they are very lightweight, nicely padded and are easy to forget that you have them on, unless you are in hot weather) - I tend to wear them for 3 hr stretches and have not noted a decrease in comfort after that time
The bass is very solid - I am not an audiophile but I have a good amount of nice audio equipment at home and this sounds as good as anything I have ever bought


I also like that the cord is replaceable and not as long as a lot of other headphones out there (I have no use for anything longer than this and would hate to have a 10 foot cord attached to the headphones).

I own a similar battery from Anker,Anker Astro Slim2 4500mAh Ultra-Compact Portable External Battery Backup Charger Power Bank Charger for iPhone 5S, 5C, 5, 4S, 4 (Apple adapters not included), iPod, Samsung Galaxy Note, Galexy S4, Galaxy S3, Galaxy S2, Galaxy Nexus, HTC One X, One S, S...and I have been using it for a few months now. Comparing the two, the Slim has a bit more charge and fits in a pocket of my carry bag without adding bulk. I take it with me everywhere now. This charger is smaller with a bit less power but fits in a coat pocket or would probably be good in a purse. Really, it's just a matter of personal preference. They both need you to supply your own cable if used to recharge an Apple product. They both recharge themselves in about the same amount of time. They both have a high quality feel and look to them. Anker has winner with both!

A little pushing on the clip (it's malleable) tightened the fit. No issues at all so far.

$REVIEW.: The case fit my transformer pretty tightly
I would rather have it tight than loose
My only complaint with the case other than what has been reviewed all ready like charging with the cover open and the "tenting" effect


Is that the volume and the power buttons are somewhat hard to get too
I mostly got it for the price
And with that being said i think its a great case for the price

Does have a slight scent to it but it is not a bad scent by any means.

$review_text.: It's great for its micro form factor


Just one thing that gets confusing if you're not used to it yet is the missing upper metal shield that usually comes with USB connections isn't there so you must make sure that you are inserting the contacts correctly
Before I got used to using it I inserted it wrong the first time thinking I got a DOA product

Just make sure to usually insert with the logos facing you as per the USB specification
A little bit odd when you're not used to it, but it's worth it for the small form factor.

As it turns out, nothing! These work great with my Motorola Xoom. I tried them out with Photoshop Touch just now and they work great. They make it much easier to make precise selections.And I've got three of them all for a grand total of $1.23. It's hard to see how they can ship them for that price.

So I went on Amazon and saw this keyboard from Pwr+ and ordered it right away. Arrived very fast, and install it in about 30 seconds, and it was a perfect fix and works great. But remember to keep the two little screws from the old keyboard because the new one don't come with the two little screw, which it is alright. Great keyboard and Price, will buy again from Pwr+.

$REVIEW.: first of all. if you are an audiophile you will not be even considiering an amp less than $500. you cant have champaign taste on a beer budget. however this item is well worth the price for the sound that you get. as long as you have the apropriate CLEAN power sorce and you like listening to music FLAT as the musicians designed you to hear it. it is great. the tone options i dont have any use for because i only listen to music and movies flat. i have this hooked up to an old pair of KG.5 bookshelf speakers on my night stands to have a little music in the bedroom. this amp with these sensitive speakers are great. i dont go over 1/4th power because it gets TOO loud. this has alot of power for 20wats RMS. now i Have an Harman Kardon 1700 reciever for my main room with a full 5.1 setup. and obviosly the class and depth of sound is no where near my HK. in fact i would call the sound thin bright and acurate. but not as full as with my HK. probably the watts RMS. i think this a great unit to be used for a cheap outside sound system. a great amp for computer speakers. and with a powered sub. you can easily have a cheap 2.1 setup. if you are looking for a inexpensive stereo setup with beter quality than any stereo at any retail store. then buy this. you won't regret it. worth the $25.00 five times over.

Bios is overclocker's heaven, lots of tweaks, and this board can actually handle them. Have my i5 3570k Overclock by turning up the turbo boost multiplier to 50, i turned up the turbo instead of the core multiplier so that the processor would still take advantage of auto vcore and the ability to throttle CPU up or down based on demand, rather than running a constant 1.3v to vcore and 5ghz, If you are planning on doing a similar Ivy bridge 3rd Gen intel processor build with this cooler be aware that you will need to get much more powerful fans than what come stock with the coolers, and don't even waste your time trying to use intel's stock coolers that come with the processors they are a joke.Gigabyte GA-Z77-D3HCore i5 3570k @ 5.0GHzAntec Kuhler h2o 620 28 Degrees C @ Idle 68 C @ Load w/ 2x120mm fans on push pull configuration8 GB DDR3-1600 PC3-12800 Corsair XMS-3 4x2gb120GB OCZ Vertex 3 SSD- System on raid (500mb/s read 295mb/s write(crystal disk Benchmarks)500GB 32mb Cache WD seagate- HDD (Page Filing and storage)Cooler Master elite 430 Case 5x120mm Case FansCorsair CX-600 Power SupplyGeforce GTX 580Windows experience ratings:  CPU: 7.8 RAM: 7.9 Aero: 7.7 3d Gaming: 7.7 SSD/HDD: 7.9

$review_text.: I got this for my mom for Christmas.  The first one worked flawlessly during Christmas day, and then stopped working completely and started smoking.I was ready to find her something else, but she loved it, so we are trying a second player.Now for the good.  The sound quality is amazingly full.  I wasn't expecting much from this player, and my mom picked it because of its looks, but it really does bring the old vinyl to life,The radio reception for both AM and FM is clear. It plays tapes and CDs very well, too.  I can't comment on MP3 conversion because my mom doesn't use that function.Now the bad.  It does  have an Aux jack that will allow you to play mp3s through the speaker.  The only problem is that when you plug an aux cable in, everything else stops working until the cable is unplugged again.  So, there's no way to keep a cable plugged into this thing while other functions are being used.  The cable has to sit near by or be pulled out of a drawer, the player needs to be slid out for it to be plugged in again, and then removed when the iphone or whatever is disconnected.  What a pain.The buttons and tape deck feel fragile, and I'm dubious about how this will hold up. The wood is very attractive, though, and it looks nice in a &#34;momular&#34; sort of way,  I'm tentatively hopeful that this second player will work out.

I use it daily to carry my laptop and knitting back and forth to work (on the subway)  It is large enough to hold my laptop, extras (hard drive, plugs etc).  It has 2 separate main pockets and I use the front one for my knitting, but it is large enough to use for books binders etc.  There is a small front zipper pocket that is perfect for pens, note pads, etc. And 2 square front pockets that work out wonderful for tissues, makeup, office badge, keys, phone etc..  I get lots of compliments on this backpack.ProsLots of useful pocketsWater resistant - I've used it several times during a downpour and my stuff stayed dryNot too bulky - The rectangular design keeps a fairly slim profile if not over filledCan hold a lot of stuffVery sturdy construction - about a year of daily use and there isn't a single tear or wear spot.  Buckles holding up well.Professional looking backpack without looking like I'm going hiking.ConsCan hold a lot of stuff - I tend to overfill itWish it had a compression strap to use when I don't have much in it.It is a fairly large backpack, so, if you don't need the additional main pocket, then get the smaller version.

Actual write speeds via USB 3.0 were even lower at roughly 6mbps.  Simply put, this drive is unusably slow.  Read speeds are incredibly fast but are crippled by write speeds 1/20th as fast.If write speeds are no concern, you'll probably love this drive overall.  If you want to transfer any files larger than 1/4gb, the slow write speeds will disappoint for sure.

But after that, I've been finding it incredibly easy to use and it's gotten rid of all of my wrist pain from using a normal mouse. I'd try it out for a couple of days before making a decision to keep it, because I can see how it could be more difficult to use for some hand sizes/shapes. I'm a software developer and I'm at my computer all day, so I can tell you that this mouse is the real deal. Also an extremely easy setup on my macbook, just plug and play; no software to download. The ONLY problem I've had with this is that I actually hit it and knock it over with my hand sometimes because it is so high off of my desk. This can be a little annoying at times, but I mostly don't notice it. I can say that it's very reliable as well. I've been using it 4+ hours a day for about 8 months with no problems.

$REVIEW.: I wanted a Blu-Ray player that I could also use as a CD player with a good audio system. Based on magazine and user reviews I went for the Oppo BDP-83; it's pricey but quality is never cheap.This is the best piece of equipment I've bought in ages. You know it's a class act from the minute you open the box: the packing is snug and doesn't crumble, and it's easy to unpack (not so much praise for Amazon's packing: they put the Oppo box in a larger box with loose paper filler, allowing the Oppo box to slide around; no damage, though).The manual (I always read them): It's written by a literate English-speaker and printed as a full-sized book,in a large, bold font on good paper. It has lots of diagrams and explains everything clearly. There are countless combinations of equipment you could use the player with, but you can easily find the part of the manual that you need. Oppo provides an HDMI cable, too.The setup: You hardly need the manual, because when you turn it on a setup wizard figures things out and provides appropriate defaults for outputs, video and sound settings. Two minutes and you're ready to play your disks.Performance: Blu-Ray disks load in a few seconds and the picture and sound are beautiful. The player upscales DVD's, which look as good as you could wish -- not as good as Blu-Ray, of course. As a CD player it produces superb sound (and I'm really fussy), and it plays some disks that don't play on other machines, presumably because of damage or defects in the disks. I have only one SACD but that sounds great too, though I'm not sure the SACD format adds much for my purposes.Updates: I didn't connect it to the internet but I downloaded the latest firmware and installed it by flash drive. No fuss, no problems.Missing features: Note that it won't play 3-D video or stream Netflix, if those things are important to you.I am delighted with the BDP-83. If you agree that quality matters, go for it.
$SUMMARY.: This is the good stuff

$REVIEW.: Got sick of the bagel crumbs on my keyboard ... among other things ... and got one. I was always having to reposition it and fuss with it until one day I sprayed the top of my keyboard, the area beyond the keys themselves, with temporary art glue, and stuck the top of the skin to it.  Bliss, nirvana, and a noted absence of bagel crumbs (and globs of mayonnaise) between my keys. Heartily recommended ... along with the temp glue. I've even removed mine, washed it by putting it into a jar half-full of soapy water and shaking it a half-dozen times, then rinsing, drying, and re-sticking. Works like a dream. (Check out art supplies for re-positionable spray glue.)

$review_text.: Maybe when they release a firmware some of these problems will be fixed, but at this point, avoid. Also, I do have plenty of experience setting up routers (hell, even my job sometimes requires me to set up enterprise-level Cisco routers in HyperTerminal), so I'm not exactly a newbie at this.My current router (a Netgear WPN-824) is connected with these devices:- My main desktop PC (wired)- My main laptop: Thinkpad + Dock (both wired and wireless)- A Linksys PAP2T VOIP adapter (wired)- A slate PC: Archos 9 (wireless)- A digital frame (wireless)- Another desktop PC in another room (wireless)- Another laptop, which again is used mainly in another room (wireless)The current router supports this configuration flawlessly. All I want to do is swap the router with this D-Link one.I have a DSL modem, and the PPPoE connection is on the modem (so, the DSL username/password are used only by the modem). I have connected this router to the modem using the router's "Dynamic IP" option (the one which it recommends for Cable Modems). This means that the router has nothing to do with the ISP; the modem deals with that. All the router is supposed to do is get the always-on internet connection from the modem and share it with the other devices.First of all, it is painfully hard to get the D-Link router to accept the internet connection from the modem. The modem works perfectly when directly connected to either the PC or any of my other routers (yes, I have several other routers), but it wouldn't work with this one. I would try to send a ping from the router interface and it would fail (meaning that the router itself wasn't getting an internet connection). After switching the modem multiple times between the PC and router and playing with the settings, I finally managed to get it to work. Oh, and if your modem has the same IP address as the router (192.168.0.1) make sure you change the router IP to something else, like 192.168.1.1, or else it won't work at all. This is supposed to be detected by the auto-setup wizard but it wasn't. Additionally, yesterday the power went out for a few second during a storm, and then it stopped working (devices would connect to the router but not the internet). After spending another 15 minutes of powering off/on the router/modem and changing their setting, I managed to get it to work again. The is disappointing as all my other routers work perfectly after power outages.Wireless connectivity is horrible. Getting the wireless devices to connect is easy. The problem is reliability. Every one or two hours connection will be lost for a few seconds. Sometimes it happens every 5 minutes for about an hour, and then switches to hourly dropouts. This is completely unacceptable. Again I changed every setting I could, but none of them fixed the connection drops.IP conflicts. Every once in a while a Windows dialog box will pop up on my wireless PCs telling me that there is an IP address conflict (another computer has the same IP address as the one with the message). Of course, internet will stop working until I disable/enable the wireless NIC.It's a first revision device (even its firmware is v1.00), so these issues *might* be fixed in the future. Unfortunately, switching to DD-WRT is not an option either, as it uses a Marvell chip.Avoid.
$SUMMARY.: Very, very unreliable
No DD-WRT support, and in serious need of a firmware upgrade.

$review_text.: Of all the various cases available for Android phones, this one for the Galaxy S2 is a bit different from the rest.It has an inner silicon sleeve which covers the back and sides of the phone to protect it (very effectively) from impact shock and vibration, and over this fits a really tough outer case made from ABS - a slightly rubberized plastic
The result is you can drop the phone on a concrete floor and it doesn't suffer damage.The case has snug-fit holes in exactly the right places for the camera, charging port, headphone socket, volume control and lock-button


Once the case is fitted on, the idea is that you never have to take it off.Downside:1
Expensive2


Missing a screen protector, a must-have to protect the most vulnerable part of the phone

It would have been nice if this accessory were included in the package: as it is, you need to buy a pack of transparent adhesive screen-protectors separately, so don't forget to order them too3


The case necessarily makes the phone slightly thicker and widerThe Galaxy is not a cheap phone, and you're unlikely to regret buying one of these truly excellent cases to help protect it - if you can stump up the price, which ain't cheap.

$review_text.: Purchased one of these, along with two e2000's


One of the e2000's crashed when loading the firmware
When this occurs with the e1000, e2000, or e300, the router cannot be reset and must be discarded (or returned)
I called Cisco technical support and spoke with Kashinath (#46193)
What a rude, unknowledgeable, tech

I hope the Cisco people read the dialog (printed at the bottom) to see how their customers are treated by their support people.So, here;s my fair-balance:PROs:Easy setup (when it works)Fast transfer speedsNice Guest Network feaureCON'sExpensiveDifficult to install complex networks (e.g
using two routers)Terrible technical supportTheir PC-based software must be in proximity to the wiresless device (e.g
if you connect using an RJ45 and the e3000 is out of wireless range, you must configure it "by hand"If you change some of the advanced settings, the PC-based software utility will not work and you can't easily access the guest network.Here is my dialog with technical support on the "e series" firmware issue I had:Kashinath (46193) has joined this session.Hello ! Welcome to Live Chat Cisco Support for Linksys Products

How may I help you?from me:I purchased an e2000 router


I downloaded the firmware update and the update generated an error message in the middle of the update


I cannot reset the router or access it.from Kashinath (46193) (privately):Are you trying to install the router or trying to upgrade the firmware?from me:Upgrade the firmware.from Kashinath (46193) (privately):What's the current firmware running on the router?from me:Whatever came with the unit


I think it was version 6

Since I cannot access the router anymore, I can't give you more information.from Kashinath (46193) (privately):I am afgraid there is no version 6from me:Whatever came with the router your company sold.from Kashinath (46193) (privately):Who is your ISP (Internet Service Provider)?from me:The ISP is irrelevant


I never got to the poin where I plugged it into the network.from Kashinath (46193) (privately):First we have to configure the router with yuor cable or DSL Modem according to the Internet Connection Type of the ISP.from me:You do not understand the problem

Can you please connect me with 2nd level support?from Kashinath (46193) (privately):No, not possibel because we do the firmware upgrade when there is any issue like wireless disconnection or frequent disconnection or any other performcanc based issue with the router, as you are conencted to some other network, you need to be on wired computer to the router in order to download and upgrade the firmware and you donlt know the current firmware on the router, then how would you assume that the router has old firmware?from me:i purchased three of these, all configured the same way


I take them out of the box, connect them to the PC and download the current firmware first


The firmware that comes with it is build 6 created in January of 2010

The current version is 1.01-Build 7, which is what I downloaded
It worked fine for the other two


This one crashed and is now inaccessible.from Kashinath (46193) (privately):All E2000 router come with the latest firmware.from me:No they dont

The e2000 had 1.0.01 BUILD 6


If you go to your website, and look for firmware updates, the current version 1.01 BUILD 7


This is what I downloaded.from Kashinath (46193) (privately):So , download the 1.01 build 7 


So go to our website connect the computer to the routyer using a cable and then access the router web set up page and upgrade the firmwarehere is the link:[...]from me:You still don't understand, I downloaded the file you mentioned, the file did NOT correctly load onto your router and the router crashed

IT IS NOT ACCESSIBLE .NO RESPONSE FOR SOME TIMEfrom me:THE ROUTER IS NOT ACCESSIBLE.from Kashinath (46193) (privately):if you have already download then connect that computer to the port # 1 on the router, then reset the router for 60 minutes using a paperclip
Thhen access the router set up page and upgrade the firmwarefrom me:OK, so you are saying that I push the reset button for SIXTY MINUTES (ONE HOUR)?That was the extent of the meaningful dialog with Cisco support! I returned the e2000 unit to Amazon but kept the e3000


I hope you have better luck!

$review_text.: I suppose it depends on what you like, but I have always enjoyed the ability to operate a radio controlled vehicle in a way that provides for precision and relaxation, and the Parrot AR.Drone is a more satisfying cross between controlling a sailboat and a lumbering glider-- my previous two favorites (a precision scale model of a B-17 darting about and doing loops, rolls and Immelman's just doesn't do it for me!).And it keeps getting better.FIRST INDOOR FLIGHTS:That it comes with an "indoor hull" was an indication of precision--sort of.  I bought my Drone after considerable research, but it was already dark when I got it.  At home, I could not wait to try it, so I did not wait.  As it hovered in my bedroom I became acquainted with its settings and controls, spinning it, taking off and landing on the box, and such, and enjoyed watching the video after.  On the second flight, my Drone and my bedside lampshade got into a terrible brawl.  The lampshade lost.  The Drone was fine.  That means something.Besides meaning that the Drone is tough and forgiving (and lampshades are neither), it also means that a bedroom is no place to fly.  For example, I have tried, but have never successfully directed mine out the bedroom door-- only about three inches wider than my Drone.  If I did not have furniture, I know I could do it; but Drones do not like passing over furniture.ANOTHER VERSION OF "INDOORS":I took my Drone to a gymnasium and made sure I set the controls to a very tame flight (before you take-off, you can set several parameters including maximum altitude, climb and descent rate, yaw rate, and more).  I flew up to each of my friends and hovered, flew to myself and reached out and pet it, then flew from one basketball goal to the next, targeted a small area to film on the scoreboard high overhead, and generally found I could make the Drone do whatever I wanted.Should I ever need to know-- from the video, I can tell that I will need a flat (bladed) screwdriver to change a light-bulb on that scoreboard high overhead.  Yeah, it is that good.OUTDOORS:Well... this is just great.I usually fly on a lacrosse field, and using standard control options (i.e., NOT the popular "Absolute Control" ability because I am used to flying R/C vehicles).  It is fast(-ish), maneuverable, forgiving, and even does tricks.  Today, for example, I met with a friend at the playing field who wanted to drive two of his R/C cars while I filmed them from my Drone.PLAY!:I chased his R/C cars from behind, manually coordinating speed, altitude, roll and yaw as he tried to shake me from his tail!  It was great fun trying to keep the camera on the cars as he changed directions and criss-crossed the field, and I had the occasional wind gust to add to the challenge.Last week, I wanted to see how high I could fly the Drone (131 feet on that breezy day) and to learn what could be seen from there, and enjoyed looking at the hills and skyline surrounding my flying area, but which cannot be seen from ground level.  A weekend earlier, I wanted to look closely at a nearby bell-tower, and so flew up to take a look...The point is, it is wonderful play.AND GROWING:Parrot also offers free virtual game (Augmented Reality, thus the "AR" in AR Drone) apps, and since the software interface is open-sourced, you will find many other uses are being discovered and available for download.TOUGH, BUT EASY AND CHEAP TO REPAIR (because, trees are often tougher):I am by no means an expert flyer.  All of my gliders have long since turned into "toothpicks" through crashes.  I have crashed my Drone probably thirty or more times in the four months I have owned it, but only once causing any damage.  I bent a shaft-- but it flew anyway, just not as well.  I bought a pack of four shafts, gears, and bearings (for about $14US, if I recall) at my local hobby shop and within five minutes had my Drone back like new.SUPPORT:My Drone has been perfect since I took it out of the box, but I read and contribute to their US online forum.Parrot is a French company and toys are not their primary objective-- and both of those show.They had a patent challenge in the US (probably frivolous) which forced them to briefly remove the popular (mostly with beginners) "Absolute Control" function.  Parrot, essentially, remained silent throughout the two months that the patent was settled while some users screamed, "Bloody murder!"One gets the sense that Parrot did not appreciate the frustration that their (legally valid) silence tactic created.  An American marketing company would likely have appeased many owners.And yet, just days before the happy return (for many, anyway-- I just shrugged) of Absolute Control, a new app (the first in-app purchase for them, called "Director Mode") was released adding even more function.  The Absolute Control Mode was re-released, and then the "Flight Recorder" add-on module started to become available-- all within about a week of each other, and all greatly increasing the play-ability of the AR.Drone.While the UK and the USA are the lion's share of the AR.Drone's market, we are still waiting for English documentation to become available for these new Parrot offerings.  That is typical of a tech-heavy company, and typical of a non-English-speaking company (I suspect French documentation is available).  The users, however, are often fans-- and so how-to videos, user mods, and even documentation for the apps spring forth from the growing AR.Drone owner population.SUMMARY:I am, eventually, going to be that "expert flyer" for two reasons.  1) because with this toy, I can crash as often as it takes until I can coordinate turns like the pros at the R/C airfields do; and 2) because it is fun to fly no matter my skill level.I get great videos, and it is easy and forgiving, so that I can (and do) hand my iPad Mini to a complete novice without fear.  They do not coordinate turns, but do not have to-- simply one axis at a time flying is how they get to learn.  When in doubt, simply remove thumbs from the screen and the Drone will hover in place.  If I was a little bit stingier, my friends would buy their own.  Oh yeah, they have an app for flying with a friend.  I should bring that up this weekend.

$review_text.: I liked the small footprint of this speaker dock and its portability. I really liked that it charged my iPod, had 4 speakers, had controls right on the unit. I loved the sound it put out for a speaker in this price range. I also loved that it had a remote that not only controlled volume and switching tracks and playlists but also accessed the menu button so I could go to other apps on my iPod. Seemingly the perfect speaker dock. Right? I read the good reviews and the bad. I have always been very easy on electronic equipment and when others get stuff that doesn't work right, I'm usually lucky and get stuff that works great. Then I wonder what the heck everyone was complaining about. So I ordered this. MISTAKE! MISTAKE! MISTAKE! After only 2 weeks it started turning itself off randomly. Sometimes after just one song, sometimes after a half hour or so. If you use the buttons on the top of the unit to turn it back on, they are very unresponsive. I had to bang on the ON button several times every time I had to turn it back on until my finger was starting to get kind of sore. It's as if the unit prefers to be off. At other times it just suddenly mutes the volume, even mid song and you have to turn it up. You can read the other reviews about how to try to reset it, how the buttons will break after a few months, how the remote stops working, how after a short time the non replaceable battery will hold less and less of a charge and your portable speakers are not longer portable. I believe it all! As another reviewer stated, all the good reviews are from people who haven't yet started experiencing these problem; their time will come. Thumbs down for Logitech. They know about all these problems. They should just recall the product. But then they would lose money.Buy this product only if you enjoy repacking purchases and taking them to the Post Office or have masochistic tendencies and are looking forward to trying to get warranty support from Logitech over their automated phone support system. (Be aware that most extended warranties do not cover problems with the remote control as it is an electronic accessory)Oh, I forgot a plus. The wall jack has a really nice wrap around feature to help keep your cords under control.
$SUMMARY.: Don't buy it, the bad reviews are true, you won't be the lucky one!

This camera is comfortable to use, easy to learn and with a bit of time, to master, and produces great results


Excellent color, and the unique night-focus and night-shot features work as advertised

Not cheap, but worth it for the serious amateur digital photographer
Wouldn't embarass a pro, either.

$REVIEW.: This is not a rating on this device particularly or the seller, I only posted three stars so as not to bring the sellers rating down for no reason. I ordered this for my Galaxy note 10.1 and expected it within the week, I received the email saying it would be almost a month, and it still didn't arrive until well after the &#34;delivery date&#34;. I purchased a full priced samsung adapter at my local Best Buy the next day. By the time I received the cable I'd already sold the tablet and haven't even opened this item. I was told by the seller when I tried to cancel the order that if I could wait it was coming from Hong Kong. I have no issue waiting for something if I really want it, but there were plenty of other ones that I could've purchased had I known I was going to have to wait for this thing to come from the other side of the world.

$REVIEW.: Constellation class drives are much pricier that their regular counterparts, but in this instance I was building a server, and data protection was paramount. When your data is at stake, its stupid to buy cheap drives for the most important part of the PC --your data! The extra features help to reduce false positives, and the energy savings make the server less expensive to run in the long run. Drives arrived extremely well packed and all 6 drives dropped right in without an issue. Very fast RAID performance. Happy with these drives. If they all live out their warranty, I'll have gotten more than my moneys worth.

$review_text.: I've known about Eneloop batteries for a while, but never bought them because of their price. A friend who's an amateur photographer convinced me they are worth the extra money so I bought them when the time to replace my old Phillips, Duracell and other brands came. I've had them for more than a year now (I wait a while before writing a review) and can say I'm grateful for the advice.They may not have the same electric charge (mAh) as other brands advertise, but these don't lose their charge when stored, or take way longer to. My old ones not rarely lost half of the charge after one or two months stored. These can keep it up longer.In the end, the lower individual charge is compensated. I just bought a few more than I used to have and now all my batteries are Eneloop (toothbrush, razor, remote controls, toys, etc...)

$review_text.: ***I'm updating my review because of the dreaded "Format Error"***I really liked this camera, and took really good care of it - I even bought the carrying case and always left it in there - but after only about thirty uses, it is broken.I recently got the dreaded "Format Error".  I hadn't used the camera for a while, so the battery was low.  I turned it on to film something and then got an error.  Now it doesn't work (it's not the card.  The card reads fine in my computer).  I liked it up until this point, but kind of feel ripped off that I only got a few uses out of it.  So I'm changing my opinion to "Junk" on this thing.  Below is my old review.-----------------------------------------------------------------I have to admit, I was a little puzzled by the range of reviews of this camera, so I thought I'd write about my experience to offer some clarity.The Sony Webbie is a small, cheap ($200 for a camera is relatively cheap) camera built for portability and uploading videos quickly to the Internet.Size - It's about as long as a pack of cigarettes and about a pack and a half wide.  Small enough to put in a coat pocket or big pants pocket, but a little cumbersome for jeans.  (still, it can be done)Ease of Use - "Easy" if you are familiar with a point-and-shoot cameraPicture Quality - For a small camera, I would say "good".  In low light, there is significant noise (little "dots" in the picture where the camera is having trouble distinguishing color, in this case, it makes a grid pattern and some of the images are a little dark)  but as the light gets better, so does the picture quality.Another weird phenomenom I've noticed is if you pan too fast, the top of the picture moves, and the bottom lines are about a fraction of a second behind and need to catch up.  (For example I was filming a tree, and I panned to the left and I could see points where the top of the tree had moved to the left and the bottom was still a little to the right and needed to "catch up" to the part on the left.)That being said, in medium to bright light the picture quality is pretty good.Auto Focus - Relatively fast, but if you're filming something fast, like a hyper dog running around the room, there will be times when it can't keep up.  (In this case, I didn't zoom in and just used a wider angle, and the picture was fine)Sound - I'll say "Decent".  Yes, when it's windy the microphone picks that sound up, and in quiet situations, you can hear the autofocus motor whirring.  But between those two extremes it does a decent job.Internet - Now this is where this device shines!  Recording in MP4 (h.264) format the file sizes are small and manageable.  That 30 second video you just recorded can be manipulated with software or uploaded to your favorite website in seconds.  There's no converting files or anything.  This is the main benefit of this camera, and something the people who are comparing this camera to the more expensive models are forgetting.  While they are maxing out their processors for hours trying to convert their videos from a proprietary Sony or Canon HD format, you can already be done and have your friends enjoying your videos.  This coupled with the fact that YouTube now offers software to add titles and stuff to your videos makes it all too easy.The Light on the Front - Really doesn't do too much at a distance, but is nice for a dark room at bout 1-2 ft. awayUSB cable - Doesn't charge the camera (?)Sony Software - Is okay, but I just use Quicktime to watch, and go to the MP root to retrieve the videosBattery Life - I think the manual says something like 90 minutes25 minutes at a time - Somebody else mentioned that this camera will only record 25 minute files.  So if you need to record something for an hour, it will shut off, and you will need to start recording again.Sony Cards - Are an expensive addition to the cost of your cheap camera.  An 8 GB card cost me $45 and allows me to record 4 hours of video (at 720p)*********My Opinion - If you want professional videos, image stabilization, low light recording, and attachable microphones for watching pristine HD videos on your TV, then this is not the camera for you.  Pick up a bulkier, more expensive camera with a bigger lens and all the bells and whistles.If, however, you want something relatively cheap, portable, easy to use, easy to upload to the Internet, that does not always take perfect pictures, then this is the camera for you.That's why I picked this camera.  Most of what I want a camera for is the Internet.  Some of the weaknesses of this camera I just work around.  If it doesn't film well in the dark, I turn on more lights.  The fact that it's portable lets me bring it to a party with little worry.  Try doing that with a big camera.After a week, I can say I really like this camera!

$review_text.: So, here's the thing.  I can see why many first time digital buyers love this unit.  There's a bundle of features that can make most anyone look like an experienced photographer.Among the best bells and whistles are: Face detection Only two AA batteries needed Continuous burst mode to capture several shots at once Lots of pre-programmed scene modes Big 2.5" screenBut there are a few Easter eggs that come with this package that make you feel like you got something extra, such as: Pretty good optical zoom for a unit this small Fairly decent customizing permitted in manual mode including contrast & sharpness Long shutter mode to capture night landscape or city view shotsI actually wouldn't make this my primary camera.  I prefer my Nikon D40 or Canon S5 IS when I plan on a dedicated afternoon of photography.  But I have been looking for a smaller pocket camera to keep near me for incidental and unexpected photo opportunities.So far I've taken about 1,000 photos and I feel like this is the perfect backup camera.  It has come in handy on a few outings and I've been very pleased with the results.There are a couple of things that I was not impressed with, but I can live with that considering that I wasn't really expecting perfection.  For example: Digital zoom beyond 12X rapidly degrades and becomes noisy The optical viewfinder is virtually useless since the image is fixed regardless of what zoom level or exposure setting I am using The Artificial Intelligence Auto Focus has a mind of its own because it sometimes picks an odd focal point so I just turn it off so that the focal point stays in the center while I manually set my focus where I want and then recompose - old school style.That said, this is a great camera with so much versatility built into it that it is hard to knock it too much.For my needs, I just wanted a reasonably reliable camera that is small enough to carry everywhere.  I just keep my settings at the highest resolution and compression mode and find that many pictures are equal or close to those I take with my more full featured units.It's a lot of fun and can be enjoyed by both inexperienced and experienced alike.
$SUMMARY.: Excellent back up camera when you don't want to bring your bigger camera

$REVIEW.: I purchased this to audit my office wireless network and it was well worth every penny. Using the Alfa AWUS036H I was able to decrypt our 128-bit WEP key within 45 minutes on the first attempt, and a mere 20 on the second attempt. I knew WEP was insecure, but even though the AP was set to use MAC address filtering and no broadcast SSID, I was able to collect enough information to decrypt the WEP key and authenticate to the network. Needless to say, the office wireless has since been upgraded with an access point that supports WPA-PSK2 with AES. WEP offers little to no security, and this device can help you prove that to anyone making purchasing decisions, or even to yourself if you're a skeptic.The Alfa AWUS036H is also good to carry around if you travel a lot and need the extra power and range (hotel wireless networks typically have a high noise threshold) to get a more stable signal. I use it with a 6 ft. USB extension cable to find the best location for signal reception. This device provides better reception than wireless adapters costing several dollars more and is an indispensable tool for wireless security auditing, I highly recommend it.NOTE: One thing that was not clear to me was what was contained in the package and this item does come with the suction cup holder, which is not a bonus item as another vendor's listing would seem to indicate.

I try to shoot in low light condition and D7000 ISO performance is very good. I go till 1600 and very less noise.Video performance also very good, I shoot stage program with low light next day of camera arrival. I did not have to learn a lot to do so. It is very easy to operate. Live view/Info buttons are my favorite. I had to fight with my d80 to check the settings at night, that problem is solved with this. One more good option is how you set continuous mode/single mode, easy dial (instead of small buttons as in d80)

$REVIEW.: The headline for this review may sound a bit extreme, but it actually did happen.I got this yesterday. I unplugged the USB connector for my old mouse and attempted to plug the USB connector for this mouse into the same port. It got about halfway before it got stuck. I did NOT force it in. I know how delicate USB ports can be sometimes, so when I realized it wasn't going in any farther, I attempted to remove it. It stuck. In order to remove it, I had to get a pair of pliers and pull it out... and out with it came the pins for the USB port.Moments later, my computer turned off.There was no pop or smoke or any of the normal indicators that come with a power supply going out, so I immediately feared that something happened to the motherboard. Sure enough, after doing some extensive testing, my motherboard is entirely unresponsive and looks to be dead. It would appear that the USB breaking shorted my motherboard.Unfortunately, because of plausible deniability, there's nothing I can really do to go after HDE to have them buy me a new motherboard, so I'm now going to be a few hundred dollars poorer (I know I could probably buy a low-end motherboard, but I'd like to have a decent PC, thanks) because of this POS. Needless to say, I was angry and took that anger out on this mouse, which is now dust in my garbage can. I would contact their customer service but, really, what are they going to do to help me? Nothing, so I'm just saving myself the headache.So, this mouse might be completely functional, but I will be staying far, far away from HDE from now on. I happen to be fortunate enough that I have multiple computers/laptops, but if you don't, I would be very wary of this product.

$review_text.: This is a first for our household.  I bought one of these for my wife for Xmas.  She loves it as does everyone else.  I let it cycle through several hundred pictures perpetually.  You can stick quite a few pics on a 2 GB SD card.  I would buy more of these although larger next time.  It would be nice if these were available with better looking frames (wood), an auto on/off as I have to turn it off every night and back on every morning.  I notice it has a speaker but I have no clue what for.  The manual wasn't much.  I would and have recommended this to almost anyone.  One pet peeve which I suspect is common to all photo frames is that it requires electricity.  So if you decide to hang it on the wall, you have an unsightly cord running down.  Perhaps someone makes on with a rechargeable LIon that lasts all month?

$REVIEW.: My trusty old plain silver HTPC case served me well, but I'd been looking for a newer model in black to match the other components, particularly the TV.  This case ended up being almost perfect.  To the extent you care (and if you live with someone who treats your HTPC endeavor on a scale from open hostility to benign indifference, you probably do), it looks great.  Clean, sharp, sleek for its size.On to the more important stuff.  There's plenty of space, plenty of fans, and plenty of vents. It comes with plenty of extra screws and other goodies for wire management. The vertical locking system used for hard drives may not be new, but it was new to me.  Works very well for those still rocking 3.5 inch non-SSD hard drives.  Case comes with two fans on the bottom, for cooling your hard drives.  That was also, for me anyway, a first.  A third pre-installed fan is housed on the right side of the case, right by the CPU on my motherboard.  There is room for one additional fan on the right, and some smaller fans on the back.  If you don't have enough fan headers on your motherboard, I'd suggest picking up some power adapters (if you don't already have them).  None are included.If you like to use many front-facing USB ports, be warned-only 2 available here.  They are of the USB 3.0 variety if you happen to rock a state of the art motherboard in your HTPC.  I ain't, so thankfully, there was an included adapter for connecting to legacy headers.Some other details about the front of the case.  While the LCDs are located behind the door, they do shine through a transparency out into your viewing world.  [EDIT: As pointed out by a commenter, to whom I am very grateful, there is a small dial on the bottom of the front panel that allows you to block the LED from shining through the front.]  [EDIT No. 2: Same commenter noted that there is a slider on the inside of the front panel that effectively disables the external power button--a much appreciated child-proofing feature.]Finally, the key.  Boy, does it feel flimsy.  I've never been accused of having the world's firmest handshake, but I feel like I could easily bend this key in half.  Something to keep in mind if you plan on opening the door often to load discs, connect devices, etc.  Keep in mind, the door won't stay closed unless it is locked, so you can't simply leave it unlocked and discard or disregard the key.These gripes are all rather minor [EDIT: and in at least 2 cases, my gripes were flat wrong, and corrected by a helpful comment], and I don't feel they warrant so much as a half-star deduction.  Great case, and I'm very happy with it.

$REVIEW.: I bought a pair of these on sale (from my "gold box" -- 10x50 is supposed to be the ideal for stargazing. I figured that this might come at the price of some chromatic distortion (tolerable) or difficulty focusing (intolerable). Last night was a "clear" night here in the South Bay. I live about a mile inland, on the coastal edge of Los Angeles' vast light pollution. No marine layer, and I quickly pulled the full moon into focus, then adjusted the other eye-piece. They work for me, but if my eyes get much worse ... I'll have to pass them on to somebody younger.Enough of the moon, already. I wanna see something I don't see on a regular basis. A quick scan of Orion showed some nebulosity visible, even above city lights. They feel steady. I'm looking forward to more star time.I didn't notice any chromatic aberation. I have only three minor complaints:1) No tripod socket for making sure that kids can see what you want them too see. No socket was promised ... so this is not a really fair complaint.2) Lens caps are cheap and tend to fall off. Watch out for them. It wouldn't have cost that much more to manufacture better lens caps--Bushnell ought to fix this one.3) I would have designed the adjustable lens with a broader range of diopters for those of us who don't quite see as well as we used to.All in all, a great pear of binocs for searching the night sky.

$REVIEW.: Despite it's rather hideous appearance, this mouse's performance is nothing short of stellar. It glides effortlessly on a good mouse pad. And the built-in sensitivity adjustments work great even without Logitech's software installed (on Vista at least). Forward and back buttons are intuitively placed and sized, so you'll be able to use them easily but won't do so on accident. The scroll wheel clicks as it moves, which is a little annoying, but functions well, again without having to install Logitech software (which I prefer not to).The shape is fairly standard and ergonomically solid. All in all a great mouse, especially for the relatively low price. I'm not a gamer but spend a lot of time at my PC, so I appreciate a good one.

$review_text.: After buying a couple of Play:5s I wanted to see if this would be OK for secondary zones (and to see if I could save a 100 bucks). It really sounds great, and holds its own against the Play:5 - the 5 has more bass and is a little more clear in a larger room (and at higher volume) but in a smaller room at lower volume the differences are very subtle.It integrated fine with my other Sonos systems, and with my all apple network - everything just worked.The real high point is the Sonos system - I spend a huge amount of time listening to Mog and Songza, and occasionally Tune In or my local library. The sound and streaming quality is great, and the controller app works fine. IT would be nice to have integrated airplay for things that Sonos does not have in the controller - but I hooked up and Airport express for that.If you have the cash, the 5 is a better product - but the 3 still sounds better than any iPhone speakers I have tried. The matte black is unobtrusive, and it blends in to the background. The integrated power supply (no wall wart) is really nice as well.

The feel of the keys is a bit &#34;clicky,&#34; as others have said, but for just thirty bucks I didn't expect perfection.  For my needs, it's right on the money.By the way, I write, and the keys keep up for me with no problems.  Essentially, it's those little tasks, like passwords, where finding the right key is important, that this keyboard excells.  I can keep the lights off and still see what I am doing.I'd highly recommend this for a good general keyboard that has the added benefit of lights.  And it gives my computer desk a very cool look, since my computer lights and keyboard are both now blue!David Lowe

I cannot use either the remote or the unit itself to do anything, including turn the unit off. I have to pull the plug. I've also noticed it stopping or skipping on one or two of the movies I recorded. I thought that it might relate to the Sony DVD discs I am using, but most movies I copy come out great.

I have even paid to update the maps and still they are wrong. Las Vegas is bad, but I've been all over and I have found errors with the maps in almost every state.The next problem with this unit is that is does not know where it is. It typically be off by about 300-600'. That's just ridiculous. I have searched on how to &#34;calibrate&#34; it, but so far no luck.My last complaint is that it's too slow. I'm driving the speed limit and I'm already ahead of where it thinks I am. It really needs a much faster processor.The functionality (menus, ergonomics, etc) is very good, but the navigation leaves a lot to be desired. Very often if we get off track it'll send me on a long way around to get back to where i should be instead of the most direct route. On the other hand, it has gotten me out of some crazy locations, so like I said, it's a love/hate relationship for me.

Even if you don't know much about photography, buying this camera for the price makes sense, because later on, when you wish you had a feature now that you know more, it will be there!If you are not "into" photography, simply use the AUTO mode, if you want a little more control it offers it, if you want full control, it offers it, even manual focus! With 9 mega-pixels, you can get huge photos that can be cropped and still print out very nice at 8X10 or 5X7! :)I love that the camera uses AA battery's and has memory card usage, so you can fill up a memory card, and pop in a new one

I am also VERY pleased with the video mode of this camera, it takes very good videos, that are better quality than my Nikon L3 or L4!The only small complaint about videos I have is that you can't zoom in or our while shooting, but that's ok, for the good quality, I'll deal with it! :)Overall, I love this camera and am having fun with it, and for the price, it totally satisfies me!

$REVIEW.: Traditional mice tend to need cleaning every now and then, and their ability to collect dust can make them very impratical. Optical mice are the solution to this problem.  They use optical sensors to track the movement of the mouse, eliminating the need for cleaning the mouse, and for a mousepad.Optical mice are great, and this is a great basic optical mouse.  The optical technology in this mouse is good.  The sensors track the movement of the mouse very well, and with good precision.  I have run some demanding programs, and this mouse seems to work fine within them.  The included Intellimouse software extends it capability, and makes the features customizeable.  It also lights up, which is a neat feature.Overall, it is a good place to start if you are looking for a basic, and inexpensive optical mouse.

$REVIEW.: I was really excited about getting this player, and bought it via Amazon on release day. I even paid the extra $3.99 on Amazon Prime to get it shipped next day.Opened the box and marvelled at how beautiful it was, then began the disappointment.It came shipped with beta firmware and was buggy as all get out. Internet was slow, music too soft and crappy sounding, video choppy, the whole UI was just clumsy and not at all fun to deal with.The engineers at Archos however have continued to release a fairly constant stream of firmware updates that have really started to make this player all that it has the potential to be.The improvements are too numerous to mention, but if you are interested you can see a history of them on Archos website, or the Archosfan user forum.I will just say that I am now very pleased to give this player 5 stars. I think it really is currently about 4.25, but I am hopeful that even more firmware updates will get it to 5 - it's pretty close right now.As of this writing the last firmware upgrade was 12/3/08.I would not hesitate to buy this if you are looking for an awesome multi function PMP device - well worth the investment.I don't think there is much else out there that will stack up to this device.

$review_text.: When purchasing anything under 40" in an HD flat screen, don't give a thought to the 720p vs. 1080p controversy.  The eye would never pick up the difference.  My wife was afraid this 32" would overwhelm the bedroom, so we settled on the Regza 26HL67U, which Amazon isn't even selling as of this writing, replacing it with the cheaper 26HL47U, which unlike the 67U series, comes without the Cinemotion feature for smoother action when watching films as opposed to video.Of the three flat-panels I've owned--Samsung, Sony and Toshiba--the Toshiba has a competitive picture (admittedly after some additional fine tuning), superior sound (no buzzing), greater versatility (3 HDMI outputs), and formatting solutions superior to the others, assuring undistorted figures whether the source material is 480p or 1060 i/p, and whether the aspect ratio is 4:3, 4:3 letterbox, or 16:9.  My Sony denies me use of the Natural mode when the set reads an upconverted signal as anything above 480p, resulting in flattened and fattened figures because of the automatic stretching of the image to fill the screen.  Toshiba has solved such problems (use Theater 1 setting for 480p signals and Theater 2 setting for 1060i/p signals).  Or if you prefer, use "Natural" mode and only part of the screen (the reason a bigger screen is so important) to insure exactly right proportions.As for a previous review about a broken screen, it's hard to see how attaching the tripod base (!?) could produce such a result.  The build quality of this unit, including the strong metal base and provided screws and wrench, is clearly superior to the Samsung, which offered rickety support by comparison.

$REVIEW.: Have this hooked up to a D-Link DIR-615 router.  Have already RMAed one extender, new replacement does the same thing.  Just eventually stops routing any device on the extender.  It's not a DNS issue, cannot route by IP either.  Suddenly just can't route and you have to power cycle the extender to resume routing.  Netgear just wants to keep RMAing it -- by the way, YOU have to pay shipping charges for RMAs.  There are long threads on the Netgear forums where this issue is widely reported, but Netgear has issued no firmware fixes for this issue or even acknowledged there is a problem.  I do not recommend this extender in any circumstance.+ Easy setup+ Strong signal strength- Stops routing, within 1 hour or 24 hours.  Often will stop routing about 3x day.  Have to reset it manually to resume functionality.- Support is worthless.  They just want to keep RMAing or will blame it on your router's settings.

I now have 2 other screen protectors for future use.The screen lands pretty flat on the Note II, to the point that it is almost invincible

I have yet to see it affect my screen sensitivity or clarity in any way


Stylus pen also works without any issues


Overall it's a great screen protector and you get 3 of them at such a low price.

$review_text.: I had a Garmin Nuvi 255w GPS and although I liked it for the most part, I always wondered why there weren't any GPS units with screens as large as what my wife has built into her SUV

So of course, I was surprised when I saw the Magellan 1700 GPS and purchased it shortly after seeing it

While there are some good things about it, overall Magellan could have done a better job
Here's my thoughts.The Good:The most obvious is the large screen

I also like the fact that you can view things in 2D or 3D
You can also zoom in to see less around but see what's near you in great detail or zoom out to see a ton of info around you


Also, it seems to do a very good job routing you where you want to go.The Not So Good:Let's start with the basics
There's a gigantic screen
PUT STUFF ON IT! The unit can show you how fast you're driving, your current driving direction, your elevation, the amount of time left to get to your destination, the time in which you'll reach your destination, etc


However, you have to toggle this information

Unbelievably, it only shows one of these things and if you want to see the others, you have to toggle

There is TONS of space to put all of this data


Why they cram all of this data into one little tiny area that you have to toggle is beyond me.Also, they take up a huge amount of space on the right hand side with a screen control to control the volume

Why this isn't tucked away in the settings is beyond me

I'm just flabbergasted at the poor screen management.This is a small one, but the text to speech voice is pretty horrible


For the most part, it's impossible to understand it
It doesn't matter because the chime letting you know when to turn is really good

However, for the most part the voice announcing the name of a street is pretty hard to understand.Another small one is when you're approaching a turn, I'm used to seeing progressions


1 mile away, 0.5 miles away, 0.1 miles away 500 ft away, etc., down to 0 ft away
With this unit, it doesn't go down further than 0.1 miles


Ok, no big deal


Again, you won't miss any turns with this unit

It's pretty good with that, so I can overlook this.No free map update - When I bought my Garmin Nuvi, it gave me one free map update


The Magellan doesn't


Uh...why not? This one's fairly annoying
Seriously, how hard would it be to put the stupid map on bittorent? They wouldn't even have the excuse of, "Oh, we have to keep our servers up for you to download the maps and that costs money." This is a cheap attempt to make money where they shouldn't be trying to


Magellan, people will eventually use their cell phones and this industry will be long gone
If you want to stay in the game, INNOVATE! Don't try and nickel and dime your customers.I also am not happy about the screen refresh rate during turns

When you make a turn, the screen doesn't fluidly rotate.So if you're looking at the screen as you're turning, for a second you'll be a little thrown until you realize the screen has been redrawn

It abruptly redraws the screen

This is just laziness on Magellan's part.Fine, you don't have traffic data

Are you seriously going to tell me that there's no speed limit data? For a $200+ GPS unit, speed limit data for major roads should have been included.My Garmin Nuvi had more routing options

For example, you could tell it to avoid unpaved roads

It seems that the Magellan doesn't have many routing options.The screen "can" create a blind spot if you don't put it in a good location
I spend a little time positioning it just right so that I didn't have that problem


HOWEVER, the windshield mount provided is inadequate because once you start driving and hitting bumps, the whole thing shakes like crazy


So bad that you can't read the screen


To solve the problem, I jammed it between the windshield and the dash
However, it's obvious this wasn't tested
If it was, the engineers would have realized that this big boy needs an extra stabilizer mount to keep it from shaking

It would have been very easy to do and wouldn't have cost more than a dollar or so

Just an extra suction cup for the top part of the unit.What I would also like:A compass

Most new smartphones have a compass in them


Why not dedicated GPS units? Sure, once you start moving, the device can figure out which direction you're moving and thus your direction

It's annoying when you ask for directions and the first direction is based on an assumption of which direction you're pointing


"Turn left at main street!" That's great, but my car is pointing in the other direction


I can make a u-turn, or I can just start driving and wait for it to auto-correct


I would prefer that I be given correct directions right from the beginning.Overall, I'm not happy with this unit and will probably sell it on eBay.

$review_text.: The idea behind this keyboard is excellent but the execution is really poor. The reasons:1 - As mentioned in other reviews, the slope of the screen in landscape mode is too vertical for any usage other than flat on a desk. Positioned on your lap I found it basically unuseable. Portrait mode is better but the swivel is not very stable and makes the whole thing feel like your ipad is going to fall over.2 - The case is not rigid enough for the lip around the keyboard to prevent the ipad screen from sliding a couple of millimeters left or right and falling onto the keyboard when closed.3 - I did not feel the ipad retention was very good. You basically snap the ipad into a thin bezel with little if any lip to it. I found the ipad would dislodge with very little pressure.4 - The lip that keeps the ipad in its sloped orientation is shallow and the case is flexible enough that the front edge can easily slip over it.The case itself is made of similar materials to my current Targus THZ157US-50, which I am using again, and is fairly good. The bluetooth worked as expected and required me to only enable it on the ipad for full functionality. The keyboard is a bit cramped for adult male hands but I sort of expected it and so don't really view that as a bad mark.My advice is to physically put your hands on one of these BEFORE buying it to see if these issues are deal breakers for you. I basically took the new case out of the packaging, tried it out for a frustrating hour, and then removed my ipad from the case and went back to using the above mentioned Targus case I already had.  The new case is sitting in my office closet now and I don't see myself using it at all.Overall, I'll chock this up to a learning experince from an otherwise good brand of accessories.

$review_text.: Ordered this cable and it came very quickly. I used it with some Samsung products and attempted to set up their Anynet network with a Samsung TV and a Samsung Home Theater set. HDMI 1.3 is required for Anynet. I could not get the TV to recognize the HT although ordinary features (sound and picture) worked fine with the cable. I ordered a more expensive cable that claims to be 1.3 compatible and sure enough I was instantly able to set up Anynet. My conclusion is that this cable is not 1.3 rated. If you just need HDMI and 1.3 is not important, the cable seems fine. If you need 1.3, steer clear of this cable.
$SUMMARY.: Not 1.3 HDMI as far as I can tell

$REVIEW.: To be clear, circular polarizers as a class provide you with functionality to get shots you might not be able to get any other way.  They can be used to increase the saturation of the sky or (my most common usage) to help cut through light bouncing off reflective surfaces (water or glass).  It's one of the few filters I think are still useful in the modern photographer's bag.There's nothing wrong with this filter.  It performed just fine for me.  Where it let me down was when it came time to put it on that first lens that didn't come with the camera kit.  Lenses come in different diameters, and this one is 58mm.  58mm is a very common size for entry level lenses, and can be found in some higher end lenses as well.  However, a much more common diameter for higher end lenses is 77mm.  So when you buy that next lens, you may find yourself needing to buy another circular polarizer as well.I would recommend buying a 77mm circular polarizer instead of this one, and then buy a 58mm-to-77mm step-up ring.  Given the increase in diameter the added thickness won't cause vignetting, and you'll have one filter you can use on almost any lens you may buy in the future.  Save money by only buying once, but do spend the money to buy the highest quality at the size you buy.
$SUMMARY.: Decent product, but you may be setting yourself up to buy another in the future

However, if one is on a budget and just needs a recorder for the requirements of the job or school, RCA's product is adequate.The pluses are the price, the compatability of the unit, the very informative manual, and the fact that there are four "folders" in which one can place his recordings.On the minus side, the volume setting could be stronger but a decent set of headphones will assist in hearing that which has been previously recorded.  The unit devours regular AAA batteries.  Because of the latter, an investment in rechargeable ones might be advisable.

$REVIEW.: Finally, a product that "fits with good form and function" as depicted.  This is my third cover for my MacBook Air - not an easy product to find a decent cover for! I was looking for something that wouldn't add a ton of weight, would be functional, would "fit" (close easily), would allow for dissipation of heat, but wouldn't be "slick and cheap-looking" - and THIS IS IT!  It has a nice "rubberized" finish on the outside, easy to hold (although it DOES pick up fingerprints easily - but they all do), fits very well on the Air, and protects it well, too!  It closes fine (stays open a little, but, what do you want, you're putting a cover on it) and it "looks good", not like some cheap piece of plastic.  Good value for the $$$.  You can see the Apple logo through it, if that matters to you (not as clear as they show on the picture).  Great openings on the sides for all ports.  No chipping, cracking or breaking like the other two plastic covers I bought before this one!  Dropped it (actually) from desktop height - NO DAMAGE.  That sold me even more. I've always had covers for my MacBooks (larger ones), usually they were Sp__K brand - but this one is tops!

We ditched cable and went to the web and this device has been our only controller for accessing media.Good build quality, like most Logitech devices. It's lighter than I expected, but still seems tough enough for not-clutz people to use for years.When I first received I was a little miffed that it had a proprietary USB link to the computer, I had been hoping for Bluetooth, but whatever. The dongle is tiny and has an incredible range, I cannot fault it for functionality. I can use the keyboard in the kitchen approximately 30ft away and through a wall without any impact to performance and accuracy (have a projector hitting a 10ft screen so I can see the mouse easily from that far).I really love the analog power switch by the mouse pad. it's super convenient and easy to use, and keeps unintended keyboard mashing from interrupting movie time..Haven't change batteries yet, which is an improvement over the last setup I had.Keyboard size is fine as long as you are already used to typing on a laptop or similar.I don't remember having to install any software to get the volume and home buttons to work.Good show Logitech.

$review_text.: I am a previous D200 and D70 owner.  Maybe it is that the controls are very similar but for whatever reason I am getting really stunning results with the D300.  It seems to have much better ability to evaluate the lighting conditions and come up with really nice tonality and color.  I am still working on the new focusing issues, but even without fully understanding it the results seem really good. Worth the upgrade.
$Helpful?.: [8, 9] $review_summary.: Extremely pleased and excited by D300 performance

$review_text.: This will be the first of several reviews:I couldn't resist any longer.I read the reviews and having long used a paper notebook at work during meetings to jot down notes (rather than typing as often I sketch), at first I was tempted to go to consider a tablet PC.  Not that tempted, they average $1200.  Then I considered carrying a graphics tablet linked to my laptop.  Well, the display of the laptop would have to be used, and all that equipment not so easy to tote around...My timing must have been perfect, as when I went online to see what I could get, I found the smart pen.  Or it found me.Being a skeptic, I was hesitant to invest $200 or even $150 into a pen...Well nearly 100 reviews on Amazon helped convinced me and I purchased the 1MB  model 3 days ago.  I figured since I would rarely record sound, I did not need the memory.The first thing that struck me with this product, was the amazing graphics.  The packaging is wonderfully done, the Quickstart guide; quite nice and the notebooks very well done.  Guys, you did your research.Regarding the industrial design of the pen, however I have some less than glowing feedback.  Not really bad, but some room for improvement.First of all I'm a Human Factors engineer. I have been tasked to evaluate ergonomics of handheld items, so am a bit sensitive to these aspects.The diameter of the pen using a scale comes in at 0.56 inch.  The ideal diameter should be about .25-.62 inch (see Woodson: Human Factors design handbook, 2nd edition, page 453), so it is at the high end of this measurement.  For me personally, though I have a fairly large hand, the pen is a bit big.Another thing, this pen is slippery and could use a rubberized sleeve, to keep it from sliding in my hands.  Given that it is large to start with, maybe the finish could be altered instead.  Maybe the offset pen nib contributed to the pen pivoting a lot in my hand.Since this pen cost me $150, I'm very concerned with its safety.  Since it is completely cylindrical, I spend a lot of time trying to keep it from rolling off my desk.  How about a pen clip, to minimize that?Additionally for those of us who have gotten used to gel pens, I was a bit worried that the conventional ink in this pen, would introduce more drag.  When I have switched to conventional ball point pens,  I have found my keyboard-trained hands have had issues with the drag on the pen tip, which caused fatigue. I'm happy to say, even though I have recently transcribed 20 pages worth of notes, it has not proven to be an issue.  Luckily, I'm not likely due to do that many pages in one sitting again.Length of ink cartridge, provides a pause. I have not ran a cartridge dry yet, but I am concerned this will happen quickly, rendering my expensive new tool inoperable, given how short they are.  I can't comment on this as yet, but I am concerned, that it will be an issue.Onto the software.The software loaded uneventfully, which is a good thing, but since I goofed and did not hook up the USB with the pen in the dock, when the screen told me to and hit Next, I created a bit of a glitch.  The computer could not find the pen. I realized the issue and placed the pen in the dock and hit Next, but it still could not find the pen.  Rebooting quickly fixed this however.  It concerned me that it was that fragile, but was a minor issue and due to my own mistake, so I am a bit forgiving in this regard.My pen required a firmware update when I first linked it up and this took about 5-7 minutes.  I know firmware updates can be hairy so I was very careful not to disturb the pen, especially in light of my earlier goof.I have not played with the software much yet, but found the instant appearance of my pages on the computer quite nice with each docking of the pen.  It appears that it also transfers these files as well.  Nice!  I have tentatively tried the search and it recognized my hen scratching quite well. Fantastic, as this is why I wanted to have my notebook electronic.I'm not quite understanding the software well just yet. I was hoping it was a bit more intuitive, but I have yet to give it a real test drive as yet.  That will be my next review.So far, I'm keeping the pen...Please note...though I am a "Vine Voice", I did not receive this pen, through this program.  I bought it at Target.I'M BACK: AFTER OVER 100 PAGES.This is my second review in as many months on this product.I'm still impressed, but some of my earlier comments, still hold true as well.1. The pen diameter is too large.2. The surface of the pen is too slippery.3. Without a pen clip, the pen has a tendency to roll off a desk.But, I'm sure you want to hear the new stuff.INK CARTRIDGE LASTED A LONG TIME:The initial ink cartridge ran out after 64 pages of the starter book.  That is 64 sides of 8.5" X 11" sheets.  I don't think that is too shabby.INK CARTRIDGES NOT EASY TO REMOVE WITHOUT THE BASE:However, even though the pen case has room for two ink cartridges, you really cannot change these cartridges on the fly very easily. I definitely needed the base to pull out the expired cartridge. This meant, I had 15 minutes of meeting notes to take without my pen...OUCH!  I would suggest a surface on the carrying case able to extract a cartridge.CARTRIDGE CARRY CASE, SHOULD HAVE A CLIP:I find the carrying case to be only marginally helpful. I protects the pen nib and can hold two cartridges.  But a clip to hold it to one of the books would be nice too.SOFTWARE NOTES:Now that I have used the software more, I'm very pleased.I have over 100 pages of notes and I can find stuff quickly and easily.  Search is relatively accurate; much depends on how bad your writing is. Creating a pdf of your pages is simple, even exporting audio files is easy. Surprising too is how much stuff fits on the pen. I have not had to remove anything from the pen since I bought it. That's over 100 pages of notes. Mind you, I only have about 4-5 hours of audio. I bet that really eats up the memory, but still my pen is less than 1/3 full.The few times I have used the recording function it was to be sure the details of a discussion were properly recorded.  So that is what I literally did. It was a means of supplementing my notes. However it provided the secondary option of catching a colleague up on a meeting they could not attend. I also could easily give him pdfs of all my notes as well. How cool is that?LEGALITIES OF RECORDING:Some issues have come up, that I'm not sure how use of this pen can address.There was some concern about "recording" meetings without telling someone a recording was being made.  Not something done to be deliberately sneaky, but done as a matter of course to be accurate.HOW TO RECORD DURING A CONFERENCE CALL:Another is the reverse concern on how to record a conference call. Many of my meetings are virtual. Some I would have liked to have recorded.Today I ordered some more ink cartridges and the next set of books I plan on using.When using this pen, I have extolled it's virtues to a number of colleagues, who all seem to agree this is a great idea. What amazes me, is that I have not seen anyone else with this device yet besides myself?
$SUMMARY.: After one month, still all is good.

$REVIEW.: I've spent too much time working and playing with tablets of all brands. I bought this on sale after taking just half a glance at the specs. The processing power is excellent. Sketchbook, photoshop, NFS games.. You name it, it will run it without stuttering or lagging. I'm very impressed! The screen is nice and bright. Quite usable in daylight, and to the point of blinding when it's in a dark environment. The rubberized coating also has a premium product feel to it.I'd like to note that being 8 inches is probably the best thing about the device. It's perfectly small, perfectly large. You can put it in your pocket (I carry mine in my inside jacket pocket). You don't have that feeling like the screen is too small, like on a 7 inch.&#34;One inch makes a huge difference.&#34; - She

$REVIEW.: This notebook is extremely great


This is the first Mac I have owned, but have been using them for quite some time since I'm a graphic design student


This notebook clearly shines even over the PowerMac G5's in my university's labs

With 2GB RAM, a 2.33GHz processor and a 120GB hard-drive, I'm well set for quite a few years to come.Anyways, onto the review.Screen: The screen is great! Nice and bright and I love having the widescreen with 1440x900 resolution


I can really fit alot of things on the screen nicely
Also, with the DVI port on the side of the laptop, I could connect my 19" Dell UltraSharp monitor, and now I have dual-screens

You simply plug in the included DVI to VGA adaptor and configure settings for each monitor


From here, you can drag things right off the MacBook Pro's screen right over to your 2nd monitor
I've seen alot of bad reviews for the included adaptor...however mine works perfectly fine and have never had a problem

Users with problems may have a cruddy monitor or are just doing something wrong.Speed: This notebook is QUICK

I've seen alot of horrid reviews when using software such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash, etc
I use all of the Adobe software CONSTANTLY, and I haven't had many problems that can't be solved with simply saving more often


Every once in awhile Photoshop or Illustrator might crash depending on what I'm doing...but it is rare


Once CS3 comes out, there won't be ANY problems what-so-ever


Every day I work having Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash, iTunes, Safari and iChat opened, and it hardly ever makes the computer struggle to support all of this load


My last computer was a SONY VIAO with 1GB Ram and a 2.8GHz processor


It would have never been able to handle this high of a workload, but the MacBook Pro succeeds.Appearance: This thing is slick
The nice aluminum case looks very sophisticated and is constructed very smoothly


I purchased a Speck clear-plastic clip on case to prevent scratching to the aluminum since once its scratched, theres no fixing it

Anyways, The keyboard is very nice, the keys feel excellent when typing

I really like having the 2-finger support of the touch pad when I don't have a mouse handy


The backlit keyboard is also very nice for working in the dark or with low-lighting
You simply choose how bright/dim you want the keys to be with F9 and F10
The Super Drive located in the front of the notebook is more convenient than slide-out units on the side


Also, having the Apple Remote to activate front row with the sensor on the front of the laptop is great....simply sit on the couch with the remote and you can go through your iTunes music, movies, dvds,etc

The speakers in the notebook sound very impressive for most notebooks


Very clear, crisp sounds.Complaints: One complaint I have is the heat

This thing does get pretty toasty sometimes under heavy workloads causing the fans to kick in


However, I downloaded SMC FanControl and set the fans to 3500rpm, so the fans consistently keep the CPU cool...around 116 degrees fahrenheit


Without this, fans will jump up to around 6000rpm when the CPU reaches 125 degrees fahrenheit.Another gripe I have is that sometimes when in sleep mode, the computer doesn't know what to do
Its rare, but it still happens

When I try to wake up the computer, it takes a few tries till it will bring up the window to let me log back in


Sometimes it'll even shut-off or restart when in sleep


Very odd
Once again, SAVE SAVE SAVE your work.Overall I'm very happy with this purchase...but then again for 2500.00 I'd better be
I ordered directly from Apple to take advantage of the $200 college discount.

$REVIEW.: The power conditioner reputation has gotten out of hand

Overpriced for what it is? Maybe but not by much


If you think about it, quality surge protectors cost $40, this costs $120

But you are getting a lot more.Build quality - Speakers will last you 20 or more years, same with dedicated amps

Line conditioner/surge protector, hopefully 10+ years assuming no major electrical issues

On items I expect to keep, I want them solidly built
These monster devices are more solid than 95% of A/V components out there

Technology is not going to change much on these so they are not really disposable like most components except the ones mentioned
A/V receivers, BDP's? 3 years if you're lucky with the changing technology

The HTS 1600 is all metal and heavy


People have disassembled and noted the quality inside as well

By comparison, my streamers and BDP's are lightweight, plastic pieces of s***e that I fully expect to break in 3 years

But again, they are built that way because they will be obsolete before they break, or so manufacturers expect

Sadly, that expensive TV we all just bought probably has 7 years before obsolescence

I miss the days when all components had feet and were standard rack size and didn't have rubber knobs glued on as "feet", but I digress.Price - Not speaking for the higher end Monster power conditioners, but for $120, this is not that much more than a vanilla surge protector in terms of dollars (not %)


People pay more all the time for "luxury" items like cars, jewelry, haircuts, speakers, A/V cabinets, etc
It's all in the eye of the beholder
To be clear, this is a luxury item for most of us (without regular power issues) as opposed to a home theater necessity.Appearance - this looks like it belongs in your rack, and will continue to do so for years


For me, it cleaned up the wires behind my entertainment center


I only have audio cables and a single power line going into the wall

People pay a lot for clean A/V centers

This only costs $120

I used to have 2 power strips and a jungle of wires behind


This is mainly why I bought this, as an in-rack power strip.Line conditioning - I never had noticeable interference and I don't live in an area with lightning or brownout issues, so I can't say that I NEEDED this
I don't notice a difference now, but I never expected to given my power situation

However, it's surprising how others judge people who do have power issues and notice a difference

Some improvements are more noticeable than others (picture interference), but no one seems to judge people who spend 5x more on speakers for a subjective, marginal improvement
This is acceptable with audiophiles however


Also, there is peace of mind with the insurance
Everyone's power situation is different, and unless you have tested in every house, I think it's inappropriate to judge IMO.Other Pros - Although not negatively impacting as far as I can tell, I do have older wiring in my mid-century house
I like seeing the voltage meter fluctuations just as an FYI


I have always been a little paranoid about the power although I don't have definitive evidence that it affects my audio


I did have a receiver die inexplicably so it could've been the power
My point is, my suspicions can now be validated with the volt meter and/or protected against
Another pro, the 8 outlets is about right for a typical home theater
The closeness of the outlets is not an issue with adapters (same issue with most strips).Cons - Besides this being a little on the pricey side, the display is also a con


There is no way to dim it or turn it off
I suppose I will get used to the brightness at night or cover it up at some point if it gets annoying.Overall, I am clearly on the buy it side of the argument
But, I don't think its a MUST have item for every situation
Then again, most people have a few nice to have items

We all could have gotten by with the cheaper TV or speakers, but we chose not to

Buy this
(or don't)

$REVIEW.: THE BAD: If you don't already know what touch wiz is, it's the "skin" that Samsung unfortunately puts over top of Android and it's a resource hog
 If you've ever tried pure Google Android via one of the Nexus devices or a rooted rom on some other device then you know what I'm talking about


 Right out of the box this tablet stutters, Web pages load poorly and it gets stuck/freezes up before opening programs


 I took a gamble on buying this especially since there are other tablets out there for significantly less that run Android so much better.THE GOOD: The screen is absolutely beautiful,  it's full HD and it's 12.2 inches, no other screen comes closer
 It's a lot thinner then I would have expected and very light for its size

 The internals are top notch, and it has potential to be a great tablet.Bottom line is if you could get rid of touch wiz I would say buy this tablet, there are enough apps on android to replace your windows laptop and go primarily to Android, but the Tab Pro misses the mark

 And for how much you have to pay for the Tab Pro, there are other, cheaper tablets out there that get the job done much better than this one.UPDATE 04/09/2014: I returned the tablet a week after purchasing it

 It was not worth it, I used that money to preorder a Samsung Chromebook 2, so they will still get my money, just $200 less of it.I said it in the comments, give me the option to install/uninstall the apps I want, I keep the tablet and give it a 4 or 5 star review.And for those who seem to not like my review, sorry, not sorry.

$REVIEW.: I bought this case for my TomTom VIA 1505M WTE GPS

 The case is able to fit in the GPS with the mount, the USB cable and theUSB car charger( you need to place the USB connection wire and the car charger underneath the GPS in order to fit the bag )
 The case is made of a material that is semi-hard

 In other words, it is not a hard case but mid-way between one made of a flexible fabric and a sollid hard material, such as hard plastic or metal
 So you can squeeze the case somewhat and fit it into tight space in your luggage bag
 Craftmanship of the CaseLogic case is good


 All in all, very please with the case.



$SUMMARY.: Excellent GPS Case

$REVIEW.: This 3to1 Composite AV cable is a great plug in for when you don't have enough plugs on the back of your main device - to keep all of your devices plugged in.  By using this cable unit, I don't have to keep going to the back of my HDTV to plug in or unplug the cable to a game that I want to play. I like everything to stay plugged in, but powered off when not in use - and then I just Switch On this cable unit when I am ready to play 1 of my 3 games and select the corresponding game/cable I want to play.

$REVIEW.: This Samsung Blu-ray player with wifi can really irritate your nerves. I have it hooked to a lcd Samsung digital tv to look at Netflix & Youtube. Everything seems to work fine with the two together. They are in my bedroom and I dont look at the tv often. But if we have a blackout or power surge, no matter how gentle, it will knock out the code and I have to retype the code in the system again from the dsl box b/f I can watch Netflix or Youtube. My daughter bought me a Panasonic Blu-ray player for Christmas that we use often in the living room and we don't have that problem with it when their is a power outage or power surge. That is why I am giving Samsung Blu-ray player 3 stars. Samsung should have fixed this problem with this product b/f placing on the market for consumers. I wish I had just bought Panasonic Blu-ray player with wifi enabled like I was given for Christmas gift.

$review_text.: English-speaking Cobra Radar/Laser Detector is truly one of the best, bar none! While relatively easy to operate and comprehend, this device is recommended for city dwellers and highway travelers alike.After opening the package and viewing the sophisticated electronics, we dreaded having to spend lots of time reading the operation manual; however, this was not the case. After roughly 22 minutes of reading, probing, and mounting the unit on our dashboard, the device was ready to go.  Note that the product includes fixtures for optional windshield mounting too, but dashboard operation seemed more agreeable to avoid having the required power cord dangling above.The four buttons are pleasantly minimal with settings for:* City or Highway* Dimness or brightness (via OLED technology = Organic Light Emitting Diode)* Mute* Power on/off with volume control* Menu for further optional programmingMute is a good feature when using this device with a normal GPS system; both sound and image are dually indicated. However, the unit includes an audio jack if one desires to connect to a speaker for sound amplification.  Plus, using the Mute control, one may view additional features, such as the vehicle's actual voltage read from the cigarette lighter, which provides a 'low battery' warning; and there is a programmable compass; display of numeric longitude and latitude (via the GPS), and much more.The Global Positioning System addition is brilliant, but we wished it provided directions like ordinary GPS's. This one detects new and existing photo enforcements; caution areas; speed alerts; programmable user location alerts, updatable GPS database information and more. Perhaps in the future, drivers will have all of these features worldwide - including telephone and email capability all-in-one.We did not experience false alerts in our tested urban and suburban area. For example, there were warnings for speed indicator units (warning drivers to be cognizant of their speed); law enforcement vehicles in transit (note that "parked" unattended units generated no alert); regular (non-cargo) trains did not alert; however, regular rails like AM-Trak picked up signals.  At the local international airport, the device did not beep constantly, but rather it alerted us correctly when obvious vehicles were nearby.  Note that in the city, we had unclear alerts, but realized there are often "unmarked" vehicles that aren't so obvious. With Intellimute technology, the system worked as expected. In fact, Cobra knows if our vehicle is moving slowly or stopped; it detects and displays RPM and may be programmed with Activation Points.The only potential downside is the laser's need for 360 degree view of the vehicle's surroundings. If the laser is obstructed by object(s) or severe foul weather (i.e. dense rain, snow, smoke, or fog), such Acts of God may prevent its operation. Also, the alerts only speak, "K Alert" or "Ka Alert" and few others; therefore, one must read the manual to decipher the alert code.Thus far, Cobra XRS 9960G is fully legal in all 50 states.

Set up seems very easy - he was able to program and use the watch within an hour of starting to read the booklet.  It seems to wear nice and stands up well to sweat.  I purchased this version over others as reviews say it is easier to use with sweaty hands, and so far there have been no complaints.One tip - when you put on the heart monitor, you must wet the band to get good contact.  Other than that, it seems very wear and go!  GPS picks up well in our neighborhood, and the computer interface has kept my husband very busy monitoring his progress.

My house stereo which puts out about 100WX2 is thumping them nice. Yes I actually use them to replace house speakers haha. There cheaper and look nicer overall if U ask me then most house speakers. there pretty lite, magnet is not really huge. About the same as the cone U see there, maybe just a bit fatter. But hey if your trying to go cheap and need a quick nice looking replacement, these are it, especially if your not looking to rattling your windows out haha. I don't think they'll get that far. There pretty stiff too, just to let y'all know. There not as flexible as they look, and the ones I got have a darker yet shiner blue on em, w/o the lines.

It has youtube magic such as auto movie mode, auto HD action etc.  It makes viewing youtube so much more fun.  I am 73 years old.  I rely on youtube for all international entertainment not available from main stream.  This Chrome box is perfect for viewing youtube.  I would rate this five star plus.10/23/2012 updateAfter extensive test and use I now love my chrome box even more.  For those who just bought the Chrome box you may not realize that the  Chrome box can support three TVs at the same time technically.  This is not mentioned in the instruction.  However, a look at the outlet at the back one realizes that there is one DVI and two displayport outlets.  All of them can be connected to TVs simueltaneously.  All you need are the right digital cables.  I invested in three cables display port to HDMI and DVI to HDMI.  With these cables I am now connected to three TVs in my large living room.  I can sit in the rocking chair and watch TV on my desk or across the room.  With a wireless track ball I recently purchased through Amazon I can remotely control all three TVs without leaving the comfort of my rocking chair.

I have an opportunity to test this out before buying

When I was testing it at the shop using my sony d50 as player, I got the feeling 'Wow'
This is the sound i want


Its a little bit on bright side, making sound sweeter, with less amount of bass so that the sound would not be muffled and the bass was of very high quality
It gives a very balanced sound


The sound stage, though wide for closed headphone, would not be as good as open headphones but I dont listen to classical music


It could also be driven by portable devices
This might possibly be the last headphone that I bought as I cant fond one better than T5p yet.

$review_text.: I have tried numerous consumer-oriented IP cameras, but this is the first pro-style model I have tried. I know from experience with multiple other cameras that these cameras usually start out as professional models, or are made by professional surveillance companies, and are adapted for the consumer market. When that happens, the packaging and marketing text makes it sound like it is easy to get them up and running by the average user, but it is a veneer that wears off once you start trying to set it up. Q-See does fall into that category, but they executed the setup process better than most I have tried. The bottom line is, I ended up getting everything to work as advertised with less frustration.Pros:1) They try to make it easier for the average user with large installation posters with a lot of photo illustrations2) The automatic setup software actually worked, for once3) Cameras provide a nice field of view4) Appears to be well made and designed to weather the elements5) Night vision is usable6) Overall, they succeed in avoiding requiring the user to buy a networking dictionary, but you still need to dig a little to understand some terminology7) Viewing IP cameras on a smartphone has been one of the biggest challenges I have had with IP cameras. Some I have tried simply never worked, even though the manufacturer says it's possible. Others I have gotten to work for reasons I cannot explain. The best thing I can say about this product is that I can view the cameras over my smartphone, so I'm not going to push my luck. However, the apps they provide apparently give many peoples issues (see Cons below)Cons:1) Instructions are still not as easy as I think they need to be for the average user. While parts of the instructions were easy to understand and follow, they did not necessarily flow from one thing to the next. I am really not sure how I got everything working. Seems like I jumped around between instruction sheets and steps. I also had to do some searching on their web site. I had to install several pieces of software and drivers, but I'm not quite sure yet what they are for, or how to work them. I doubt I could guide someone else through how to set it up. Still, somehow, I got it to work2) While the automatic setup software worked for me, if it doesn't for you, then you are thrown into the daunting world of port forwarding! This is something all other IP cameras I have used I have had to deal with. Digging into your router's settings is not the most user friendly process3) The consumer friendly veneer wears off the deeper you go. The more you go into the settings sections, the more it looks like territory only a security or network professional could love. Still, like I mention in the Pros section, they do abetter job of explaining than other products I have used4) There is no wireless anything on this product. For the sake of security, everything is wired. This means you have to figure out where you want your cameras and then determine if there is a place for the dvr to go that allows all the wires to be connected. Of course, you have to run the wires to and fro, meaning you may need to get on the roof. The dvr also needs to be hard wired to your network, otherwise you need to connect it to a TV or monitor. I think most people are going to want to use it on their desktop and/or smartphone, though. This, then, requires the dvr to be connected to the network. I ended up placing the dvr in the loft space in my garage. I connected it to the network using powerline adapters. It worked5) When setting it up, you need to see a screen of some sort. The way I did it was I temporarily moved my dvr to near my desktop and plugged my computer monitor into it. This allowed me to follow the setup screen instructions to set up port forwarding. Once that is done, you can move the dvr back to where you want it. Then, I was able to use the viewing software on my computer to continue setup and monitor the cameras6) The smartphone software they provide is confusing. They have a lot of different versions and it is hard to figure out which one to use. The only way I figured it out was by going to their web site, searching for android apps, inputting some info and finding the exact app for me. The only other issue with the apps is that the viewer ratings for most of theirs is very poor. It worked on my phone, but it looks like many people have some major issuesSo, basically, I can say this: So far, so good. These cameras look and perform like high end security cameras, compared to the plastic cased, over-styled consumer IP cameras I have been using. Despite a lot of little things to assemble and setup, I did actually get the system to work as advertised with a lot less frustration that other IP cameras I have used. As a first step into a pro-style security camera setup, I believe the Q-See system is a good start for the average user, as long as you are willing to invest the time and effort needed to set it up, i.e., it's still not simple and easy.

$REVIEW.: The WD Livewire Powerline sets up very easily, works well right out of the box. Thru-put is not what's advertised but house wiring has a whooo-le lot to do with it. If you don't have perfect wiring, you'll never get the advertised bandwidth. The supplied very short electrical and ethernet cables would indicate that the boxes are supposed to sit almost on top of the connected devices and within a few feet of the wall outlet (at the same time). This is probably an impossible task for most AV setups. I imagine that adding an extension cord or longer ethernet cable degrades the signal, but some of us will have no choice. At this point I don't use my Blu-ray for downloading movies and the TV has rudimentary internet features, so the WD Livewire satisfies my needs. I'll update when I start using my Blu-ray to download and watch movies.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this for my daughter. She has an ASUS laptop and the onboard cooling fan went out completely. It was out of warranty at the time so fixing it would have required a new motherboard, and cost more than the laptop was now worth. We decided to read some reviews and buy a good cooling pad to get as much life from the ASUS as possible. It's STILL in service today thanks to this pad.My daughter tells me that when she's doing something on the laptop that is VERY processor-intensive, the system can still get kinda warm, but remember, her internal fan isn't working AT ALL. That is to be expected. If you're adding some cooling power to an internal fan that IS working, this pad should keep your system absolutely COLD!

The "pen point" is a rubber button, soft enough not to damage the screen, shaped to be more accurate than your finger in tapping points on the Kindle screen.The color of this stylus is a matte silver, which is very attractive. It is very light weight. If you find that tapping the touchscreen is inaccurate (I have trouble especially getting the home icon to appear when in full screen mode) or if you don't like fingerprints on your Kindle screen, this is a very handy item to add to your Kindle accessories.

$REVIEW.: I converted my LaserJet 5MP (what a workhorse!) to wireless with this unit


 It communicates well with the Ubuntu and Windows Vista laptops in the house
 Wireless printing is much more convenient than print sharing since you don't have to turn on an extra machine to act as a server.The documentation could be better and you need a Windows computer (or WINE) to get this running because the web interface doesn't work out of the box
 But it's been running fine for weeks now that I've installed it.I haven't had a problem with signal strength at all and my printer is upstairs while my computer is often downstairs.I would recommend this adapter with the caveat that it's easy to set up if you know the basics of home networks
 From the other reviews and comments, I'd say that if you don't know what an IP address is or how to install a networked printer on your OS, you might want to look elsewhere for something simpler to install.

$REVIEW.: I have a set of the original version of the Yongnuo RF-603 triggers. The addition of a functional &#34;test&#34; button to this version II for measuring light with a light meter made it worth buying for me. Works great with the build in triggers in my Yongnuo 560 III flashes.Highly recommend this trigger for simplicity of use and reliabilty. I haven't had a single misfire with this set or my old set of the version ! triggers. I don't use my PocketWizards in the field any more. These triggers paired with 2 Vivitar 285HV flashes and 4 Yongnuo 560 III flashes make for a light and versatile location lighting kit for me.

I have a MacBook Pro 2.53GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Mid-2009 laptop and I just tried to use this onto its Digital Output. Not only did my Mac not recognise it, but it worked nowhere else where this was needed. Considering how useless it already was, I thought about going ahead and returning it. Apparently, Recoton doesn't think that's going to happen either and made sure of it.Putting it on was pretty easy; removing it literally renders it as "unreturnable." You could only imagine how many chew marks I had to put to take it off. One thing is for sure... the only time, and I mean the ONLY time, I will ever use this again is if someone gave me a free Toslink cable so that I can put this permanently on, show people how much of a pain this product is, and advocate that these should never exist and things should either be full-sized or non-existent at all for products like this.(I now need to seek dental assistance because it hurts in my mouth right now.)

$REVIEW.: The battery works as advertised.  It's bigger and heavier than my laptop's standard battery, but I knew that going in so I'm not going to blame it for that.  In case you didn't realize, the case of this battery bulges out approximately a half inch to accommodate the extra cells.  Assuming the battery compartment is towards the back of your laptop, the effect is to raise the back of the laptop, tilting the keyboard forward slightly (an improvement, IMO).I've had the battery about two weeks and it's worked fine.

$REVIEW.: I just bought my Fuji Finepix HS10 less than a week ago while on a trip to Vegas. I added a few filters (UV and a circular polarizer). When initially testing shots, they were very clear, all the way through the fully extended 720 mm. After adding the filters, I was having an impossible time getting anything but muddled shots at the fully extended range, though it worked fine when bringing the lens back to around 500 mm. No matter what settings I tried, hand held nor tripod mounted, I could NOT get anything but junk at 720 mm. I was in very close contact with FUJI support on this, and they were very responsive, suggesting alternative settings, etc.  Nothing worked. I then thought about the additional filters and could THAT be the cause of the problem. I took off both the UV and circular polarizer ... PROBLEM TOTALLY SOLVED! I had beautiful/clear pics at 720 mm, and hand held was no problem whatsoever. I then added the UV filter (BOWER), still clear as a bell. Adding the circular polarizer (BOWER) brought the problem back immediately. Turning the cp filter had no effect, still lousy ... really lousy ... results at 720 mm. Those of us who bought this thing wanted that 30X range, and not having it caused me intense frustration at first. I have read the reviews here, and apparently more than one person has gone through this. TAKE THE CP FILTER OFF! That should bring you the camera you thought you were buying in the first place.Now: the BRAND of CP FILTER might also be the culprit here, I don't know. Perhaps a better grade cp filter might be the answer if you want to employ a cp filter ...I did not rate the various sub-categories here since I have not used the camera enough to comment with any experience. The same applies to my giving the camera a four, not five, star rating ... not enough use. Since solving my 30X problem, I will run this beast through its paces again, feeling a heck of a lot better now that I know it's not a defect in the camera.BTW:  FUJI has just come out with an update to the firmware, you can find it at:  [...]Regards,  Mike McCaffrey

cat6a doesn't support 100GbE speeds, but rather increases the bandwith to reduce crosstalk (interference from other cables).I really like the ends and how they're metallic and click very nicely
My pack had no duds so I am pleased.This cable is compatible with cat5, cat5e, and of course cat6.Yes, I'm aware that cat7 cables do exist, but they're not yet fully certified at the time of this writing, so this is your best bet if you want to ensure being future proof.

$REVIEW.: Worth $10-$12 or so.  These are just what you pay for.  They are not a great bargain, but neither are they cheap junk.  For an every day carry or knock around in the car or Jeep, just perfect.  When you lose them or your kid drops them in the lake, no big deal, just buy a new pair.Two suggestions:  Buy the 8X25; it is a lot easier to get past the limitations and the 10X25 is hard to keep in focus.  Also, don't look through a good pair of binoculars or you will instantly be $200-$300 poorer.  I have German glass.  You won't ever want to look through them without a large credit balance and an understanding spouse.  I worked extensively with optics and lenses years ago and the more you learn and experience, the more it costs you.  And not just a little bit.  To get that last bit of quality out of lenses cost 2-3 times as much.Trust me, you are better off not knowing what you are missing.

$review_text.: If you are looking to spend this kind of money on earbuds, I assume your main interest is the sound quality.  I can safely say that after having sampled over twenty earbuds from the $10 to $100 range that these are by far the best sounding earbuds I have ever worn. I was beyond impressed with the clear and full sound; I was amazed that I was getting this sound from earbuds.  I had resigned myself to never getting high quality sound from earbuds and just making do.  These have proven that assumption wrong.  This alone would make these worth the price.In addition to the sound quality, I noticed that the volume is significantly louder than other sets of earbuds--even with the volume set the same on my iPod.  In fact, the volume was similar to the levels I get with my Sony over the ear headphones that I use with my stereo.  In fact, overall the sound was quite comparable to a mid-range over the ear headphone--again, something I never imagined possible with earbuds.The next thing that most impressed me was the stabilizers tips (called StayHear tips) that come with the earbuds.  Once you work out the correct size (they come with three sizes) for your ear, these keep the earbuds in place and help them fit comfortable in the ear like no other earbuds or tips before them.  They don't feel as tight as other earbuds I have used.  However, they stay in place far better than other brands.  This is precisely where they excel other brands: remaining in place without significant discomfort.  This has proven excellent for me when I am out exercising.  I no longer have to reposition the earbuds throughout my exercise; they remain in place for the entire time.The only drawback to these earbuds might be the price.  However, I am assuming that anyone who really wants the sound these are capable of producing would not hesitate to spend the money on them instead of buying pair after pair of throwaway earphones.  Plus, I am convinced that once anyone listens to these they will realize how good music can sound from an MP3 player.  So, I recommend these highly to anyone who appreciates exceptional sound quality and needs comfortable earbuds that stay in place.

Getting any screen protector on without bubbles can be a problem, but having a larger screen actually made the application easier.  My wife held the screen protector on the edges and I used the squeegee to apply the screen protector.  Only one noticeable bubble at the very edge of the Thrive (not on the screen area).You still get noticeable fingerprints and smudges, but it takes longer for them to become a nuisance.  I appreciate the fact that there were three screen protectors in the pack, but I will probably misplace them before I need to apply another protector.

$REVIEW.: I just recently went to Costa Rica for vacation, and it happened to be rainy season. On top of that, I planned on doing some beach trips and trying out white water rafting while I was there. The point is, I knew I was going to need a better camera than my old Canon Powershot. Something ruggedized and waterproof. I didn't have a lot of time to do product research beforehand, so I just went to the nearest dept. store and asked to see their waterproof cameras. Of the limited selection I found, I was most impressed with the Pentax Optio WG. It was weird-looking, but its capabilities seemed promising, so I decided to go out on a limb and give it a try. I'm happy to report that I'm VERY glad I did. It is a GREAT all-around camera. And I definitely took it through the paces. It withstood rain, jungle hikes, ATV rides (also in the rain), river rafting, beach snorkeling, drops and dings, and even hot springs. The best part is, I got some really great shots while doing all of this. It has a multitude of settings, from landscape to underwater to panorama and about two dozen others. I definitely noticed a change in quality when I found a more suitable setting for my different surrondings, so I'm glad that the settings actually made a difference, unlike some cameras I've tried in the past. Even the some of the macro shots managed to surprise me with how sharp and detailed they were (On a sidenote, I appreciate that they ringed the lens with tiny LEDS to enhance the quality of close-ups - I initially thought they were just a stylized design with no real function)Now, a word about my criticisms. I really don't have too much to complain about. I found that the panorama function was difficult to use sometimes, but only because it requires a very steady and measured sweep of whatever you're taking a picture of. Basically, if you want to use this function successfully, you'll need a tripod or a steady surface you'll be able to rotate your camera on. Lastly, be careful around high heat. I spent some time in Panama boating around, and we were in the sun the entire time. After about an hour, I noticed the back display screen was starting to fog and show impressions of high heat. I immediately took the camera out of the sun and the distortion went away. Some people might consider that a major defect, but to be fair, it was 95, the camera is black, and it was being used in direct sunlight for a prolonged time over highly-reflective water (Basically, a really HOT situation). That only happened once though, and afterwards, I was more careful about putting it around extreme temps.Overrall, I was very pleased with the performance of this camera. Granted, it's no dSLR, but it's the perfect camera for anyone with a sense of adventure and an active lifestyle.

$REVIEW.: This review presumes the following - if inapplicable to you, maybe this is not the right review for you:1. You've previously been using Windows 7 or XP and are reasonably comfortable using computers, but not a big "gamer," "techie" or in an IT department.2. You have not previously used Windows 8. In fact, you are a little apprehensive about any new operating system based on past experience.3. You are considering purchasing an HP Envy Phoenix h9-1330.As of the date of this review, it is virtually certain that someone buying this PC will have to adapt to both the new hardware and the Windows 8 interface. If you qualify under the three presumptions listed above, you may be uncertain which factors relate to the hardware, and which to the new operating system. Accordingly, I am reviewing them together - I am no techie either, and uncertain in some areas on the dividing line between hardware/software challenges.Short answers for you:1. My initial impression is that the hardware performs exceptionally well and processes data exceptionally rapidly.2.  Windows 8 is probably the weirdest operating system Microsoft has ever rolled out on an unsuspecting public, but let's face it you are going to have to work with it sooner or later and the exceptional initial weirdness can be mastered in a few days.3. For reasons apparent later in the review, it is strongly recommended that you download either a free version or $5 version of a Start button the nature which is already familiar to you.Let's start with the computer itself. I'm in the first 2 weeks of using this computer, and I hope to update this review as I learn more about the good, the bad and the weird. If you are as mediocre-technical on computers as I am, there are a few curves to be navigated in the setup to use your existing monitor with a new PC. Me? I am replacing a two-year-old Gateway SX 2810 that ran Windows 7. Let's just say that if the experience was satisfactory, I would not be replacing a two-year-old PC. But the monitor was working just fine, as did all the attached hardware (keyboard, mouse, printers and scanners, auxiliary speakers).There is a high probability that your existing monitor has a VGA connection to the PC, standard until recently. You will notice that the PC does not have any port that fits your monitor. The extremely minimal instructions provided with your new PC state:  "A DUI to VGA adapter is required for monitors with a VGA connection." The instructions do not note that the required adapter is actually included (although unlabeled and relatively mysterious).  Unless the Random Hardware Elves singled me out, the required adapter is probably included in the box you received. If you're anything like me, when you see random, unlabeled pieces of hardware in the box, you figure the instructions will probably mention something about where and how to deploy them. So before you run off to your computer parts supplier of choice, check to see whether there is a random piece of hardware either still in your box or laying on the floor when you pulled out the contents.Getting nervous about the "extremely minimal instructions?" They do mention prominently all sorts of videos and user guides that you can pull from HP's Internet site to help set up and use the new PC. Of course, if you are unaware that you actually have the required adapter, you will be unable to connect your monitor to this PC, rendering any video assistance moot.  HP: This seems easy enough to correct.  Perhaps you could label the adapter, or tuck some helpful note into the instruction booklet.In any event, after clearing the hurdle of attaching my monitor, the PC itself is excellent (so far). The keyboard and mouse supplied are, of course hardwired. If you are queasy about unnecessary wires restricting movement, getting bound up, and complicating access to the rear panel for other attachments, you probably want to use a wireless keyboard and mouse. If you have concerns about the compatibility of all sorts of stuff with Windows 8, you may be pleasantly surprised to discover that hardware used in the Windows 7 environment works just fine.  Hey, I haven't tested everything but my wireless keyboard, wireless mouse, hardwired printer- scanner and wireless printer-scanner all work as before.As you might hope, this PC processes and downloads data really fast. Software downloads zipped through much faster than my past experience.  After getting just about everything set up, moving about 100 GB of music and working with the computer for a few days, the startup/boot time from "off" (not standby or sleeping) was 20 seconds.  So if long boot times have scared you away from complete shutdown when you're done using PCs, feel free to get as green as you want - 20 seconds is nothing, so shut it down and save a tree.I have docked this product one star for needlessly problematic instructions, but I have not had any other problems unrelated to the Windows 8 software (I think).  The software is a whole 'nother story.  If this was a review of Windows 8 as a standalone product, I'd give it perhaps 2 stars.So, how about that Windows 8, huh? I will presume that the following eccentricities prominently noted on the Internet are Windows 8 software issues, not PC hardware issues. Of course, if you meet the three criteria I started with, it makes no difference to you.In the setup process (a.k.a., the World of the Thousand Screens), there are a number of fields where you must type data in a typical white fields sometimes including wording such as "example." If you are as clueless as I am, let me save you some time here - you cannot put the cursor in the next field and erase the word "example." It will disappear when you start typing, and often you do not actually need to set your cursor in the field. This degree of automation would be bracingly delightful if you knew it was coming. Areas requiring insertion of telephone numbers do not require you to insert the prefix 1 or the dashes between area code and phone number fields. Did I say do not require? What I meant to say was you cannot do it even if you try.Okay, this is for the geezers - remember that huge ad campaign involving the song "Start Me Up?" Was it Windows 98 or Windows XP? No matter, it was a big deal that you could do so many wonderful things and go so many magical places by hitting the Start button. You would think that they paid the Rolling Stones enough money to keep that feature as a central integral part of Windows software. You would be wrong, since Windows 8 has no Start button. Need to restart the computer to finish installing some software? Moving the cursor to the magical lower left-hand corner of the screen will not yield start, shutdown, restart, run or any of the things we've grown accustomed to seeing.No start button? Okay, we all know that nobody wants you to power down rather than properly shutdown or restart, so there must be something in the extremely limited manual that at least tells you how to do that, right? So as you are paging through the manual and get to the section "Setting up multiple displays," you probably figure you missed it. Maybe I missed it, but it appears that after the manual tells you how to set up 2 monitors or even 3 monitors is the first helpful note mentioning something how to restart the PC.  So if you have your computer on, and cannot for the life of you figure out how to restart it or shut it down, there is a very helpful section in "Troubleshooting" on the topic: "Computer does not start." How cool is that? The one thing you do not want to do - start your computer - is where you find how to do all the other stuff. Go figure, the Start button is gone but your old friends Ctrl-alt-delete are the path to salvation. All you have to do is hold down the 3 amigos Ctrl-alt-delete and select the "Power icon", and then select "restart." Power icon? It's that thing glowing on the top of your PC when you turned it on, except now a matching icon (without subtitle) appears at the lower right-hand corner of your screen.  Concerned that when you hover your cursor over it, it looks like the only option available is "shutdown?" Concerned that if you do that, it's as bad as reaching over to the glowing start button on your PC and screwing up everything on your new computer? Fear not, when you stop hovering and actually make the leap of faith, clicking the icon allows your PC to shutdown, restart or sleep. When I start drafting user manuals inserted with hardware like this, I promise I will specifically mention something like that long before I tell you how to set up three monitors.So you have set up your new PC, attached the monitor and started the puppy up. The new welcome/start screen on Windows 8 is a bit disturbing at first. Rather than wallpaper and icons, there are a dizzying array of "tiles," some of which change by the second. Activating any of them by mouse click causes that task to fill up your entire screen. No comforting task bar at the bottom, no apparent way to minimize the screen, and you already know there's no start button.  There should be a button on your keyboard with the Windows logo that looks a bit like a waving flag. It will be your best friend now. Pressing the Windows key takes you from the Start Screen of Numerous Tiles to the desktop screen. If you have activated one of those weird live tiles, the Windows button will get you out of there too.Okay, one more random weirdness issue on Windows 8 and that's it until the next update.  There are lots of reasons to reach the "Control Panel" function.  Is it one of the tiles on your start screen? No. Can you reach it from the start button on desktop? No, there is no start button. So go back to the Start Screen of Numerous Tiles. Type the letter C, just like it says in the extremely limited manual. Okay, but where? There is no open field, no place with text like "example" that will magically disappear when you type something. So where do you type that? Anywhere on the start screen.  Doing so will take you to a screen of apps. Apps? That doesn't start with a C. No, but it will bring you to a screen of apps "Results for C." One of those is Control Panel. Another is Microsoft Solitaire Collection. Doesn't it start with M? Sure, but the word "collection" starts with C.  Scott Adams should get royalties, some of this looks like a scheme devised by Dogbert.So, as noted way toward the beginning of this review, do yourself a favor and download a start button to facilitate the functions commonly known as Start, Shut Down, Restart & Run. There are free versions that may have a bit of spyware, and there are $5 versions with less spyware or perhaps even none. Internet searches for Windows 8 start button will yield plenty of options. While you're at it, surf the `net for all sorts of feedback and corrective software that may or may not ease your transition to W8.  Good luck.

$review_text.: Hello Everyone,So, I took the advice of my good friend and purchased this combo set. I'm glad I did BUT there are a couple of things you should know. First off, if you live in an area with a LOT of CB buddies you may find that the keyboard and mouse act funny at times. This is because they run on the 27 MHz band and if you're close enough to a CBer running some wattage, you can get inference. Also, note that NOT ALL BACK-UP SOFTWARE WILL SUPPORT WIRELESS USB MICE. I'm running Acronics True Image myself which supports such devices but, if you run Norton Ghost, Watch out!All this being said, I find the keyboard and mouse work very well and would purchase them again. Hey, give them a try for yourself, if you don't like them I'm sure Amazon will take it back and set ya straight.....they're good like that.Ciao!

$REVIEW.: I was a slow convert to the iPods. I had previously bought one flash memory mp3 player from Creative. While that device worked OK, it only had 256 MB which severely cramped the amount of music I could take with me. I liked the Creative player OK. It was easy to use, and sounded great. However, there was one major pain in the [...] about it: low battery life. In order to get the device so small, Creative opted to use a single AAA battery, and I was always having to change them, eventually breaking the little door that slid over the battery compartment. Their design team would have done better if they had opted to use a AA battery instead for a much longer battery life, and the device would not have been much larger. Anyway, enough about the Creative. My review is about the iPod Nano 2GB Silver (2nd Gen).The iPod is hands down the BEST music device for the money you can buy. Great battery life, easy to use interface, and plain sexy. But just as important as the device itself, is the software you use on your computer to interface with the player. In this regard, iTunes is so freakin' good, I've been recommending it to my friends that don't even have iPods. One caveat: on some older PC's or cheaper ones (Dell Optiplex where I work), I get a burn error of "4450" when I try to burn certain playlists to CD - and no one has a fix or a suggestion as to why. Some blogs said it was media related, but I use branded HP, TDK, Maxell, and Sony CD-Rs, and still get the error, so I suspect it may be related to the motherboard chip sets or drivers. I've never had the problem at home.Some friends asked why I didn't get the 4 or 8 GB Nano instead of the 2 GB. Well, compared to my 256 MB previous player, 2 GB was a heck of a lot more. And I got this player to be treated a bit rough - I use it for working out, traveling on the road, jogging, and other activities. So to be honest, I didn't want to spend too much on a player only to kill it in the first two years of its life. Now that I'm so satisfied with the Nano, I may spring for a hard drive based video iPod later on to carry nearly all of my CD collection around. But really, 2 GB is plenty of music for me (around 25 CDs), and it is easy to sync and change the music content whenever you want.The only thing I could ask for to improve the iPod Nano would be wireless recharging, which I'm sure is in the works for the future sometime (see Popular Science for April).So the bottom line is, if you want an easy to use player that doesn't have to be babied like a hard disk based one, then the iPod Nano is your baby.A worthy competitor might be the Creative Nano Plus, but once again, the use of a single AAA battery, and the lack of support for .m4a (.mp4) files turned me against the Creative and steered me toward the iPod Nano.The Digital Rights Management system used by iTunes wasn't really a factor in my purchase, as I rarely buy anything from iTunes, but instead, just rip my own CDs. In any event, you could always burn a CD from your bought playlists and re-rip them to get rid of the DRM if you want. You could even use CD-RW's and reuse them, so you don't fill up the local landfill with burned CDs.

$review_text.: functionally, it works great...however I returned it after using it for 5 minutes
 I use several other mouses and they happen to be all logitech mouses
 as soon as I picked this connectland mouse up...something was different

 It was really really slippery and I could not get a good grip on it

 And that is the major difference and something I could not get past

 All Logitech mouses have that rubber/ergonomic feature to it on the sides


 The rubber gripping on the sides just makes using the mouse and sliding and moving it around 100% easier.So, if you're used to having the rubber grips on the sides of your mouse...this Connectland mouse might not be a good fit.Just my two cents


 To each his/her own

 I just wanted to clarify...it's all plastic all around


 Gripping the mouse or just trying to move it became akward difficult


 I even went as far as putting grips on the sides and just said forget it, i'm returning it and buying another Logitech that has the rubber grips on the sides.I AM NOT trying pushing Logitech...any mouse with rubber grips on the sides will likely get the job done...just what i've happen to find to be really awesome mouses


 I bought the Logitech M450 Nano Mouse

$review_text.: I was eye shopping in a local camera store yesterday when I came across this belt pouch. On my recently acquired Think Tank Pro Speed Belt V.2, I envisioned how this pouch could be so useful in many ways. The price was cheaper than Amazon, so I quickly grabbed the last one in the store.The pouch is made of top quality materials in typical Think Tank care in design and thoroughness with just the right number of internal and external pockets. In the main compartment are dividers so small lenses can be stored without damaging each other. With the dividers out, it can house a pro-DSLR body with the lens detached. In the main front zipper are dedicated pockets for pen, memory cards and such, as well as a lanyard with a clip for keys or the Pixel Pocket Rocket. Another zipper in front of this can store your cell phone or any other flat object, such as a small notebook, etc. Inside the bottom zipper is tethered rain cover, the Think Tank's signature inclusion in all of their bags and pouches. Because I was shopping for a case for carrying two spare batteries, I was delighted to find that this pouch has external dual sleeves for such items.This bag has so much to offer in such a small pouch that it's up to your imagination as to what goes inside. A small loop on each side of the pouch can be used for transforming this pouch into a shoulder bag, too, if you don't want to attach this to your belt. A highly versatile pouch, indeed!

I did not think i was going to get the kind of sound that i did.Purchased mine in october 2011 for $359Pros:Plays mp3/divx/xvidStick a 32 gig stick in and drive across the country...never hear the same song twice.able to match the color of the screen and buttons to my cars green theme.mounted the back usb port to the front of my dash. doubles as a power/recharge port.Cons:Shuffle algorithm for random play is horrible.Reflection on the screen in daytime play makes the video unsee-able... but, i dont think that it is the units fault.NO ANDROID SUPPORT...so tired of everything being "i" this and "i" that support, not everyone is a ifanboy.Unable to turn shuffle on and off from the remote.Full id3 tag does not scroll for the song/album info.When downloading videos from the net to view on this unit, you may need to convert them. using " any video converter " here are my settings.xvid480x272bit: 1024framerate 23.976makes the video fit perfect but will crop older 4:3 formats.

$REVIEW.: I *like* the smallness and relative lack of features on this radio

Other satellite radios we have owned had too many features -- we could never find the station we wanted! This design lets you scroll through categories, scroll through stations, pick five presets, and that's all
Perfect!If sound quality is at all important to you, I don't recommend the "Power Connect" installation
There is no way to avoid FM interference


But if you have a car radio that lacks an input jack, Power Connect does what it's designed to do: provides an inexpensive way to get your satellite fix without a hardware upgrade.How to run the wire from the receiver to the antenna without creating an ugly mess on the roof perplexes me, I admit.--A day later..
"Power Connect" is worse than I thought


So bad, XM really shouldn't advertise it

I had the radio wired into the car at a shop for $100
So this wasn't quite the inexpensive solution I thought it was, but now I have really good sound.

Luckily we are not beginners so they were easy to set up and use.The good; Tons of options


very stable, needs very few restarts (other than the wireless)

Site to site VPN works great, never drops

Good features and great price

Firewall is very robust and you can feel safe using it.The bad; The wireless is inconstant


Sometimes you cant connect even if you are 4 feet away.The SSL vpn is very inconstant

Many errors in the log about http auth, etc
Seems to have a mind of it's own.Support has gone downhill
You have to pay each year for updated firmware


They are slow to respond, and sometimes it seems we know more about the unit than they do.For hardwired firewall protection, this thing is great
If you want the rest of it to work, good luck

We will probably not be buying anymore.

$REVIEW.: While this appears to be a good router with quick, straightforward setup (even manually), it may not be the best choice where there's a significant mix of legacy 802.11b equipment on the network.I originally bought this router because of its dual-band, dual-radio capability, and its backward compatibility. I have a home theater system with wireless rear speakers, and it and my legacy 802.11b home network -- both on the same frequency -- frequently conflicted. I thought moving some devices near the wireless home theater speakers to the N band and keeping others at solely g/b on the second radio would be a good solution. The router's documentation indicates it has this capability, and its impressively flexible configuration software confirmed it.Unfortunately, after several hours working with this router, it turned out there were two problems in my specific situation:1) It didn't play well with my older, purely 802.11b adapters. I have two of these on desktop systems. Even when selecting basic WEP encryption for the g/b network, the router refused to connect to these historic Microsoft-brand adapters. The older adapters could see the new network, but could not be validated to connect even by re-entering the WEP key several times and several reboots. And there was no error message to indicate what might be wrong. However, signal strength on the g/b network was excellent.2) Pure-N band signal strength. I was lucky to get one bar out of five for the pure-N, unmixed network; that was no more than 25 feet away from the router. And I have no conflicting cordless phones. But I also had no pure-N adapters, and that may have been a factor in the weak N strength.Because of the apparent poor N signal strength and its inability to play nice with legacy (almost historic) b equipment in my configuration, it turns out this router is not a good alternative to my ancient-but-trusty all-802.11b network, even though four of the six devices on the network are 802.11g capable. (I'll probably move to a more proven and much less expensive 802.11g router as the next step, even with the wireless speaker interference issues, while waiting for the next generation of draft-N or dual-radio routers to upgrade my entire network, including all adapters.)That said, the router's setup and instructions were straightforward even when the setup wizard failed; I was able to easily configure the router manually due to excellent integrated help and the well-written manual. The pre-g backward compatibility and potential N signal strength issues, though, make this router a no-go for me.

$review_text.: I was a bit nervous about ordering the Universal remote because of my Roku player.  However, it couldn't be simpler to program.The Universal remote has a Select/Scroll wheel and Fast Forward/Rewind controls that correspond perfectly to my Roku remote.  I merely pointed each remote at each other and pressed a "learning" button on the Universal remote.  I then pressed the button on the Universal remote that I wanted to use as Fast Forward and the Fast Forward button on the Roku remote.  Since there are only 9 buttons on the Roku remote, I repeated this step for each of the 9 buttons.The instructions that came with the Universal remote are great.  I can now do everything I could do with my Roku, such as select, search, etc.  I have an older Roku player without an SD card slot, which I think the new Roku players have - so the Universal will not be able to accept an SD card . . . still worth it in my book.Plus, the Universal remote has a button that will illuminate all of the keys, so now I can see what I'm pressing in the dark.  No more pressing Channel Up (which switches my TV from the Roku player to broadcast TV) when I really want to press Volume Up.Not bad for under twenty bucks.

$REVIEW.: PROS: This repeater does what it is supposed to do, which is extend the reach of the WiFi signal from your main router.  Our house is not particlarly large (I do wish I had a 5,000 square foot home, like some of the reviewers seem to have), but the problem we encountered is that one of the prior owners had built an extension, and between the extension and the main house was an exterior wall.  For some reason, the main router's signal did not do a good job of penetrating that exterior (now interior) wall to provide coverage into the extension.  I mean there was some coverage, but streaming video from, let's say, Hulu Plus was really annoying.  You had to move the computer so many times and had to perform so many crazy tricks that it harkened back to the days (and I am dating myself here) when people used to put tin foil on the TV antennas (does anyone remember those?) and hold them in their hands to watch the news.  It was THAT bad.This repeater has eliminated that problem completely.  Not only does my HP running Windows 7 receive a perfectly fine signal (5 bars), but my wife's MacBook Pro also gets a rather strong signal now (alternates between 4 and 5 bars when before it received none) and my friend's iPad (which probably has the worst wireless card of the three) also gets internet access in the extension.Set up was surprisingly easy.  I am not a techie, but I followed the instructions and was up and running in about ten minutes.  No calls to technical support were needed, and if you follow the instructions on a Windows 7 computer, you will be just fine.  To repeat, I was very pleasantly surprised with how easy this was to set up after just following the instructions.CONS: So why four stars?  Well, the Hulu Plus streaming works pretty well, but if I am streaming in HD (720), there will be at least one hang up during the show.  Then you wait for about half a minute and then it resets and you are fine.  Not that big of a deal, but annoying nevertheless, there should be no hang ups at all.  If you set it at ED (420), there are no hang ups, but the picture is slightly fuzzier, so there is a trade off I'd rather not make.Another thing is that the security on this repeater is slightly lower than that of the main server.  Usually I get them confused, but one is WEP and the other is WPA, and I think that this repeater has the lower security.  While this usually is a non-issue, if you are streaming program such as MS Office onto your computer from a secured site, it would not stream properly, or at least it didn't for me as I kept getting corrupted files.  This problem seemed to be resolved when I brought the computer over to a place where it could receive a signal from the main router.So, there you have it, a very nice repeater, with a couple of things to consider.  For me, at this price, after looking at what's available in the market at this price range, it seems like the issues that this repeater may have (which are occassional and minimal) are somewhat easier to live with than those of other repeaters that cost the same or more, but that decision is up to you.Best of luck to you with your shopping.

$review_text.: I've been usingWD My Passport Ultra 2TBdrives to meet the backup needs for several of my clients' for a while

They are fast, reliable and compact

The My Passport Slim is essentially a My Passport Ultra in a slightly smaller and lighter package that is very attractive.The Passport Slim became of interest when a client asked for a very portable external drive to take on the road where size and weight are especially important
The Passport Slim 2TB seemed a good fit for his purchase.The Slim is "sexy and sleek" as it has been described in other reviews


It's about 1/8 inch thinner than theWD My Passport Ultraand just about 1/3 of an ounce lighter.Like the Ultra it comes with a short cable, soft draw-string bag and has WD Smartware Pro on the drive for easy backup and sync to/from Dropbox (their "automatic cloud backup")
This Passport Slim drive was not purchased mainly for backup
It was intended to carry media, reference materials and work files on the road and as storage to off-load pictures.The first add-on purchase was a longerUSB 3.0 Type A to Micro-B Cable
These are 3ft long which is perfect for reaching over a mini-tower case to set a drive on top
For setting the drive on top of a desk a longerUSB 3.0 Type A to Micro-B Cable 6 Feetlong has been good for my clients.To best take advantage of the My Passport Slim (or the WD My Passport Ultra) a USB 3.0 port is needed


Most modern laptops and desktops come with USB 3.0 built-in


Older computers can often be upgraded economically
I've used the ORICO PVU3-5O2I USB 3.0 7 Port PCI Express Card (5 Rear and Internal USB 3.0 20PIN Connector) on Windows 7 and Linux Desktops/Servers
If your laptop has an express card slot then a card like theHDE 2 Port USB 3.0may provide USB 3.0 speeds to take full advantage of a drive like the My Passport Slim.Having used Smartware on the Passport Ultra I find it a passable backup/sync tool

Calling a Dropbox client "automatic cloud backup" may be technically accurate, but I find it less than impressive.The drive is very fast as is theMy Passport Ultra
I did not run benchmarks on this drive

My time working with it was spent populating it with the files to be used in travel

With a USB 3.0 connection the drive felt much like theMy Passport Ultradrive when copying files to and from the drive


Generally about 3X as fast as a USB 2.1 connected drive


The Passport Slim was more than fast enough for its intended purpose.Here are the dimensions of the My Passport Slim  and theMy Passport Ultrafrom the WD site for comparison:Passport Slim: H:0.70in, D:4.33in, W:3.14in, Weight 0.48lbPassport Ultra: H:0.823in, D:4.35in, W:3.23in, Weight 0.50lbIs the Passport Slim worth a 30% higher price, even with a more "sexy" look? The Slim is a slightly thinner and lighter version of the My Passport Ultra and for me I'm not sure

It does seems worth the extra for my client who really likes the drive.If being ultra-portable or cool looking isn't important save about $35 (at the time I write this) and get the WD My Passport Ultra 2TB instead
If cool is worth the extra cost go for the Passport Slim


Both drives have virtually identical performance and features outside of the packaging differences.Because the Passport Slim does what it's supposed to with very nice "style" the WD Passport Slim gets 5 stars from me.Update: Mar 6, 2014The price differential on Amazon is down to about $30 now for the 2TB Slim over theMy Passport Ultra
Good looks and smaller size has become a more affordable.Update: June 29, 2014I have noticed the price for the 2TB My Passport Slim is now less than the 2TB My Passport Ultra! With this nice design I see no reason to stick with the Ultra.Hope this is helpful!

$REVIEW.: The Logitech HD Pro Webcam C920 is the top end webcam for the Logitech series and it definitely shows.I use the webcam mostly for business meetings with people overseas on Skype and the quality on both ends (they are using one as well) is excellent. The video quality is definitely HD.  I am a kind of subtle speaker, yet I have never had any complaints about audio clarity since using this webcam.It works great for doing YouTube videos or webcasts as the HD video and sound quality is more than impressive.I use the webcam mainly on two different PC's running Windows 7 and 8 respectively but can attest that face-time,  photo booth and Skype will work with this camera on Mac. The only thing is that the additional features like face tracking will not work on Mac. So if those features are the reasons that you want it and are working on a Mac then another webcam might be for you. Otherwise this is a great webcam with superior quality over most on the market right now.

The Air is very slim and the track are not deep enough, so it slides

It has a bad habit of telling at the last second to make a turn

This is especially true when traveling on some of the complicated interstates in Oakland, CA, and Washington, DC area.This unit takes too long to update if you miss a turn.The bluetooth function doesn't work
and you can't load an address book from a cell phone, or your outlook folder

The loading tool only wants to see XML files.Sony's support staff can't explain how to load an address book.

$review_text.: The batteries perform well but are constructed poorly. The first time I unplugged the batteries from the clips both positive terminal came off. This made the batteries unusable since they can not be charged.The reason for 3 stars (vs 1) is the amazon return policy. I got a full refund and bought the Tenergy premium 9V's instead.Buy with confidence due to Amazons policies, you might have better luck than I did.

The only downside is that I don't enjoy it with a TV program.  The commercials that normally get louder, get really loud with this equipment, but when watching a movie or any show without commercial's, it's an excellent purchase!

$review_text.: I've only owned this unit for about a week, so I'm bound to notice a few more things in the days/weeks/months to come, but I'm very tech savvy, so here are my observations so far:I bought this unit on eBay, BRAND NEW, in the box with all accessories sans remote, for only $[...] plus free shipping. Some sell this unit for well over $120, so I jumped on the deal after a bit of research. I wanted it for two reasons: a battery-powered digital TV for weather emergencies, and the USB port that would allow me to play media files.A number of people have complained about the resolution (480x234), but heck, I don't need 1080p in a portable device. The tiny speakers are adequate. The unit also comes with a nice set of earbud headphones. Also included is an AC power adapter, Car (cig lighter) power adapter (nice plus), TWO antennas (standard chrome 24" telescoping antenna and one of those short 3" corded portable HD antennas), and a composite audio/video cable so you can use the digital tuner with a TV set. The unit also has an IR (infrared) remote sensor on the front, but (at least mine) comes without a remote... which you really don't need with a handheld device. The unit also has a plastic "kickstand" in the back so you can watch it hands free.The antenna(s) plug (not screw) into the coax antenna-port on the side of the unit. Using the telescoping antenna (typically the least reliable) and standing on my patio, the unit scanned and found 46 digital channels - your mileage may vary (the signal was too weak to view on about 10%). Digital signals are VERY direction sensitive, so forget about watching live TV in a moving vehicle or walking about. I had planned to try the "worst" antenna first and rescan with successively better antennas to see how many channels I could pull in (DTV signals are in the UHF band, so loop antennas work best), but after getting 46 with just the simple rod antenna, I didn't bother trying the big ground antenna from my home TV. I probably could have pulled in an extra 5 channels. Not worth the extra effort.I was more interested in the USB port (there's also an SD/MMC card slot) for watching videos. The number of formats this unit recognizes is amazing. Not just MPG1/2, but AVI (including Xvid & DivX!), RealMedia and "VOB" (DVD) video formats (max rez 720x576). It also works as a video picture frame capable of showing JPG/BMP/TIF/GIF/PNG format pictures (up to 8000x8000), and even Text (TXT) files. Bizarre. The unit also plays MP3, WMA, WAV and OGG audio files.I downloaded a bunch of video podcasts on my PC and saved them (and a few AVI movies) to a 32GB USB flash drive, plugged it into the Tivax, and watched my own videos while waiting at the doctors office or doing laundry (smaller and lighter than a portable DVD player with no moving parts). Fully charged, the batteries (two flat card-type Lithium/Ion packs) last about two hours... enough to watch one movie. Use the home or car power cords to recharge the battery packs or watch TV/video once they're dead (the unit will warn you that the batteries are about to die and auto-shutdown after ten seconds.)I *believe* my unit was so cheap because it *had* one dead pixel smack dab in the center of the screen (almost unnoticeable), but after about an hour of use, it unstuck on its own, and now looks perfect.Only a few disappointments: As many have said, the controls are a bit cumbersome and not very intuitive. And you can only save five "favorite" channels. But the biggest annoyance are the battery doors, two sliding panels on the back. When you first receive the unit, the battery compartments are empty and the panels can be difficult to remove. But once you insert the batteries, the compartments are stuffed and panels doors slide open with the slightest touch. The batteries can easily pop out in your hands in mid-viewing. I ended up taping the doors shut on my unit out of frustration after having them open and the batteries popping out three times in one day.A "docking station" is available that has "better speakers" and lets you use ordinary batteries, but it's not terribly portable, kinda defeating the purpose.In the end, based upon my one week with the unit, if you find one on sale and you don't live in too remote of a location for pulling in DTV signals... or even if you do, use the unit to play videos, grab one. As long as your standards aren't ridiculous, you won't be disappointed.

$REVIEW.: This cable has a nice, thick wire, which means less tangling and less chance of signal interference. No ferrule, but it's a USB cord, so it shouldn't need it, although as I'm using it for charging only, that's not been an issue so far. The connectors are good, and I've so far not had the &#34;uSB' flip problems hooking it up, mainly because when I disconnect the cord, it's solid enough to stay where I put it (I'm using it as a charging station for a back-up battery).

$REVIEW.: Ok , the update process was painless as of Nov 2012 (atleast for me).After initial sat. search it locks on quick.Didnt notice lost signal in Las Vegas as previously mentioned.I disabled traffic updates out of gate. You can buy plain cord to remove/disable traffic FM update.Suction cup worked well. Battery was fine but only used this GPS for like a month or so.Well I used it around Las Vegas and I gotta say it just failed.  It took me routes that made no sense to go shopping like 5 minutes away.  There are a lot of new roads and construction in vegas but this had the roads marked on the map and would send me in clockwise circle to the left just to make a simple right hand turn at a light.  FAIL.It also kept telling us to take roads that weren't the highway.  Um if I want to go to North or South end of Vegas I am probably going to use the nearest Highway.  May have something to do with the fastest route setting , but since when is the highway system in Las Vegas not the fastest way to get around?  BTW I dont live in Las Vegas but 2 weeks there was long enough to get an idea of how to get around.3D was better than my old tom tom 2D view.I liked the Points of interest search you could do, kinda like having google search.My Tom tom seems to navigate me out of parking lots and when I wanted to go to Best Buy (dont ask- i know that store sucks), this Garmin put me in the parking lot across the street. It was kinda sad and disappointing.Touching screen to pan around was not good, the screen goes flying in a direction and u cant find your place again.Screen was bright and easy to read in Las Vegas sunshine.

$review_text.: This camera is fine for the basic person

first, It says it will display 640 X 480

That's true, if and only if you are viewing it from your own local network

Other wise if you are logged in somewhere other than your house it will be 320 X 240, which is one sorry resolution
Also, it sets up easy, but don't expect to EVER change anything after the first setup


Does't work with other Apps

I have 4 other cameras that i view with one app, but have to switch to ONLY Dlink app to view this camera

My advice is spend a little more and get a Foscam


You get pan and tilt and MUCH MUCH better resolution

I am sure there is others that work well too

I just have 4 foscams and have had no problems


They are a little harder to set up, but they also do a LOT more cool things..

$REVIEW.: Very Solid case. My wife loves it. It is listed as having a crocodile pattern, but this paticular color isn't textured like the others which is probably a good thing. I think a croc texture with the &#34;tribal&#34; patterns would be too much. It came exactly as described, with a stylus and screen protector. I like that the back of the case allows the camera to be exposed. The case rotates easily, and feels like a book when held. Fantastic product.

$review_text.: The only thing this screen protector does is protect the screen from scratches, etc. I ordered this one because of what it said it was. However, it is NOT anti-glare (it is shiny and has much glare -- especially in the sun). It is NOT anti-fingerprint (it smudges up worse than just having the glass screen!). It is also NOT anti-dust (dust clings to this like a magnet). It also does not fit the screen edge-to-edge. It is a slight bit shorter on the sides. Very disappointed in the money I wasted. If you want anti-glare & anti-fingerprint like I did, save your money and look for a better one!!!By the way, I ordered 2 different "anti-glare, anti-fingerprint" screen protectors that this company has listed, and they sent me 2 of this exact same one. So I am wondering why they have 2 different ones listed with a $3 difference in price if they are sending the exact same screen protector no matter which one you order. ? Hm.

$review_text.: We were unsure if we could easily install Windows 7 to replace Windows XP on our laptop computer

Some reviewers claimed problems, others did not
 Our Windows 7 CD was supposed to boot our computer in order to perform a clean installation

 It would not boot, however, for us


 We eventually found that a defective memory module we had installed prevented the boot from the Windows 7 CD

 After replacing the  defective memory module, the Windows 7 CD booted up perfectly


 We used the custom install method to delete all of the partitions on the hard drive


Then the installation went flawlessly


 We now have a few more years of life we can get out of our reliable laptop computer.

$review_text.: Update:  Still like the cover, but not thrilled with the stand.  Some games have a default landscape mode that is upside down when using the stand.  I also had issues with the stand staying upwrite on smooth surfaces.  Rating it at three stars now.  Protects the kindle very well, but sucks as a stand.Original:I've only had the cover for a day, but I like the design and protection of this cover.  The Kindle Fire snaps securely in place, the exterior seems well padded, and the interior is nice and soft, so I feel comfortable with the cover's ability to protect my Kindle Fire.  I like the design of the clips that hold the Fire in place, they were easy to use to insert the device and they hold the Fire securely in place while not interfering with the screen like straps can.  I have to admit I didn't understand how the stand worked until I went back to the Amazon website and viewed the video.  My cover was a gift and I didn't receive any instructions with it, but it wasn't a problem once I looked on the Amazon site.  The hand strap might be useful, but I can't find a comfortable angle to hold my hand while using it.

$REVIEW.: I'm very impressed with the SEAGATE FREE-AGENT GO-FLEX PORTABLE DRIVE. I have the 1TB (terabyte = 1024 gigabytes!) version and I thought I was dreaming when I saw the size. I've heard of a terabyte storage size but never knew it was available to the common consumer, until now.So, out of the box, the GO-FLEX is small and weighs just slightly more than my Droid phone and it's really quiet. It was easy to set up, just plug into USB port and follow the onscreen instructions to register and install the included program, which is on the drive itself. I did find the file transfer just a little confusing at first because I didn't want to just blindly backup everything, but I figured it out because there's an "advanced" option.I backed up 10.4 gigabytes of stuff (videos, pics, music, documents) and it took about 50-minutes using the included "Memeo Instant Backup" program, so it was a lot quicker than burning those same files onto RW DVDs. I think it took a while because the program was scanning the files or it might have been because it was mostly photos and videos, because on another computer, I tried the "drag and drop," going from Windows Explorer to the mounted GO-FLEX DRIVE icon, and copied 9.6 gigabytes in less than 20-minutes (but those were mostly music files) but you can't leave it working in the background like in the program.=====  GOOD  =====* MEMEO INSTANT BACKUP PROGRAM = this little program takes the guess work out of backing up your computer(s), so even novice users can save important files. launching the program will automatically scan your hard drive, pick out all files that can be backed up like documents, movies, music, photos, etc.--it won't copy program files, temp files, system files, so you won't end up with a lot of useless junk-- and then you hit "start" and it will copy those files/folders onto the GO-FLEX drive. it keeps those files in its own folder, taken from the user name on the computer being backed-up, so you can do multiple computers. option for more advanced users: you can select "advanced" and here you can choose exactly which files/folders to save.* PORTABLE & QUIET & LIGHTWEIGHT = for the storage size it's relatively light, compared to the portable hard drives of yesteryear. it's silent and runs power off of the included USB 2.0 cord. a "Firewire" upgrade cable is listed for pre-sale here on Amazon which moves data faster than USB 2.0.=====  BAD  =====* USB CORD = it's very short, but not a big deal.* MANUAL = only a fold out "quick start" guide. you must go to the Seagate web site for additional info.Anyway, I think the SEAGATE FREE-AGENT GO-FLEX portable drive is worth buying. It's easy to use, so both novice and expert computer users can back-up important info and never have to worry about computer failures or transferring files to a new computer.

The ball on the bottom is jerky when moving from place to place or when you tilt really far and try to stand back up straight. The idea for the monopod is that you are mobile and geting steady shots.

$REVIEW.: I read so much regarding JBL Charge being better than Dr
Dre's Pill, but honestly, after a few hours doing A/B, I chose Pill

Because of the Pill's limited low end bass range and its unstable weight distribution, I later returned it forDefinitive Technology Sound Cylinder, and returned that one for theBose SoundLink Mini, but Pill sure does sound much cleaner than JBL
People who suggest JBL also suggest you to get an equalizer app to make it sound nice, but Pill sounds nice out of the box
Between Pill and JBL Charge, I get the former every time
However, for my needs and our preferences, I came across DT Sound Cylinder and liked it very much


After a few days with DT, I tried Bose, and although DT had cleaner highs, my wife and I agreed that Bose is better all around speaker with its full range sound and incredible bass response.The good thing is Pill really looks awesome! The design is fantastic, and it catches anyone's eyes

If you need something to show off, and can afford the premium, this is the one for you

Unfortunately, I needed more versatile speaker, so even though Sound Cylinder is not as cool as Pill, I picked that one.What I did not like about the Pill was of course the limited bass and low end range


Other than this, I really enjoyed the exceptional highs on it


However, highs are not enough for every types of music, and Sound Cylinder had much better sound stage and dynamic range.For me, another problem with Pill was that it was too heavy for its size
When my friends tried to pick it up, many times they tend to drop it

Pill is heavier than people can anticipate, and accidents may happen


In addition, the Pill doesn't seat very well on the desk because of its shape and weight distribution, but boy it looks good.If Pill was any cheaper, maybe under $100, I would've never returned it


It is some piece you can show off, and the design is just incredible


However, the lack of bass and the weight was a deal breaker for me


Before you make your decision, go to store and A/B these speakers
Your ears will never lie to you.

$REVIEW.: I bought this computer for basic personal home use - Photoshop/Scrapbooking, minor gaming, internet, google earth, iTunes, and possibly small business use down the road -  I decided I had no desire for a touch screen, since I already own two iPads, and an iPhone, and I don't want to lift my arms up that high all the time.Windows 8 is tolerable.  I'm a Windows XP and W7 power-user for work - on my work laptop only though - and I don't think I would like W8 if I were needing it for work, but for home it's ok.  I had to do some Google searches to figure out how to do some VERY basic things - like close a program :OSet up was super easy!  I appreciate that this PC was already loaded with Adobe Reader, McAfee, and some free games - plus a bunch of other things I doubt I'll use.  I was able to install MS Office 2013, a "pre windows 8" version of Adobe Photoshop, a brand new Epson printer, and I moved my photos and music files over from my backup storage device without a single glitch. Unbelievable really!The keyboard is nice.  Very smooth - doesn't stick, and it's quiet.  I don't care for the mouse though.  It feels cheap  -  too lightweight  - bounces around instead of staying put on the desk - and it's wired, so the cord gets in the way - why did I think I was getting wireless keyboard and mouse??.  That's really my only complaint.  I will likely purchase a nicer, wireless mouse if it continues to bug me, or not since my kids will be using this, and they tend to break mice anyhow...The screen is beautiful.  Crystal clear, bright colors, gentle on the eyes, and huge!  I work on a 22" monitor regularly, but this seems more than just an inch bigger for some reason.  The unit does make an odd noise - quiet, but constant rumbling sound when it's on.  I liken it to the sound you hear when you put a sea shell to your ear.  My 8 yr old said it sounded like water boiling in a pot on the stove...

$review_text.: My wife wanted a small, good-quality digital camera, so I did some research and bought the silver Canon 300 HS. My wife tends to put aesthetics before technical features and she didn't like the look of the camera. I have to admit, the black plastic buttons did look quite cheap-and-nasty.Also, she wanted a panoramic mode like my more expensive Sony camera. Although the description does say that there's a panoramic mode, it just means that the camera will help you take consecutive pictures that can later be combined into a panoramic mode using some PC software. The camera itself doesn't create a panoramic picture (unlike my Sony).In the end we swapped the Canon for a similar-priced Sony camera (DSC-W570) which looked much nicer and had a panoramic mode. This camera seemed to be simpler to operate too, compared to the Canon.In summary, we didn't actually use the Canon camera so I can't comment on the quality of the pictures, but this review is just to highlight a couple of things that I didn't see in other Amazon reviews.

$review_text.: I considered buying this and a cable release for a Canon EOS T4i camera but I bought this first.  This device does seem to work behind the camera, but you have to be within a few feet of the camera. The setting to active the remote is easy to make on the camera and the control is VERY responsive.  This completely remoes the need for a cable release, IMO.  I could not be more pleased!

I've even captured using 4k and had no problems. For the people saying this doesn't work I'm guessing the problem isn't with the card but with either your GoPro or computer.Overall this card works perfectly and is much cheaper on Amazon. Don't bother buying in stores where they will charge you twice as much.

$review_text.: This little red wonder leaves consumer grade routers in the dust.  It's worth it just for the wi-fi range alone.  Places in the house where regular routers could not reach show a strong signal with this one, strong enough that I went from zero signal to a signal strong enough to stream HD movies through my Roku.There are literally hundreds of settings in RouterOS that allow you to tweak every conceivable aspect of the router's hardware, performance and security. The level of granularity is mind-boggling.  And that's where I must caution that this router is not for the beginner or faint of heart.You MUST have at least an intermediate level of understanding of networking principles and jargon, or you will likely be completely bewildered by this router. Out of the box, it comes with instructions on which ports to connect the wires to, the router's default IP address and logon, and that's it.  There are a lot of settings that need to be configured in RouterOS before you can even start using it as a home router (E.g. the gigabit ports have to be configured to actually act like a switch, as this feature is not enabled by default).Fortunately, the graphical interface for RouterOS is a life saver for first time users. It has a "Quick Set" feature that allows you to select the router's main function, such as a  "Home AP", and it will take care of configuring all the hardware settings in RouterOS to make it perform as such, and it also brings up a config screen for things like LAN IP, DHCP address pool, Wireless security, etc. that should be familiar to users of consumer grade routers. It's a nice way to get some basic functionality up and running with no hassles, and saved me hours of reading through manuals before I could even get online!Overall, this is a very powerful router that is probably way more than what the average home user would ever need; but if you are a network professional by day, a heavy power-user, or dedicated hobbyist looking for something above and beyond the consumer grade stuff carried by the Big Box retailers, then this is the router for you.
$SUMMARY.: Excellent Router.  Definitely NOT for the beginner!

$REVIEW.: Make sure you buy it with the knowledge that you won't be able to use it to the full extent a wide angle lens is used to. Otherwise you will be severely disappointed with this lens. But just how so?I know a photographer that uses this lens for wedding photography with her 10D. For her the lens does the job wonderfully. The lens takes sharp pictures, is light enough to haul around in a wedding, and wide enough on a 1.6 form factor camera to provide sufficient field of view for such event. The field of view on a 1.6 form factor camera would be equivalent to 45mm on full format; almost normal view.I on the other hand used my 28mm lens for nature photography, and let me tell you the results were not just disappointing but down right useless! Simply stated, you will not be able to use high contrast/saturation landscape and nature pictures that are procuded by this lens.  The bright sun will cause sever chromatic aberration in your pictures. Hence, the fringes of trees and light poles for example will display the dreaded discoloration (with this lens the color is generally purple). Every tree branch at the top corners will become purple at the fringes. Those are truly unacceptable results.Now for the big question, is it possible that I had a bad copy? Probably not. After being so disappointed I researched this lens extensively (especially on Fred Miranda site) and found that others had the same problem. In fact, its overall score on that site was 7.4 at the time of my research, thus my 3 star rating. After learning the facts I decided to return the lens instead of exchanging it with another one. Since then I have ordered a 17-40 L.Should you order it? This lens is a great value. In fact, I rank it as a best value lens after the 50mm 1.8 in the lower end range of Canon prime lenses. Nonetheless, don't expect to take stunning nature photos with it; otherwise chromatic aberration will stun you!PS. I agree with most of what a previous reviewer mentioned in his post, but wonder if he owns a good copy. This lens has been in production for a while and there may be a difference in quality between various batches out there.
$SUMMARY.: Before you buy this lens!

$REVIEW.: This is a solidly-built little radio that can function via the standard electric cord, crank rotations, or via three AAA batteries.  And, much to my surprise, it actually gets great FM reception.  This is important to me being so close to the Mexican border, and a high mountain range blocking line-of-sight reception from Tucson stations.  AM reception is also good.It comes with various plug-ins to fit various devices, so that cell phones of all types can be charged.The flashlight isn't very powerful, but it will do for quick spot checks in dark basements or closets.The small radio is a nice addition to have in any emergency kit. It's small enough to fit into a waterproof ziplock-type carrier.

$review_text.: They say that you get what you pay for, and in this case I think I payed too much. The sound is far from crisp and the lack of controls (base, treble, balance, etc) means that you can not adjust the sound to the material you are listening to. The source selector does not really indicate what output is playing (it flashes briefly in a series of LED patterns to indicate what source is in use, but is no help when glancing at the unit). Also, while I may be being picky, the IR receiver has a very narrow angle of view, and it sometimes take a number of presses to get the setting to change,

$REVIEW.: I have been using this monitor for about 2 months now, and I can say it's a great monitor. Coming from a retina MacBook, they pixel density was a little hard to get used to, but now it's just fine. A couple of issues: the power cord has a huge brick in the middle, and the brick-to-monitor part is a little too short. When I plugged the HDMI into my MacBook, the colors were very washed out and bad, but I switched over to VGA and it looks perfect, as good as an iMac's screen. I have not tested the DVI port. I also wish this monitor came with built-in speakers, but if it did, they probably wouldn't be any good anyway. Overall, this is an excellent monitor, I would recommend it to others.

$review_text.: I used to be a huge ASUS fan. But for the past 5 years, I have only been disappointed time and again.  I keep swearing that I'll never buy another ASUS products again, but then I'm lured in by a low price or a sale, and then I remember why it's never worth it.The Good:So this tablet has some good things about it.  The screen is absolutely fantastic.  I was very happy with it.  The design and build quality seem to be okay.  The form factor is not as good as Samsung's, but for the $100 price difference, I was willing to accept the massive bezels.  The backing was okay, but not as grippy as I was hoping. Despite what other reviewers say, note that the back is plastic, not rubber.  So despite its dimpled surface, it's still slippery and hard to hold with one hand (a common problem with oblong Android tablets). The sound was impressive for a tablet and the HDMI out is fantastic. I also like that it had a micro SD slot. That's so important and makes Apple look like a bunch of fools for charging $100 for an additional 16GB of storage.The Failure:Unfortunately all of the wonderful things about this tablet come crashing down to a complete failure due to a completely useless CPU.  I bought this tablet for one primary reason: To read PDFs.  My 7&#34; tablet is a little too small for reading rich media PDFs, so I wanted a 10&#34; screen.  I thought: &#34;How can I go wrong with a budget tablet with a 10&#34; screen, just for reading PDFs?&#34;  Well, with ASUS, they always seem to find a way to go wrong.  Adobe Reader struggles with this CPU to open a 4.7MB 32 page PDF that has lots of images.  At first I thought that perhaps this PDF was simply too much for any tablet.  But my 18 month old 7&#34; budget tablet handled it with no problems (other than the screen being too small).So I'll be seeking a new tablet with a different processor.  Clearly between ASUS and Intel, they can't make a tablet that can get even the basics of performance right.  FWIW:  If you own one of these and have this problem, there are a couple of alternative PDF readers that do perform within reason.  I'm personally going to return mine, as I feel no need to suffer the potential future consequences of this broken architecture.Bonus Junk:As with all ASUS products, this thing is loaded with bloatware.  Absolute crap software, and tons of it. I'm used to this after owning a number of ASUS laptops.  But at least with Windows you can permanently uninstall their bloatware (you know, over the course of two hours). But as with all bloatware on Android, you're stuck with this.  The best you can do is force-stop the apps and then disable them... sometimes.  There were a few I could not disable.  And even when you disable them, they still take up precious space in your 16GB of storage.  So plan to get that SD card.  Or root it once your warranty is up.I hate the thought of buying an Apple tablet.  But I might be forced to, given the currently disappointing lineup in the Android space.
$SUMMARY.: The CPU is tragic and ruins this tablet entirely.

$review_text.: I bought this TV and had a few problems with it. It would freeze and just do all sorts of odd things as soon as the warranty ran out. Sometimes it will turn itself back on just after turning it off. The freezing problem has  magically disappeared, and now it's doing well 2 years after the purchase (knocking on wood). At 1 year of ownership I was severely disappointed due to the strange problems, but now it's 2 years in and I'm not so bummed. Of course I want it to last forever, but I'm realistic in the fact that it won't. I'm just glad to have gotten more than 1 year's worth of service out of it, because many other unfortunate buyers haven't been so lucky.This TV has the best picture of any television I've ever owned, and the 240hz refresh rate minimizes the grainy picture in action shots. As for the rest of the features, like internet apps and all that, I never use them; I just wanted a TV with a good picture, and this one definitely delivers!UPDATE: A friend of mine asked if I'd updated the firmware in the TV, and since I'm out of the loop as far as electronics are concerned these days, I didn't know what that meant or why I'd need to do that. I let him install a wireless router in my home and the next two times time I turned on the TV it updated itself and now the problems seem to have diminished greatly.

$review_text.: I read a CNET review that stated that these were more stylish than the less expensive SKS-HT540, but that the SKS-HT540 had better sound."the Onkyo SKS-HT540 sounds a little better, but its speakers are a lot bigger and nowhere as attractive"I figured I'd like the more attractive speakers


I'd say in this case that looks aren't everything.While the bass is quite impressive, the mids were missing altogether and the highs were a bit flat, especially from the center channel.My Onkyo TX-SR604 receiver automatically calibrates the speaker setting via it's Audyssey 2EQ calibration system, which I've used with great success with other speaker systems, so I know it isn't receiver setup.I have to admit that I may be expecting too much from speakers in this price range.One final very minor gripe, the speaker wires included are pathetically thin


I certainly don't buy into the hype of bigger speaker wires equals better sound, but just from a material stand point the wires are pretty sad.I'm going to try function over form and give the less expensive SKS-HT540 a try.

$review_text.: We have had this TV for about 2 weeks now and are really enjoying it.After researching LCDs, it came down to this TV or the Sony Bravia 40"
 Most of the reviews gave  this TV the edge so, after going to see the picture and the TV, we decided on this one
 The picture quality is amazing
 When watching baseball or football the detail is like looking through a window

 The picture almost looks 3-D

 We haven't watched any movies yet
The sound is excellent, very clear.Until yesterday, I still wondered if the Sony might have been better

 On a whim, I went into Costco to check out the price on the Sharp
 They had the Sony Bravia 40" and this TV right next to each other


 Both pictures were good but the Sharp was crisper and the edges more defined
 Without a doubt this picture was better than the Sony.We also got the black frame (you can get it in silver or black) and it is quite sleek looking
 It is "piano" black so it has a nice high gloss finish and very subtle.Did I mention that it is as easy to set up as a Mac?  "Right out of the box."We love this TV.

Not as smooth/pleasant as my second choice, which was only two dollars more.

The Otterbox has a sleeker design but the rubber is thinner and is not as form fitting on the front panel by the on/off switch. The Survivor by comparison has more rubber all around and even added more rubber to the corners and sides for greater impact protection. That is the selling point for me.In addition to this, the rubber extends (about 1/8th) around the sides and front of the glass area to give the needed cushion to avoid glass breakage. So, Griffin accomplished what it set out to--develop an amazing case that actually protects your iPod if dropped.With that said, the designers failed an area that was a no brainer--the small opening for the audio cable does not fit their own car cable. I'm shocked no one caught that even higher up in the company before the final design was approved. Why sell a case that doesn't allow people to buy your own company's accessories? That goes against Marketing 101. You can't even hang all of the Griffin products together on one wall because they don't mix and match. Hello!I already owned the Griffin car cable but then had to buy their competitor's cable just to make it fit. That's bad business anyway you look at it. Unless, of course, Griffin designers are expecting their salaries to go up based on the increased sales of their competitors. Loopy. Whoever approved that design is missing their calling as a high level government bureaucrat.Anyway, the bottom line is this case will protect your iTouch better than any other case on the market. Just know the case's inherent design flaw in advance and make sure your audio cables fit that small enclosure or know how to adapt them.

$review_text.: Used it before and during a long flight monitoring my HP Pavilion dm4t-1000's run times
This included 5 reboots since airplane trips require that you completely shut down electronic devices, plus there is meal, and beverage service
Actual and continuous run time totalled 7-hours at full power before the computer started warning me that the battery had just 15% of remaining charge left

Almost 4 times the life of the original smaller battery


This is excellent performance for $32As expected it's heavy and thick, lifting the back of the laptop up a half inch

The lift and soft rubber feet on the bottom improves air circulation allowing the computer to run cooler
The fit was tight and removing the heavy battery is best done with the help of gravity instead of fighting it


Flip the computer over, use some force to slide the battery release, and allow the battery to fall into your lap.The only real problem is that its design blocks the screen tilt, limiting it to just past 90-deg, or about 100-deg, a loss of 30-deg

That loss of tilt was missed when using the tray table on the airplane, and the raised rear adds to the problem


So minus one star for this obvious design error.

$review_text.: Good sounding headphones.  Worth the 50 bucks.  But for 80 bucks the Sony opens up another dimension in the sound.  Good bass.  Full mid range but lacks complete clarity.  Fairly comfortable.  I would have preferred the folding ones.  Ended up getting the Sony which had folding and better sound.

$REVIEW.: I got this to replace the many of many Netgear and Dlink routers I have used in the past.  I got it because there were so many good reviews on it and I know why.  The wireless reception can reach the bottomless pit of my basement which my old recievers couldn't at all.  It has amazing customization options with it.  It also has a one button push if you need wireless right away.  I would suggest using at least WPA encryption though which is easy to setup via the disk that comes with it.  Overall I would give this 6/5 stars because it works perfect and has a great signal and great price.  Tons of awesome reviews can't be wrong, you won't be dissapointed with this router.  Don't even look elsewhere for any router alike because this one is in their price range and functions like a very expensive one.

$REVIEW.: I searched a while for a charger that would work for the iRobot base stations, many reviews were talking about issues not only with the charger going bad but then the charger destroying their roomba.  This one seemed to be of higher quality from the listing and the negative remarks appeared to be unfounded by ignorant customers.  I bought 2 of these to replace one lost and one broken charger.  They work Great!  First they have a blue status LED which was a positive so you can tell it is plugged in and working.  Second to the voltage and how clean the power is i trust it is perfect.  We have had 2 brown outs and 3 power outages this summer and our robot is still very happy and charges quickly and without issue.  If a transformer were to let though poor voltage or go out it would have gone out during the brown outs.  I do not even have it plugged in to a surge protector just straight in to the wall and it is working as it should regulating the power and providing clean DC current for our robot to charge with.

$REVIEW.: First let me start off by telling you all that I gave this DVD player 4 stars instead of 5 stars because it didn't come with an HDMI cord. The only reason that a person would but this DVD player is because they have an HDTV so why supply the old red,white, and yellow cord it's just stupid is what it is!The dvd player itself is light weigth. I would not put anything on top of it. It is easy to hook up as long as you have an HDMI cord handy. The loading process is faster then most upgrading dvd players.I wasn't sure about buying a BluRay just yet. I looked around and read a reviewer who reviewed this dvd player. He had bought this to go with his Samsung LNT40fx HDTV. I bought the same TV so I ordered this dvd player.I almost fell out of my bed when Romeo Must Die came on. The picture looked like an HD movie! This dvd player made that movie look one hundred times better. I'm not playing around here people.I paid $79.99 for mines and it was worth every penny. I have over two hundred dvd's and I did not want to part with them. They costed me too much money. Now I don't have to. I am very happy with this dvd player. Buy it you will not regret it!

$REVIEW.: I had two 16' M Series HDMI cables fail
They sell on Amazon for $195
Mine are 100% genuine
They told me to send them back and include a receipt
After 3 years I would have no idea how to locate a receipt


They eluded to the fact that they will either send a replacement OR credit me at the rate of the LOWEST they have ever sold for! Just great


At the same time I inquired about the banana plugs I have on my 5.1 system

They are Monster Cables
Each banana plug has Original Monster Cable soldered into each plug


There are 'rubber' boots, red and black that cover the back of the plug
They literally fall apart from poor material used in manufacture
In past years they have replaced them after I mailed in the crumbled pieces
Again I told them about this problem

They said "Send in the plug and the insulator" !  WHY would I cut off a professionally soldered plug ONLY so that they can send another? They said they only supply the insulator along with the new plug


So much for fairness and reasonable policies.UPDATE TO ABOVE REVIEW: NOVEMBER 20, 2012I stated above "We will see"

Well, I am impressed

Monster advised me that indeed the two cables that I returned did have intermittent problems

They said that they would immediately replace them OR I could have $400.00 in Monster Cable store credit!! How cool is that? So, I commend Monster Cable for adhering to their lifetime warranty

I chose $400.00 of items from their site and they did arrive postage paid at no charge to me

Lets hear it for the GOOD GUYS!

$REVIEW.: After 2 1/2 years, my Lenovo ThinkPad T61 was about to die from overheating. This laptop cooler lower the temperature effectively. I have confidence that it will extend the life of the T61 by another 1/2 year until when SandyBridge i5/i7 becomes mainstream.The construction of the laptop cooler is sturdy. It is quiet, at least after several weeks of use. It has a duplicated USB port so you don't lose a USB port. Like the other reviews, the height adjustment flaps are flimsy but I don't use them anyway.I strongly recommend this to those who have overheating problems. However, don't expect a laptop will last forever. The recent laptops are designed for 3 years of life. According to researches, 1/4 of laptops die within 3 years. Anything could go wrong, from processor, graphics, chipsets, memories, fans, optical drive, connectors.

$REVIEW.: During Christmas, I purchased a new TV, and being that it was flatscreen, I knew that the sound quality wouldn't be the greatest

 Normally, I don't buy RCA products, but since I was on a budget, it was the only TV I could afford.To compliment my TV, I got an LG surround sound from Amazon, and it came included with a stock sub
 While the sub sounded great, I didn't like the fact that I had to enter menus, a step that is nearly impossible for me, because I'm blind
 The fact that this sub has knobs for bass adjustment, as well as volume controls is very nice.Initially, this device was difficult to set up, not because there was anything wrong with the sub, but my sub which came with my LG system had a strange orangelooking adapter on one end where the sub plugged in
 Thinking I could just use the RCA connections, I tried this, but then realized my receiver didn't have outputs
 What should I do?  Then, I tried cutting the wire from the stock sub, it was saudered in place


 Then, I stripped it, leaving the weird orange-looking adapter in place so it would still plug into the system normally
 I then hooked up the sub, and the receiver cut off
 First, I thought I blew it, but realized that the short protection cut on


 I thought I needed a new receiver, but then I hooked it up yesterday, and the thing hasn't cut off since!  Maybe there was a loose wire?  Anyway, that's how you upgrade the LG systems.The sound quality is nice, though it rattles a bit on my dorm floor of my college; the neighbors hate me!  All in all, I love this sub, and it's a bargain because originally, it was 600 dollars, I think.

$review_text.: The hardware works fine, but the software has too few options for tailoring a transfer from a 1 terabyte hard drive to a 150 Gigabyte SSD. I had to manually move most of the non-essential stuff off the hard drive before I could do the transfer when all I really needed to do was clone the operating system and installed software. Then I had to move all the extra stuff back to use the hard drive as a data drive
$Helpful?.: [0, 0] $review_summary.: Requires a lot of time and effort to clone the operating system to a SSD.

$review_text.: Love this product - got it from a local store when on sale


The idea is transmitting signal at FM 88.8 while regular radio channel are at odd decimal (such as 88.7 or 88.9)
So no interference with radio
Range is much longer than 8m as it claims, works in 40m radius in fact
Using provided cable easily convert to a regular wired headphone.Design looks fragile


It makes absolutely no sense not to include the 4.5v DC charger


However give 5 star for its price.Follow-up after 3 months use: Sound quality is acceptable, but not orchestra type

Best for watch regular TV; it is very annoying when your batteries (base or headphone) are about to run out
Other channels would interfere, and often lost the original signals.

$REVIEW.: I am not a fan of silicone cases, how they feel, how they stick in your pocket, pick up dust, etc.This is a very thin, great fitting iPod Touch that will protect the back of the iPod Touch and potentially the sides if dropped.  It fits perfectly around the camera, buttons, etc.  Snapped on easily.Only thing I didn't like is the 'metal' in the title, since it is definitely plastic, and I'm assuming the 'metal' is the pattern on the plastic.

An issue I was never able to sort out with the D-Link router before it.This router performed great right out of the box.

$review_text.: If you need something cheap and fast, this is a good choice, but I do not feel it has the quality sound to be a permanent earpiece.It pairs extremely easily and within literally about 2 seconds. The charge lasts a decent amount of time, although I don't really think I got the full 7.5hrs out of it that it claims to have.The device itself seems fairly well built. It is lightweight, which is good obviously for something that is going to hang off of your ear, but I do find it uncomfortable and it does not come with different silicone earpieces to enable a good fit. The piece that sits in your ear is fairly large in comparison to some other bluetooth devices.The ear wrap piece is actually clear plastic, almost looks like lucite. I feel like it would snap and break if given the chance. Alot of times I would feel like it was not situated on my ear properly, and so when I would go to adjust it, or "stick" it in my ear better, I'd end up hanging up the call accidentally because the whole front of the device is basically a large push button which turns the device off/ends the call. You have to be very careful how you handle/touch it when in use.All of those issues I could have dealt with on a temporary basis but the sound quality is not very great at all, which is why I would not recommend this device.Almost every single call sounds muffled or slightly distorted somehow. I never had an actual crisp and clear call. It started to give me a headache during conversations lasting longer than 5 minutes. It is almost as if everyone was talking with a blanket over their mouth or something, or as if you needed to clean out your ear.I mean, if you are desperate for something cheap to use as a temporary replacement, or if you don't need a device for everyday use, this would be an ok choice if you don't mind the poor sound quality. If you want a device for everyday use, then I would look for a different device.

$review_text.: There are hundreds of reviews on this product. So I doubt I will add too much by writing about its features that you can get of the product description. I like to share my experience though using it.We had to buy the GPS. My favorite Magellan 200 was stolen from my van while parked in Philly airport. I miss it so much; when I said that my wife was envious!Having used a GPS for over over a year, I knew exactly what I wanted. A fast chipset like Sirfstart III, nice display - not necessarily the wide one AND Text-To-speech (TTS). The latter is the single most feature I wanted as I like to know which street I want to turn on rather than instructed 'Turn left in 200 ft' when there can be a few streets in a place such as downtown Manhattan. So my choice narrowed down to the Garmin Nuvi and the Magellan 3000/4000 series. The Garmin had a nice price tag for under two hundred dollars, so that clinched the deal. More over, Consumer Reports has consistently rated the Nuvi 350 a best buy since its introduction.What I like about the Nuvi compared to my Magellan is that it is very, very light. I can slip it into my shirt pocket and not feel it; not so with other GPS units. The display is clear and very, very readable. You have many choice of languages to get your directions in. But be aware, you need to select a voice with TTS (e.g., British English (TTS)) to get the street name spoken out. I wonder why the product manual doesn't state this feature. It had me wondering there was bug and was almost ready to return the product.The unit did not recognize one street correctly - kept showing Trooper Rd for Dekalb Pike; never had this problem with my Magellan. I found that it took more time than the Magellan in acquiring the Satellite signal when I powered it on, but not an hindrance so far.The box comes with a car charger AND a power adapter. Some units don't have a power adapter; this is useful as you don't have to be in the car to charge it. You can log onto the Garmin site and download a variety of car images and personalize the unit. I love that I can switch the vehicle to a Black Pearl, for example, though I don't know why I would use a ship navigating the streets.Given it is about a week since I got it, I can't write all about it. First impressions have been great so far!

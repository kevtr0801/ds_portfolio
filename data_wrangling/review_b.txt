$review_text.: Let me get to the point. Do not buy this router. It drops my connection on a daily basis and even minor changes to the wireless settings must be done after reverting to factory default. Whatever issues you might have is further compounded by the idiotic and RUDE Indian tech support, they speak perfect Brit English but their attitude sucks. What good is 24/7 techsupport if its populated by a bunch of oversea morons?The only upside to this router is the easy setup but after that the experience goes downhill.

$REVIEW.: UPDATE 11/10/13I have since learned of a feature of newer WD Scorpio HDs that many users (including me) may find bothersome
 These HDs use a very aggressive power-management scheme that spins down the motor after a mere 30 SECONDS of inactivity
 This can cause severe performance problems if you use one of these HDs as your main system drive


 This behavior is controlled by the actual firmware of the HD itself; changing Windows power-management schemes or BIOS settings will have no effect


 There is no real way to turn off this feature, as WD does not provide any tools to modify this behavior nor are there any firmware fixes available (not that I would advise messing around with firmware fixes, as you can totally brick the drive if something goes wrong)


 About the only workaround I have found is to use a program like Crystal Disk Info to temporarily modify the HD's APM settings, but this isn't really a fix because (1) the HD doesn't retain these settings and reverts back to the default APM value as soon as the drive is powered off (meaning you'll have to keep resetting the APM value every time you power up the drive) and (2) not all WD drives even allow their APM values to be changed


 The only other way to keep the HD spinning is to have something such as a virus-scanner or media player continuously accessing the drive to prevent the idle timer from kicking in and shutting off the drive motor

 For these reasons, I have to downgrade my previous rating from five stars to four

 This would still make a good backup drive or other uses where performance is not critical, but I would not recommend using one of these drives as a system drive.I bought this 1TB WD Scorpio Blue to build myself an external HD to use for backups
 I've been using Western Digital drives for years and with the exception of one lemon 80GB drive I had back in the early 2000s, I've had good luck with WD (I have one 2002-vintage 120GB WD drive I bought used off eBay and installed in a file server in 2006 that now has over 80,000 hours of 24/7 power-on time and it's still going strong) so WD was the brand of choice for my backups

 I also like the fact that WD drives aren't made in China, unlike others such as Seagate, which I stay away from for that reason (I won't trust my data to a Chinese-made drive)

 As performance wasn't critical in this particular application, the fact that WD's "Blue" line isn't marketed as a top performer didn't matter to me
 Even then, I found the drive to be plenty fast enough, saturating the USB 2.0 connection well before the drive maxes out

 With prolonged use, the drive does get warm, but not overly hot

 After copying several hundred GB of files from my other backup drive (I always keep two redundant backups), the USB enclosure I had installed the drive into was just over body temperature
 This drive runs very quietly; seeking noises are barely audible and with the exception of a slight "click" sound when the drive parks its heads (this is almost universal among most laptop drives due to their ramp-type head-parking mechanisms), the drive is basically noiseless
 As for long-term reliability, it's still too soon to say, as my drive only has a few hours' worth of use on it but the old 160GB WD Scorpio (which I salvaged from an old dead laptop and installed into a USB enclosure) I had been using before never failed me even with near-daily use and hopefully this 1TB model will serve me just as well.

Now it act as a light weight cheap NAS and DNLA server to the TV and ps3.As a router, it is rock solid
Haven't had any problem since I got it and is pretty fast


Not as fast as the TRENDnet N900 router (TEW-692GR) I returned as far as wireless LAN connection

But it is much much much more reliable.Would recommend to anyone.

$REVIEW.: I had replaced my other mouse (it was a Kensington model # 64321 -wireless and rechargeable) and even though it was a great looking mouse as well as expensive I absolutely despised that thing as it was too bulky , too heavy , came with a huge adapter (i mean we're talking about a MOUSE! what's up with that?) and it wasn't very accurate AT all.It cost me many many deaths (when playing PC games such as S.T.A.L.K.E.R).Anyway , I wanted something SMALL , COMPACT ,ACCURATE and FAST.The iMicro 3D delivers on all of those levels.It is pretty small (which i like , i don't like bulky mice) and it is light as well as accurate (most important thing) and it also has a pretty far range ( i think around 6 feet or so)Now I know many of you will say 'this is not a GAMING mouse' but i couldn't afford a true gaming mouse and since I've had a similar mouse for two years that finally died,i know i can use it as such.It has a very good accuracy and the range is very good.I know i can (already tried) play many FPS shooters with it as well as many other games , until I have money to upgrade to a 'true' gaming mouse.Anyway , I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good ,small and accurate mouse and who doesn't want to spend more than $9.00.If you went to Staples or Best Buy you'd spend at least around $30 on this mouse.To me Amazon.com has the best prices around for many a great things.
$SUMMARY.: Very responsive-good quality for even better price!

$REVIEW.: At first glance the FR 300 (sold under several names including Grundig and Eton) appears to be a modification of the very successful FR 200.  It seems to use the same case and it has similar looking controls including a hand crank generator.  However, with close inspection it really is quite a different radio. The FR 300 eliminates the 2 shortwave bands of the FR 200.  It their place it adds the VHF TV reception (audio only) and the weather band.  In addition it adds a number of gizmos.I love the older FR 200.  No one would say that the FR 200 was the height of radio engineering and it certainly has a few electronic warts.  With that said its pleasant sound, sensitive receiver and cool hand crank generator makes it a winner in my book (see my review in epinions).  When the FR 300 came out I was anxious to give it a try so it was off to Circuit City to pick one up.The Box:  The radio appears to be housed in a case very similar to the FR 200.  The box is approximately 5.5 inches square and around 2 inches thick.  Like the FR 200 it has a nice handle and it some with a nifty nylon case.  One side of the radio has a hand crank to charge the rechargeable battery pack.  This pack appears to be of the common cordless phone variety if you ever need to change it.  The other side of the radio has a volume control and a ganged course/fine tuning control, which operates the analog slide rule dial.  Instead of using the primary color theme of the FR 200, the ABS plastic is a classy silver and the speaker grill also has a more polished look.  Because the FR 300 has more gizmos than the FR 200 it has a few more controls on the face of the radio.  This may add a little more confusion to the technically challenged.  With that said, the controls and operation are very simple.  Instead of using the flush controls of the FR 200, The FR 300 has a number of raised controls.  These may be easier to grasp but they also add some additional thickness to the radio.  The addition of all of this spit and polish makes the radio look like a baby version of the popular Grundig S350 rather than a twin of the FR 200.Power Source:  Like the FR 200, the FR 300 can be powered up in a number of ways.  You can use 3 AA batteries, which should give you a very long playtime in this energy sipping radio.  In addition you can charge the separate battery pack by vigorously turning the dynamo (generator) handle.  90 seconds at two turns per second should give you over an hour of playtime at low volume.  You can also use an optional adaptor.  Circuit City did not have the Grundig adaptor when I bought the radio.  You can use a third party adaptor, but this must be done with caution.  If the adaptor is under 200 milliamps it will power the radio and trickle change the battery pack.  You can leave the adaptor permantetly connected.  If the adaptor is over 200 mg , leaving it connected can overcharge the battery pack and damage the radio.  You can remove or disconnect the battery pack and leave a larger adaptor plugged in, but this defeats the "emergency radio" concept.Gizmos:  The FR 300 is decked out in a variety of cool sounding gizmos.  Let's take a look at some them to see if they have merit.Flashlight:  Like the FR 200 you have an LED flashlight built in.  LEDs are great because they are very durable and use less power than a traditional flashlight bulb.  The FR 300 has a 2 LED system providing somewhat better illumination than the FR 200.  Think of it as a penlight.  It would be OK to change a fuse or even read a newspaper.  It won't light up a room.  All in all, a useful feature.Strobe:  There is also a bright, flashing red LED. It is very cool, but I was wondering what you would use it for.  A warning for a disabled car?  A cheap reflective banner would work better.  A beacon to attract airplanes if you are stranded on a deserted island?  Sorry no trips planed.  How about an emergency signal to attract the Good Humor Man?  Hmmm....  Anyways, I would rate the strobe as a gimmick.Siren:  The FR 300 has a very loud siren.  This seems to be a popular (cheap?) addition to a number of emergency radios.  This is another feature that leaves me scratching my head.  Let's say you were hiking and got lost.  A simple whistle around your neck would do the job nicely.  Let's say you were trapped under a building that collapsed. Well maybe, but you would have to have the radio at your side, which seems sort of unlikely.  The Siren would preclude giving this radio to most pre-adolescent boys, unless, of course, his parents gave your kid a drum set for Christmas.  Another gimmick.Cell Phone Charger:  The FR 300 comes with a number of adaptors that could allow you the ability to charge your cell phone by turning the radios dynamo.  Pretty cool.  You could also use a AC power adaptor (not supplied) to charge you phone through the radio.  Frankly, in the later case you should use the charging set up supplied with the phone.  The question is, can you charge your phone using the dynamo?  As mentioned above, The FR 300 is designed to sip at the energy bar.  My LG cell phone has two separate LCD displays, one in color.  It also has a keypad that lights up and (being a cell phone) a transmitter.  The FR 300 manual wisely omits crank times for cell phones, but you can assume that it would be a bicep building experience.  I can image that there may be very rare times when this feature could have some utility, but not often and probably a means of last resort.  Likely a gimmick.All radio testing was done with fresh AA batteries.Sound:  Like the FR 200 the FR 300 has a 2.5 inch speaker.  There isn't much base but the sound is pleasant and clear.  Plug in some headphones and you get wonderful sound out of both earpieces.  The sound is mono, however.  It is clear that the FR 300 amplifier section is of a higher quality then what you would find in a cheap pocket radio.AM (medium wave): Like the FR 200 the FR 300 has a very nice AM tuner.  You can hear some weak images of stronger stations on the dial but they aren't too objectionable.  Tuning accuracy is approximate, but it does the job.  Sensitivity is very good and I was able to hear a number of out-of-state stations with ease.  AGC was average.  Reception was similar to the FR 200. All in all a nice little AM radio.Weather Band:  The FR 300 picks up the 7 channel weather band which is used in the US and Canada.  I was able to pick up 3 channels on the radio, two very clearly.  My car radio was able to pick up 4 weather channels (as a comparison).  As a bonus, a nice, big knob controls the channels.  In addition you can use an alert function.  You leave the radio turned on and this function keeps it mutes the audio until the radio picks up a special signal for the weather service.  Sounds nice, but don't forget this radio does not come with an AC adaptor.  Leaving the radio on and then cranking it or changing the batteries doesn't make a lot of sense. Overall, I would rate the weather band as very good.VHF TV Reception:  Chicagoland has 5 VHF TV outlets (channels 2,5,7,9,11).  The FR 300 allows VHF TV reception via two separate bands.  One for channels 2-6 and the other for channels 7 and above. Using the FR 300 to pick up TV was a painful experience.  As I would turn down the TV band I would encounter image after image of blaring distorted FM stations.  On the lower VHF this garbage obliterated band channel 5.  This problem was also present on the upper VHF band, but less so.  Channel 9 was obliterated here.  Changing rooms or reducing the length of the antenna did not help this problem.  I also tried the radio at my office (further away from local FM broadcasters and more shielded from RF).  It was still horrible.  I exchanged the radio and the second one was slightly better, I now could get channel 9 but not channel 5.  There was still tons of garbage from FM on these bands.  TV performance was not acceptable.FM performance:  The FR 200 had a flawed but quite useable FM section (see my epinion on the FR 200).  I thought that the FR 300 would offer similar performance, but I was very wrong.  First off, the FM section occupies only one part of the tuning dial with the low VHF TV channels occupying the rest.  I was estimate that the FM portion is only about 1/3 of the dial making any tuning difficult.  When I first tried FM I was shocked at the incredibly poor reception.  Our two local FM broadcasters were imaged all over the dial, and I mean everywhere.  Even a flea-powered local college station was imaged up and down the dial.  Every once in a while I could tease another station out of the mess.  It was truly horrible.  Reducing the antenna length, etc did not help.  I took the radio to my office, which is much farther from our local broadcasters.  In addition, the building shields lot of RF. Here I still heard the local broadcaster smeared over the dial.  The flea-powered college station was absent but now the local junior college's station was popping up everywhere.  FM was unusable.  I saw one user report on the FR 300 noting good FM reception (Circuit City web page) so I thought I might have a defective radio.  I exchanged it hoping that radio #2 would redeem the Grundig name.  This radio had it own set of problems on FM.  The dial wasn't totally dominated by images from the local broadcasters, but they were present.  The local college station at 89.1 obliterated the FM spectrum below and all the way up to 92 MHz.  Similarly, the local oldies station at 95.9 smeared itself to WMFT at 98.7.  It also smeared downward, but it was such a mess I couldn't tell what was what.  It was clear that the way that this particular radio "fix" the multiple image problem was to turn down the sensitivity on FM, so even when I could get a Chicago station the reception was poor.  Even more bizarre was what happened when I tuned around 100 MHz.  There, I started to receive VHF aircraft traffic, I don't live near any commercial airport.I love radios, I collect them and play around with them.  The FR 300 has, by far, the worst FM reception of any radio that I have ever used, including cheapo pocket radios.  This appears to be partly due to poor quality control (two radios with two different problems) but I also suspect design flaws.As a radio collector I'm about to do something that I never do, I'm going to return this radio for a refund.  All the bells and whistles and gizmos are useless if you can't use a major portion of a radio (the FM band).  As more people review this radio I will be curious with the results.  If lots of people like the FM portion of the radio it is likely that this is a QC issue that will eventually get resolved (and I just happened to get two bad radios).  I addition, I have to wonder about the logic of including functions, like the weather alert option, but not including an AC adaptor as standard equipment.  With the myriad of portable radios available, including the nice FR 200, I can't image why anyone would buy this radio.  Definitely, not recommended.

 Many have said that an HDMI cable is the same regardless of whom you buy it from

 With the receipt of this cable I am satisfied that that this cable is considerably better than my other one
 I watched the picture of the previous cable on a 22" Samsung hooked to my DVD Recorder

 Please understand that I do not have the fancy electronic devices that would permit an actual scientific comparison

 I then disconnected the old cable and replace it with the new cable
 There was a significant difference in picture and sound quality
 To me it is worth the minor difference in cost.

$review_text.: I was looking for a replacement for my original Apple iPhone 3G ear buds and found these.  I listen to music, movies, and podcasts on the treadmill, bicycle, and around the house.  These ear buds are a great value for the money and built very well.  Sound quality is decent and crystal clear, but, understandably, you probably lose some of the low end you hear in the more expensive ear buds.  These ear buds do not have a microphone, so I can not take calls on my iPhone with these, but they do work just fine for music, movies, and podcasts.  These ear buds were just what I wanted.  I might even purchase a second pair in case these end up in the washing machine or lost or something.
$review_summary.: Good quality, great value...

$REVIEW.: This is the perfect smart phone accessory


I wanted something that I could charge my phone without having to be near an outlet
This product does just that
I purchased a powermat version of this same type of item and the plug falls right out

This one is not like that

I can have the phone connected and in my purse charging
This also charges my tablet, which is another benefit


It's slim and sleek and takes up little to no room in my purse


I never leave home without it
To charge this you can plug it in to any USB and charge it up again! I wish I would have bought this sooner!!

$REVIEW.: 1 word: Awesome! Many words: The receiver is fantastic. The audio and video come through great. I have my AppleTV connected to it, as well as a Blu-ray player and cable box and it couldn't be better. I listen to Internet radio through it as well, and while that could be easier to setup, having a web interface does make it better. I do wish they'd update the list of Internet radio feeds on the receiver because many of them are out of date.A few quirks: The manual says to press the Setup button on the remote control to begin setup. There is no such button so I had to press it on the face of the receiver. Also, the very light printing on a black background is hard to see. And the black backplate makes getting the speaker wires in there a bit difficult. But these are nitpicks.What's important is that the on-screen controls are great, the audio and video are great, and it's easy to use. Like I said at the beginning: Awesome!
$SUMMARY.: Awesome!

$review_text.: This CDRW functions typically for store-bought CD's

However, the player does go through the motion of playing home-grown computer-created MP3 CD's, but there's many occasions where there's no sound, no playlist, no shuffle, no fast forward etc., nor does file info appear in the display

You can hear the CD spinnning, but there's no output
So all those home-grown CDs with MP3s won't and don't actually play

$REVIEW.: This is either a great product or a bad idea.  I bought me a 22 inch Samsung TV and tried to hook this antenna to it. I received only 3 channels out of the 25 local HD Channels I get in the area.Of course I was not expecting much but to readjust the antenna all the time just to get the channel you want is not worth it.  I know i get over 25 channels since I also own a Terk FDTV1A combine with a Motorola Signal Booster BDA-S1 and it does miracles even in a room that is built of bricks and having big metal trucks outside of room (note: main reason why the little rca rabbit ears are bad idea for my environment.)If you take the RCA basic outdoors with your tv or if you live on a second story than i would say this is ok, but if you are like me, bind by brick construction and too much obstruction from big trucks and solid metal objects, this antenna is not for y ou...

$review_text.: This is an excellent item for your Canon SLR....I'm not sorryfor buying it.  Too bad Canon doesn't include an item like thisbesides the neck strap. I put the neck strap in my carrying caseand use this grip all the time.At first it took a little getting used to pressing the shutter button and using the finger controls with this grip on, but it is also adjustable and feels natural to hold an expensive SLR camera firmly in the right hand.  Simply turn the wheel on the bottom of the grip base and slide it out of the way when accessing the battery compartment on the bottom of the camera. (Canon EOS XSi)

$review_text.: I'm not the most tech minded person in the world and want something easy to use

 Well I couldn't ask for better than this


Plug in, crank the volume on your device and you are good to go.The drawback is, is that if you aren't tech minded and you have a very old computer like I do you may need to experiment to find the right out let for audio  input male jack


Once I found that I was good to go.I've tested these with a multitude of different styles of music from classical and symphonies to classic rock, to rap and C+W - I even tossed in a little bagpipe just for the heck of it

 Everything I chose sounded just as good as a huge stereo; you remember the kind I'm talking about...you know, the large stereo found in the dark-ages with speakers 2 feet tall and taller ;-)This gives the ones I could afford back then, a run for the money
 Excellent crisp sound a good balance of base and treble - NO not perfect, but great  value for the price and ease of use.If you really want to test these out, this particular song is a good one to put it through its paces.World OrderSample sent for testing and reviewing purposes.

$review_text.: As far as it goes, it's marginally OK. That is, it is functional most of the time. For some inexplicable reason the power switch is recessed, so it's hard to tell if the power switch is pushed in enough to turn the unit on (which takes a few seconds). I leave the unit plugged into a power source, and more often than not I have to disconnect and reconnect the power and wait a while before the power button will respond. The external wires on this thing are way too flimsy to last long, in my estimation. I wouldn't buy another of this model. It's not any more convenient than having a cable I have to plug in.I'll keep looking for a more reliable unit, hopefully one that will stay powered up when connected to external power source.

$REVIEW.: Grab one before they are discontinued.  Samsung drives were bought out by Seagate so this may not be around long. I use WD raptor 300 as my main drive and in random seek and brief bursts it is quicker but when transferring large files I don't see any difference.  You get a tremendous amount of storage for a righteous price.  My video card has HDMI output which I direct to my Yamaha Aventage 800 home theater receiver. I am now ripping my CD and music dvd collection to this drive so I can have all my music available for quick access. Given the giant real-estate I am storing them in loss less flac format which does not degrade the sound quality like mpeg 3's do.  The drive is quiet and in my research has a history of reliability. This will take a while to fill but I am waiting for the next sale and plan to get another.

$review_text.: Ok, it's a clever trick - you don't realize how much a/c noise or whatever is around until these cancels it, and it's quite astonishing when it goes away
 Woo-hoo, pass them around your friends.But..


 They don't actually /sound/ any good


 Loud bass, which pleases the crowds, but musically they're just downright bad


 Next to any half-way decent headphones they produce muffled, lifeless music


 Listen to the strumming of a guitar and it's just tones with none of the rich acoustic texture.And also, they don't cut out a lot of the distractions you might hope to lose, like conversations etc.
 They just reduce the fatigue of background noise

 If you spend a lot of time on airplanes, don't care much about music and don't care to travel light, perhaps they're a reasonable idea.If they sounded good they'd have 5 stars from me, but they don't, and they're very expensive.Background noise reduction 9/10, distraction reduction 4/10, musical quality 2/10...I'll be sticking with my Etymotic HF5 headphones and sending these back even though they were given to me for free by my employer
 One third the price, small and neat, and for better or worse they act like earplugs - they cut out the background noise *and* conversations leaving only the music, reproduced in a lyrical, textured, detailed way.

$review_text.: I am currently happily using this WiFi router, but my concerns about its security caused me leave my previous router between it and the Internet.PRELIMINARIES:0
Recognize that Amazon has mixed together reviews for a range of different models in this product family -- models that have very different performance, design, features, ..


So check that the review is for the model you are considering.1
Recognize that many of the earlier reviews here contain obsolete information -- problems that have been addressed by firmware upgrades


The 2013-March-19 upgrade added Guest Networking and fixed some other problems

The previous upgrade of 2012-Dec-25 fixed many bugs and performance problems
Having seen the earlier reviews and being a curious techie, I tried the original firmware found that that the _sample_ of reported problems that I could easily test were indeed fixed by the 2012-12-25 firmware.If you get this device, do NOT disregard these updates thinking that they are only optional (that is, only for those having identifiable problems).2
(update) Don't stop at the firmware upgrade of 2013-March-19--it has a major vulnerability that is being actively exploited (eg, Web search for CSRF and "router hijack")


There is a subsequent firmware upgrade (2013-06-17) whose description makes it seem innocuous and unnecessary for most users, that update seems to block the version of this exploit that I have access to.3
The pattern of firmware updates is worrisome

Some of the problems fixed are to be expected: performance problems/enhancements and compatibility problems with certain other network devices

For these, I applaud the manufacturer for putting out fixes on a 3-4 month time scale


HOWEVER some of the other problems are things they should have been correct in the initial release, and consequently I worry about undetected/unfixed problems that remain, especially those related to security since that is a critical function of this device (more below).In this review, _Security_ comes at the very end for compositional reasons, not because it is low priority.----My Background: I evaluate home WiFi Routers on three basic criteria: Security, Performance, and Features, and in that order

I place "Features" last because most home users, and me currently, will not need or use most of the more advanced features
I worked in computer/network security in the 1990s and early 2000s and computer networking starting in the 1980s


Being retired, I now have too small a set of devices to evaluate this router for more sophisticated or demanding settings.Because friends and neighbors ask for help in setting up/fixing their network problems, I am also exposed to the perspective and choices of the typical home user


This review contains elements of interest to different groups: experts, mass-market consumers,..
I have tried to structure the review to simplify your quickly ID'ing and skipping elements that are irrelevant to your interest/experience (not needed, too complicated, too trivial, ...).----Features: Summary: The features are as expected for this class of device.This is unsurprising because this is largely dictated by the chipsets used, and there is relatively modest variability across the competing chipsets at any given time


Because the landscape is ever changing -- what the newest chipsets provide and what device is using which generation of chipset -- my advice is that you use web search to try to find the chipsets used by the various models of router you are considering and if successful look at the reviews of those chipsets as a precursor for comparing the overall router.The software used in many brands of routers also comes from common software code bases (via different paths) but many manufacturers try to obscure this

And there are various combinations of components, versions-used and customizations-make

While the manual available for download is only minimally out-of-sync with the firmware, the documentation of some of the features is underspecified and can be resolved only through experimentation
But this is quite common for this class of device (not just this model or brand).The USB printer port worked for my printers -- a Canon MFP and 2 different models of Samsungs


This was only a brief test because the primary printer and the MFP also have Ethernet interfaces (preferred)
The utility program was easy to use and worked well.The USB storage sharing feature also worked, although I don't expect to be using it -- no current need and concerns about the security of the implementation.----WiFi Performance: GoodBackground: This is replacing a six year-old Buffalo Airstation WHR-G54S with its omnidirectional 2.2dBm antenna replaced by a Hawking Directional 15dB Corner Antenna (Model HAI15SC)


I live in an old house that was extended and remodeled several times by previous owners
There are enough perplexing weak/dead spots in my house that I cannot project performance to more conventionally constructed houses.I tested locations in and just outside my house using the (free) inSSIDer software tool with both routers within 3 feet of each other


In the 2.4 GHz band, the signal strength was equal or slightly better than that of the (enhanced) previous one
Of course, the difference between G and N protocols and 40MHz wide channels improved throughput considerably


For the 5 GHz band, I had no comparables.I got about 8 Mbps speeds when connecting from across the street -- about 140 ft with some intervening tree foliage


The router is in a front room, but not near a window and my computer was just inside the neighbor's front window.In the month of use, I have had no problems with the WiFi


No freezing

No unusual patterns of delays or larger latencies

My primary computer is in a separate room, through an open door but well out of line-of-sight, about 30 feet straight line distance.----WiFi antenna geometry and separation:This device has detachable antennas, allowing those that understand optimization of antenna geometry to do so.Additional spec: Antenna separation: 85 mm (left to center), 98 mm (center to right), 183 mm (left to right).FYI: For the 2.4Ghz band, the wavelength is roughly 120-125mm; for the 5.0Ghz band, it is roughly 51-58mm.Background: For a multiple antenna system (such as this), the geometry and separation of the antennas can have significant effect, but I don't know what scheme(s) this device uses and I am too out-of-date to judge whether this device has antennas that are positioned for performance or for manufacturing convenience

Example, one long-established multi-antenna scheme, "Diversity", benefits from having its two antennas separated by one wavelength.----Temperature: This device stays cool -- very close to ambient temperature

I have it in a fairly typical location: an out-of-the-way location on a table top that gets somewhat below-average air circulation
Explanation: Heat is a concern because it shortens the lifespan of electronics.----Auto-selection of WiFi channel and channel width: This is relevant primarily to a WiFi router that might have another such device placed close to it, such as in neighboring apartments or companies or departments in a suite of offices


Or not, depending on the nature of the walls in between


I live in a dense suburban setting, with my immediate neighbors' WiFi routers about 50 feet from mine, and we have yet to see any signs of interference (unsurprising based on the literature and my measurement of their signal strength as less than half of mine).Auto-selection was designed for situations where good-enough could be achieved without _careful_ coordination, or where such coordination was impractical (difficult neighbors, rapidly changing environment,...) In these situations, a common practice is to periodically check for _significant_ channel selection conflicts and make appropriate adjustments (manual selection, coordination, increase distance of router from conflicts,...)I experimented using my previous WiFi-G router to create conflicts, manually setting its channel to the three non-overlapping channels (1, 6, 11) to see how this device responded.The auto-selection of channels seems to occur only when the router is booted

This is expected because many WiFi adapters (clients) have difficulties or failures if the channel is changed while connected
Usually, it made a non-conflicting choice, but twice it auto-selected channel 6 when the WiFi-G router in the same room was already on that channel, but without any transmissions with its client beyond keep-alives

When the WiFi-G router was on channel 6, this router would predominantly choose channel 11 although I couldn't detect any reason for it to prefer 11 to channel 1.With auto-selection of channel width, I observed the width change a few times (using the inSSIDer tool) but I don't have the tools for a meaningful test.----Utility programs: Download the updated versions.The EasySetupAssistant utility was fatally and opaquely confused because I connected the new router to a second Ethernet interface on my computer
It seems to do little other than prompt for basic configuration, minus the critical step of changing the default administrative account and password
My recommendation is to start with Web browser interface.----Mounting:Although most people will have this device sitting horizontally, there are slots in the bottom to allow it to be mounted vertically (eg a wall), but there is no stand

The slots are designed to force nose-down or nose-up mounting because of the multi-antenna system

There is a very slight tilt to the indicator panel (on the front), but not enough to enable _easy_ reading when mounted vertically -- while I can see the _presence_ of the lights, I have to put my head close to the vertical surface, or use a mirror, to identify the icons.----User Interface and documentation:The Web browser interface has a panel on the right providing a significant amount of documentation of features being configured, and typically is close to what is in the manual
While this is good for the UI, it represents a deficiency for the manual


The documentation goes beyond simply providing a few words to disambiguate the labels in the setting panels, but routinely falls short of giving the user enough information to make informed decisions
Examples:1
On selecting what protocols to use, it says that if all your devices use "N", you can select "N only"
It fails to mention that selecting "N only" is likely to improve performance


Consequently, the user is likely to unnecessarily leave the default+recommended setting of supporting all protocols on that band.2

The router provides SW and HW NAT, but doesn't say why you might want to turn off HW NAT (Answer: There are some some devices/apps, particularly older ones, that don't conform to the assumptions built into HW NAT
If such are having problems connecting out to the Internet, try turning off HW NAT to see if that fixes the problem

Otherwise, leave it enabled).3

"IP & MAC Binding": The explanation in the UI fails to distinguish this from "Address Resolution" under "DHCP"
Most users will want the latter, but since it is buried one-step down whereas the former is in the LHS tabs, it is easy to pick the wrong one (a confusion that can be seen with web search)
Furthermore, this name is ambiguous, covering a range of capabilities


One use involves preventing ARP spoofing

Another simply improves efficiency.In most places, the UI does a very good job of providing error messages and warnings (eg need to reboot before settings take effect) and of indicating why a selection isn't available (need to enable X)


However, there is no warning that when you install new firmware, all your settings will be lost (so first you need to back them up, then restore after the upgrade).The quality of the writing in the documentation -- grammar, spelling and content -- was significantly better than I have come to expect for this type of product

The few passages that struck me as "bad" were in fact typical of what I encounter in many similar products (from China) -- awkward, but not unmanageable.----UI Annoyances:The layout assumes that the browser window will be very wide, with things such as excessive space between columns obscuring that you need to scroll to find additional columns with important settings.Significant amounts of the available status information is not under the "Status" tab, but under the tabs for the associated settings.MAC addresses have to be in the hyphen-separator format whereas most of my MAC addresses used colons, thereby inhibiting cut-and-paste
I did a cut-and-paste of those addresses into a TXT file, then a search-and-replace, and then a cut-and-paste into the UI.Some of the log files have Internet addresses in hex rather than dot notation (a0b0c12 for 10.11.12.18).Lack of inheritance

For example, for entering addresses on the LAN, rather than providing the subnet address and having you enter just the host component, the UI has you enter the full address and (correctly) gives you an error message when you make the inevitable typos.No uploading of tables: There are tables of data (address mappings, rules) that need to be entered manually that I would like to be able to upload from a TXT file

If you are trying to manage multiple routers, having such makes it much easier to keep all properly updated (no missing entries, no typos from manual entry).************SECURITY ISSUES1


There is no provision for signing off from the administrative interface despite it being a basic security practice to absolutely minimize such connections

There has been a long, long string of exploits that hijack such connections


Of most relevance to the current home user, there is a class of malware that you unknowingly download from an infected web site and if this malware finds an open connection to your router, it modifies the configuration to let the miscreants take over your network.ADVICE: Do not enable automatic supplying of account or password

The session is _not_ ended by a soft reboot (needed for many setting changes) nor by closing the tab in the browser (tested: Chrome, Firefox, IE10)


You need to do a full restart of the browser or, better yet, power cycle the router.2


Administrative account name and password need to be changed immediately


Both are well-known and are the first ones guessed
If the malware cited in (1) does not find an open connection, it tries to open one and the defaults make it trivial


Other malware that gets on your network will often try the same.2a

The EasySetupAssistant does not prompt you to change these.2b
To change this, you need to open the last tab "System Tools" and select "Password" (seventh entry).3

The USB storage feature comes with an administrative account with the same first-guessed username and password, and with read-write access (shudder)
As part of this, you can enable the router to be an FTP server, and make that FTP server accessible over the Internet


I RECOMMEND _AGAINST_ THIS -- see Appendix.4
Protection from Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks is turned off by default (under tab Security, under Advanced Security) and requires that you also turn on "System Tools" -> "Statistics" (there is a reminder in red of this)


I do not understand why this wasn't enabled by default: My router logs show a set of ICMP/TCP/UDP flood attacks every day or two (much reduced frequency from several years ago) and NMAP probes (the documentation is silent on this).5


The TFTP ALG (Application Layer Gateway) is enabled


TFTP is a badly obsolete protocol -- it lacks authentication and was designed for devices with miniscule amounts of memory and processing power

For at least 20 years, the widely accepted firewall rules haven't allowed TFTP except on the LAN


This makes me very nervous about all the invisible security decisions embedded in this product.6


I could not find documentation of what firewall capabilities this router provides, leaving me to make inferences from similar products and the details of how to loosen the firewall security


I don't like having to make inferences because they can too easily be wrong.7

The description of the 2013-March-19 firmware update includes "6
Fixed some vulnerabilities and improved security"

For a device that has a crucial security function in my network, I want to be _notified_ of fixes and not have to periodically check the manufacturer's website to see if there are new releases
I couldn't even find where to register my purchase to enable them to send such notifications
Unfortunately, this failing is common in this category of devices.And more questionable default settings (this review is intended to give you a sense of the product, not a tutorial).---- Appendix: Security issues of an Internet-accessible FTP server on a router ----The USB connectors on this router can be used for USB disks (Flash drive, HDD)

The router can be configured to allow access from the WAN (referred to as the "Internet")

Do _NOT_ enable this unless you fully understand your situation and the serious risks (for example, the WAN port is connected to a LAN you control and/or trust)
For virtually every use, collaborative storage in the Cloud (Google Drive, Microsoft's SkyDrive,...) is a better alternative.1


Do you trust the implementation of the server? Among FTP server implementations, there is a long history of exploits that allowed miscreants to:1a
break out of the FTP directories and modify system file and take over the whole system (your router).1b


override access controls -- add or modify files when they should have read-only access
If you must do this, at least use a USB Flash Drive that has a physical read-only switch.2
Do you trust your ability to select account names and passwords that will stand up to a concerted attack? If so, the empirical evidence is that you are fooling yourself


Realize that large sites protect against these attacks with additional software (Intrusion Detection Systems).3


Do you think that because you have a home network of 1-3 computers, the miscreants won't find you or bother with you? Wrong


They have automated "bots" (software robots) constantly looking for precisely this situation because of the higher chance of success.Why worry about someone out there on the Internet storing files on your FTP server without your knowledge/authorization? Think child porn


Law Enforcement Organizations (LEOs) in their ignorance and enthusiasm still routinely fail to consider other options for how such files might wind up on your computer


This is not "simply" a matter of time in jail and huge legal bills before the matter is sorted out, or of lingering damage to your reputation
During raids, the LEOs have a tradition of administering "rough justice", including things like allegedly throwing the handcuffed suspect head-first down stairs (the traditional "He tripped") -- this is a famous, widely-used motivational/cautionary story from WiFi hacking, but equally applicable to FTP servers.-- Douglas B

Yes, this is every bit as good if not better than the legendary Canon AE1 program which was among the greatest film cameras of all time.  The pictures that this takes lack any distortion and one can choose from a variety of high quality Canon accessories to fit all needs both photographic and economic.  The lens that is provided with the camera is most assuredly high quality and in case one is wondering there is absolutely no comparison between this and any of the cameras in the less expensive Canon powershot lineup excepting perhaps the G15 and or G16 which are great but do not have interchangeable lens capability. I purchased this product direct from AMAZON ( shipped and sold by) and that always makes me more comfortable because AMAZON simply does not handle merchandise unless it is a great value for its' customers.

$REVIEW.: As a relatively inexpensive set of headphones, the Sony MDR-XB600 is constructed out of non premium materials. The frame is plastic, the parts that are colored to look like metal are plastic, and all of the "leather" is synthetic. Each ear cup is finished in a disc of flat black plastic ringed with a painted 4mm silver outline.Most headphones use a single point of entry for the cable, but these have a cable going into both ear cups. The headphone cable is also a bit short for some, and is non removable too. The current trend on better headsets is to use the removable type of cord whenever possible.They do have a handy folding design that makes them easy to dump into a bag. The headband foam is quite light, but that is not a problem because there's so little weight to these plastic headphones.ProsFairly comfortable.Decent styling.Better clarity than some previous Sony models.Best used for today's electronic music, Rap, or Hip-Hop.ConsLacks bass control, and it booms much more than some may like.Pads could be a softer type plastic.Very poor definition of mid and high tonesSome software adjustment may be needed to enhance tremble.They received two stars because of their cheap build, and being uncomfortable, for me, after wearing them for more than an hour, and far too much bass with no way to adjust it.I'm older without the need for such booming, mind numbing, sound. I did make the mistake of acquiring this set of headphones without fully investigating their intended use, or all of the negative reviews. So for me they do qualify for a no star rating, but I do realize that for the younger crowd they might have some use.That is why I entered both pros and cons. But for me personally in general, they are useless.

$review_text.: Wow, what a piece of junk

 The speakers don't sound bad at all


 I like them

 The unit though, is absolute garbage


 The built in amp for the speakers blew after about 6-7 hours of use (not continuous use)  The blu ray player rarely can play a brand new movie without turning it on and off 2-4 times...how annoying


 Oh and also it will lock up during a movie and takes forever to try to get back to normal playback

 Sometimes over 10 minutes, ruins the movie experience
 Don't buy this item, look for a newer model

$review_text.: Aside from the fact that this devise is noiser than it competitors, there is another issue. The software associated with a lasar-burn CD-DVD devise is naturally going to be significantly large. That's not the issue. The issue is that the software associated with this devise, based on NERO, isn't just large, it's aggressively intrusive into the entire OS, and this has some curious side-effects when the OS is Microsoft.Of course, it might just be me. I'm always mucking around with codecs, among other things, so the Microsoft OS might be a little touchy even before I added NERO into the mix.Aside from that, this devise performs like a Wiz. I like it.

To begin with, it is a good size: not too small, but still very portable. I powered it up and it connected to my computer straight away, with no issues. I love the fact that it connects with Bluetooth, meaning I don't have to take up another valuable USB slot.I am very impressed by the durability. I have accidentally dropped this mouse several times, and it still functions just as well as the first day I use it. Overall, I would definitely recommend this mouse, especially for the price.

Came in the mail yesterday, NEITHER of them even have the IO panel in them!!! Just a worthless blue case with an empty usb hole!I gave 2 stars cuz the 1st was perfect, and was fast and worked well. But seriously poor product control. And they don't even offer replacement, only refund.Guess I'll hafta go back to the other cheap ones with those tiny annoying screws. Oh well....UPDATE: If you buy these I recommend doing so from Electronix Plus. The two that I got without pcb panels were from Amazon's warehouse so didn't have anything to do with the seller.

When I upgrade to newer models, I can sell the old ones as "looks like new ... had a Skinomi TechSkin on it since the first day."The screen protectors do create a different feel compared to the bare glass; I actually prefer the warmth and slight resistance to finger-sliding of the film.Although this skin is designed for the 4th generation iPan, I  installed it on our 3rd generation device.  Perfect fit, required a little trimming to make room for the old-style sync/charge connector.  Trouble free installation; the screen side went on easily, the back needed a little patience to get good adhesion at the corners.  (Hair dryer helps!)  I allowed the iPad to sit undisturbed overnight; next morning it was ready to use.  As expected, the few remaining air bubbles disappeared over a couple of days.

$REVIEW.: I Got this from Adorama via Amazon, along with what I considered to be a bare essentials kit for this beginner on a $1,500 budget:Canon EF 50mm f1.4 USM Medium Telephoto Lens for Canon SLR Cameras,Sandisk Ultra II CompactFlash Card 2GB, extra batteryCanon BP511A 1390mAh Lithium Ion Battery Pack for Select Digital Cameras and Camcorders, a couple of filters,Slik Professional Universal Deluxe Tripod with 3-Way Panhead and Panoramic Photo Guide,Lowepro Topload Zoom 2 - Holster bag ( for camera ) - TXP, TXP ripstop - black, navy blue,Domke J-803 Digital Satchel Camera Bag, Canvas, Black.... Great price, great delivery; I had not taken into consideration that the tripod would be as heavy and bulky as it is (not a con though), which added to the delivery price, but that's my fault.What made me take the plunge was a combination of the lower price once the 40D was out; research which led me to better appreciate the value of a good lens first, a good camera second; and the fact that the Canon Rebel line never felt right in my (6 feet tall) hands.First impressions? Swoon... It had been a long time since I had been wowed by anything electronic - computers lower one's expectations by that much, I guess. What I appreciate and will be obvious to any pro:- It feels like a well made quality product; great ergonomics, if a tad heavy;- It takes the picture "right now" with the manual modes, which is a major reason why you would buy this instead of a "point and (eventually) shoot";- You can unleash your creativity by fiddling with the dozens of parameters; I just read Ken Rockwell's excellent online tutorial and feel like I've been liberated: I'm getting the type of pictures I want after only a couple of days of playing with it.My main concern was getting blurry pictures because of my somewhat shaky hands; the combination of a fast lens and tinkering with shutter speeds and exposure has saved the day.Does the 40D do more things? Sure. Is it better? Not until you are able to master the endless combinations this amazing camera affords; only then does it begin to make sense, for a beginner at least.

Very clean and solid construction of the box and hasn't moved since I installed, though plan on a strap or brackets to ensure no movement under hard braking.Lights are nice and don't distract.No problems so far and have cranked to where the Harmon Kardons crackle and the bass is still solid.

$REVIEW.: I really agonized about buying this lens. 40+ year ago, I rented a Nikon circular fisheye lens for a PR shoot on behalf of my electrical connector client Amphenol, and the image made the business page of hundreds of newspapers around the world. But the fisheye look was so overdone since then that I never looked twice at any optic labeled "fisheye.Then on the DPREVIEW "Sony Talk" forum, I read about the "Hemi" software that turns this lens into a superwide, if you are careful about keeping it level when you shoot scenes - and the images were amazing.So I bought it. I was looking for something really wide for my NEX-6, which I shoot mostly with my Leica 35, 50 and 90mm M mount lenses. I own the Tokina 11-16 for my Nikon D7000, and I've been thrilled with it. At 11mm, however, objects near the edge of the frame - especially people - it distorts in ways you don't appreciate normally. For example, my 5 foot tall partner looks like she could dunk on LeBron James. And the Tokina + D7000 is very, very heavy - at least 3 pounds.The Rokinon on the Sony NEX-6 blew me away. It is way sharper than I expected. And it is very light - the combination of lens (8 ounces) and NEX-6 body (about 12 ounces) is featherweight by comparison.Without the correcting software, vertical objects on the edges of the frame, buildings etc. are distorted. But the predictability of that curvature has enabled several software companies to write Photoshop and Aperture plug-ins that basically convert the Rokinon into a true superwide lens. That software, plus that built into Photoshop, enable one to shoot really fine 180 degree images.The uncanny fact of the 8mm is that most people can't process the concept of a 180 degree lens. You can shoot at a 90 degree angle from them from a distance of 4 feet and they have no idea they are in the frame.My Tokina 11-16 persuaded me that I am one of perhaps a few people who see the world in wide angle. You know that feeling when you walk into a cathedral and are just stunned by the grandeur? Or when you look out on the Grand Canyon or the Empire State building, and are taken aback by the view?The Rokinon will let you capture that sensation. And it will be sharp, flare-free and contrasty.Like any wide angle lens, the Rokinon can be over-used. But it's small and light enough to pack with your NEX with other primes and zooms - and I promise you that when you look at your shots, you'll be as thrilled as I am. If you own the 16-50mm kit lens, this or the $900 Sony 10-18mm lens are your choices.Buy the Rokinon for a third of that price, and get a sharper, more interesting lens.
$SUMMARY.: Yes, it's a "fisheye" - but with the right software, it becomes a superwide

$REVIEW.: Got this about a week ago and the micro SD card slot will not work with any SD cards. The same cards work fine on my Linux and Windows boxes. It may be a fluke but my SD card slot feels a bit dodgy. My recommendation is they go with a straight in friction based card slot. Instead they used a spring loaded slot that at best barely holds the card. I found that when I wiggled the card in the slot the system would cycle thru messages of "sd card corrupted", sd card needs formatting", or "sd card removed" (even if the card was still in the slot). Formatting the card (when the msg came up) had no discernable effect. Anyway it is going back today and I will order a new one. If the new slot works and feels solid I will come back and upgrade this.Now for everything else. I am playing with Raspberry Pi as well as the mini PC. Let me say that the Raspberry Pi is a serious toy for hobbyists looking to program and design. The mini pc is more for those the next level up. The cpu and RAM are better than the RasPi but the access to design and programming features is less, not to say you can't code on a mini PC, but you'll need to get a terminal window up on it 1st. (That's the end of comparing the 2) The Mini PC came up and detected the wireless keyboard and mouse just fine. The built in wireless nic picked up our network and after adding the mac and security to my router it connected fine. Pretty quick I had web browsing and Kindle on our TV which was one of my goals. Video played well, not as smooth as thru our smart Blu-Ray player, however I am disappointed that Amazon Prime acct has not been ported to the Linux based Mini PC. Our Google accts are fine (as expected). In fact all the stuff on our Droid phones loads up and runs fine. (Don't forget to get antivirus and FW, free or paid).So back to the mini SD card. Without it there's no beefing up your memory, storage space, or booting into an alternative linux system like Ubuntu. If Ubuntu runs with a 64GB SD card as well as a 1TB usb drive, I'll have access to our video and music libraries. If that all goes smooth I'll bump this up to a 4 or 5. Note: The total cost with a wireless keyboard and mouse, and a powered USB hub, the total cost is about $100 for a Linux based PC using your TV as a monitor. (Minimal to moderate Geek Skills required.) Update:Got a replacement with working memory card slot. Cannot get alternate Linux OS's to load using published hacks. It has been fun getting internet to run on the flat screen but consider this device a hobby gadget, not a replacement for the Smart TV options of a Blue Ray DVD or HDTV.

$REVIEW.: Not sure how this product got an average positive rating. Out of many anaglyph glasses I used ( I do 3D rendering software) these glasses give me the most uncomfort. The reason is that the red half is much darker than cyan.As soon as you put the glasses on you feel something is wrong.After some short times of using then  my head starts spinning and I feel nausea. I would blame my own body for this but it does not happen with other glasses.EDIT:Just compared side by side with other glasses I have. and had to remove one start ( from two) The cyan half on these ones are definitely more blue than cyan. Combined with the fact that the saturation of the halves is inconsistent the glasses go to the trashcan.

$review_text.: Other have detailed reviews. Features, etc. I have been shooting with a D7000 and S100 for quite awhile. I have tried many pocket-carmeras. Returned several, gifted others. This one I shall keep. Images stunning. Handling excellent. Options. Too many but enjoyable to discover. Sit with the camera. Play with it. Discover what it does. My only neg is the zoom. But as all have said the images, so, so very good. For me it has been a matter of getting past the fact that I can edit my photos instantly on my ubiquitous iPhone5 and have become super lazy with regard to shooting with my DSLR or for that matter my S100. Sorry I am a "real" photographer (made a living for years) but do love uploading to instagram and FB. So it goes. Now I am taking the extra steps, camera to computer to phone to wherever. I print from time to time. Photobooks as well... and now with the RX100 I am back shooting with a camera once again... very cool. Worth the money... The last star missing is the zoom/macro... could be longer and closer...

$REVIEW.: I have had a few of the dlink cameras for a year or two now and was always kind of disappointed that I could only record still images. Didn't realize that they made this thing. I was using a dedicated pc for recording still images previously and this is much more convenient. It sets up on your network just like the cameras and you just have it search for the cameras that you want it to record. You can view the live cameras and the historical footage from their app(not the myDlink Lite, there is a separate one for this. NVR CamViewer i think).There is a really annoying buzzer that goes off anytime it loses connectivity to the network or one of the cameras. The buzzer is unreasonably loud and does not seem to turn off without resetting the device. This is especially annoying if it happens in the middle of the night. The buzzer can be easily disabled from the web interface for the recorder.About the wired only connection. I assumed that they did this to save on cost, so I set it up with a wifi bridge for some more flexibility on placement. This did not work out well. Performance was pretty terrible, I was only getting about 5-10FPS recorded on my cameras vs a full 30FPS on a wired connection. Not surprising though since this will monitor 8 cameras and will record up to 4 streams at a time plus it will output those streams to your phone/tablet/computer for viewing at the same time. I can see where the wifi might not be able to keep up unless you have these things on their own dedicated network.In SummaryThe GoodSmallPower efficientInexpensiveEasy to setupThe BadSwitching between the different camera feeds can be sluggishReviewing historical footage can be sluggishThe loud buzzer that is on by defaultOverall I am very happy with it.

$REVIEW.: I have just ordered this from Amazon for the lowest price I have found anywhere @$445.00, and am excited about getting it. I have seen some complaints,,, that has been a worry. I am counting on Onkyo to be a stand up company by putting out a to Quality product,,,,, especially at this premium price. The 809 has every thing on my bucket list.....including value at this price. I am a old guy and fear I will be really worked to get the full potential out of this unit. I am really interested to see just how it will improve my TV reception,,, I have a Visio 50" 3 year old unit bought from COSTCO. I really want a 3D,,, but only after they are really perfected,,,, and they are getting there now. Prices are dropping,,,, I will pull the trigger very soon I think. Getting this is preparatory to that purchase,,,, especially since this 809 was priced at such a good price. I buy lots off of Amazon,,, and have never had a problem at all. There may be too much technology for me here,,,,,, but I think I will have fun setting it up. Any suggestions out there for setting up the TV and speakers? I also have a LG CD player that is a couple of years old that I got from Amazon. I have ordered banana connectors, and the thing that will let me stream it off my router without cables. Does anybody know if I will be able to udate the 809 off the internet just using this item? If the build date of the unit is a later one I may not need updating cuz the main one were last available in July. Just waiting to see how it all works out. I have a lower end speaker system with a powered subwoofer (5.1,,,SLS) that are 4ohm so it will be interesting to see how that works. Any suggestions about my system will greatly appreciated.Update 1/9/12.... Just got my 809 mostly set up... Worked with a Onkyo tech for about 20 min who really helped me out. There is a bit of a problem with the remote as I can't get the remote to turn the tv off, but it does turn off the 809. Seems everything else is working on  remote regarding I  the 809. My unit came with all the udates already installed (Last was July 2012). I also installed the UWF-1 Wireless LAN Adapter.... though had to do it off the 809 and not the remote,,, I tried several times to use the remote but it just wouldn't do it. I get 73% off the modem,, a $29.00 from Walmart CISCO modem. I am trying to get the remote set up to do all the things needed,,, but I am not sure how to do it. Speakers set up really easy,,, default is already set at 12feet, and I only have 2 front 4 Ohm speakers, a center speaker and a Bass. It all turned up the first time I actually turned the set on. Its been painless so far, but still lots to learn. I used Banana plugs for the first time and they worked great. My tv is a Vizio about 5 years old and it sure has improved the picture. I will still be tweeking the whole system, so if anybody has any thoughts or hints on how to really set it up for the long haul I will appreciate any suggestions at all. I haven't tried the LG CD yet but will soon.Update 1/17/12... Well guys,,, this system works great so far. Still learning how to go between different functions but everything has worked great. My LG CD player works flawlessly with the 809 and the main thing I use it for is Netflex and great!!! Pandora music is outstanding and soooo easy to use. This is a really big heavy unit.. That is a good thing. All the weight is heat sinks and other necessary things to keep everything working without a lot of heat. I have checked it after using all day and its a 97 degree's. Of course I am using a 4 Ohm 5.1 speaker system so its most likely just idling along. I really don't crank it up a lot.... only to about 65 on the volume indicator. I don't know what the difference would be if I were using 7.1 and really cranking it up... I guess it would be using lots more Watts. My speakers are good for only 100 Watts I think, so I gotta keep it in check. I did buy the extended warranted for safety's sake giving it a 4 year protection. There is so much more on the 809 than I will ever use. The difference it has made on my 5 year old Vizio is fantastic.. I am looking a new 3D 60 inch at COSTCO and and am wondering just what the 809 will do for that. So far a great investment..... I recommend it highly.Update 3/18/2013:  I finally got two Polk 75T speakers (They are big @ 4 feet tall with 4 speakers inside and a great tweeter) and replaced two small really good book shelf speakers.. wow what a difference. I worked with a Onkyo tech and he sure helped me out. I gotta admit I am astonished at the result. I had thought the first the original setup was great and it was,,, but the new large front speaker set up is outstanding...... I a so thankful that I bought this unit.....Update: 3/23/2013.... I worked with a Onkyo tech to set up my speakers and boy did it improve all of them.... He had me set everything to THX and surround.... what a difference. Lots of other tweaks also,,, but don't actually remember how to do them cuz I just followed what he said. Going to Pandro on the net button is flawless and works sooooo sweet. As you can tell I am still learning lots about the receiver,,, and still lots to go. I am mixing Surround 4 Ohm speakers with my Front 8 Ohm Polk 75T's,,,, but the volume is outstanding. I am not sure what the sound would be if I were using all 8 Ohm speakers. Having a Sub Woofer really helps, though its a rather cheap 8" one...... Really fills the room. I am really thinking of getting a 3D TV and wondering just how great this will work cuz the 5 year old 47 inch Vizio I now have is a 720, but this 809 really cleaned it up,,,, I can't imagine what a 1080 would look like. Any comments out there????????? Gotta say,,, I am really glad I bought the 809..Update: 8/30/13..... I donno,,, my unit stoped putting out HDMI video. I am going to try a few things,,,, but I am worried. I still get sound,,, but no picture at all. It doesn't show any problems on the face plate.... I will report on what I find... Its been a outstanding unit up till now.Update: 9/7/13...... Worked with Dan at Onkyo product support and he really helped me. We disabled the "Deep Color" part of the HDMI section and the system was restored. I don't know how the interaction is done,,, but it sure fixed the problem... I am also getting 1080 on my set (Vizio 47 inch) rather than the previous 780 and I don't know how that happened at all. The unit is again working flawlessly and I am a happy camper....Update: 9/14... Unit is working better than it ever has,,,, the fix seems to be the deep color problem, I wonder if this hasn't been the problem all along with the HDMI. Again my Vizio is still showing 1080 instead of the 720 previously. If my unit doesn't break down and keeps giving such steller performance I will be a very happy camper..... Been great so far.Update: 11/9/2013  Just comared the 809 with the latest model equal to the 809.... the 809 is hefty at around 40lbs,,, the new unit is around 33lbs... I gotta wonder if the newer unit is as sturdy as the 809,,,, Ya, 40lbs is heavy,, but its also indictive quality and ability to disperse heat... Comments are appreciated.....
$review_summary.: Just bought, have had it 5 months now..... great unit,

$REVIEW.: I purchased the drive brand new and used it as the replacement OS drive for my Dell Inspiron 1545 laptop. The drive performed well for 3 months and then unexpectedly died. There were no signals of pending failure or suspicious behavior prior to failure. So when it died I couldn't recover anything and basically all new documents since last backup were lost. As if this wasn't enough, I contacted the manufacturer of the SSD to get an RMA since the drive was under the warranty and the manufacturer proceeded with a torturous questionnaire for me to fill up. They wanted to know technical things such as if SATA settings that are in BIOS are set to AHCI or to IDE or what Bios version I'm using, etc. Ok, I'm quite technically inclined and I can figure things out but what if this was addressed to someone with no technical know how. After all, such 'replacement' hard drives as the one I bought are marketed as easy to replace as your cat's litter box. I don't know why they do that but it makes it hard for the common person to send back the faulty item. Anyway, I completed the questionnaire and emailed it back. Then I got a prepaid UPS label + RMA and instructions as to how to email the faulty hard drive back to the service center. A month passed by and I'm still waiting. So I emailed the service representative back asking about where is my hard-drive and I'm still waiting.I had incidents in the past where electronic devices failed under the warranty period but I never had to wait for such a long time to have them serviced. For this reason, I give the SSD a one star not because it's of a lesser quality than other major brands but because the people who stand behind it seem to do a lousy job.

I have found the sound to be a little shallow but this is a small system so I don't feel at all cheated

The sub is nice and the wireless works great with no interference to any other wireless system in the house.I would prefer a deeper mid and lower range but then I would be paying $400-$600 per speaker and still need a pre-amp and amp which would be a couple thousand easily so again, for the price this is a great system.

$review_text.: Overall great camera with unbelievable long range zoom and indoor image quality even in low light, in a form factor which was much smaller than I expected


Extra features are really nice including 3D photos (which looked good on my Panasonic plasma 3D TV) and panorama photos, as well as continuous shooting mode which takes so many photos in rapid succession that they look like a video


One fun feature is pet detection mode which automatically snaps a picture whenever it senses a cat or dog face


(Didn't test multi-record mode yet.)  Menus are fairly easy to navigate.Although I am very satisfied, there were a few areas which leave room for improvement

Shutter lag as well as processing time after each picture was a bit longer than I expected, with the camera freezing for a second or two when "busy" preparing for the next shot (using a class 6 SDHC card)
Photo quality was generally very good, but was a bit blurry when capturing moving objects or some extreme telephoto shots if not holding the camera still
Video was good but the microphone picked up some wind sounds in a light breeze.FYI, the Sony LCS-CSJ case is a perfect fit for this camera (it's hard to find compact cases for this one.)

$review_text.: I will probably be stuck with 2 Corsair RAM after these two bad RAM are replaced and returned to me, but if I had a choice I would not get them again, even though they do look cool.I wouldn't mind if one, or even both RAMs were DOA, but the situation is worse. The RAM comes with two metal panels on each side for grip (and possibly cooling). Not only was one RAM bad (memtest spotted that one) but the other RAM broke when pulled out of the motherboard. One of the two metal panels just snapped off. It was shocking given how these are supposed to be above average RAM.I could get some heat sink thermal compound and put it back on but I decided not too because the other bad RAM must go back anyway.Corsair gets good reviews but this is far from solid, stable RAM. Poor quality control coupled with hardware that part in your hand didn't bold well for me. I ended up going down to the local computer store and buying a set of average common looking 2GB 800 mhz RAM, for less, which worked. Before Corsair can sell their image as a leading brand name they need to up quality control and provide working hardware first, then much better robustness and after that we can talk cool looks.When I do get the RAM back my system will be 4 GB of memory in total but this RAM experience set me back. I can't comment on performance, as I would have liked to, but to be honest it isn't all about the performance and as you can see not even getting things off the ground result in bad reviews. I will keep you updated on what happens next.*Update 16th July 2008*I went through 5 sticks in total to get 2 working ones. That is a 60% failure rate. I would just spend on regular RAM in the future and forget about splashing out for fancy RAM.

$review_text.: I love all the colors, and I really like how it's super cheap. So far I have bought the iBenzer case in orange, blue, light blue, and black for me and a few friends. The colors are a little girly, so I would stick to black for a guy, or a similar neutral color. Very good price for both the cover and the keyboard. The keyboard cover has definitely protected my computer because I always eat in front of my laptop and my last one stopped working because crumbs got in. This blocks the crumbs and makes it easy to clean.However, one of my cases did crack and start breaking after about 8 months, so not sure how durable they are. They're so inexpensive, though, I just bought a new one!

$review_text.: I have used my laptop for a few days now and put it through some different trials.  I tried videos, no problems, the only thing I wish could of been a little better was the sound of the speakers, but that's just the style of the laptop, it's hard to concentrate on both light and slim and at the same time have insanely large speakers.  Next I inserted a few CD's including a movie which played perfectly and very clear, again the speakers are loud enough, just a little high pitched.  You can always plug in a set of aux speakers if you wish.  I installed a couple simple action games to make sure they would load and play and again no problem.  I miss the old Sony power switch on the end of hinge, now it's like most other laptops positioned directly above the number keys.  One more adjustment I had to make was getting used to a dedicated dvd eject button above the number keys again.  You can't just push in on the dvd play door any more.  Not a big deal and once I get use to it I'll be fine.  I really like the 1600 resolution option on this particular model, if your wondering about text size, my philosophy is that you can always turn up the zoom of the page to 125% and most web pages still fit on the screen.  The keyboard is nicely backlit and the keys have enough space between them so you don't hit two at once.  I only wish with the new hinge setup that it didn't have that plat in the rear of the laptop, it's centered and runs better than half way across and sticks out a bout an 1/8".  Not a big deal, but again, I liked the old style Sony hinge better personally.  The new hinge cover is finished nicely though, looks like brushed metal.  All of the input/output connections, except for the dvd player are on the right side of the laptop, I prefer this because it's easier for me to remember what side it's one.  There are 3 indicator lights in the front left and look nice.  There is a cap key light above the numbers.  The laptop feels well made to me and I have no regrets.

$review_text.: This review is for the 1.5tb version of this drive. I have a 2gb goflex drive that I purchased through Amazon around three years ago that works perfectly, so I expected this drive to be plug and play like that one was. Well it's not. I archive recorded football games that are around 2gb in size. I usually just drag them. Well, when I did this it would get about halfway through the transfer and then hang... At first I thought it was slowing down because of simultaneous internet usage, but the file would not finish the transfer.So I checked my connections and changed a few things and still a no go. I have an Intel I3 with 10gb of Ram. There is nothing wrong with the system. This hard drive simply does not work.Thank goodness there aren't issues with Amazon returns. I don't always read the reviews, because you have to take them with a grain of salt. Sometimes companies send people onto these boards to sway public opinion. I will say that after experiencing the troubles I did with this drive, straight out of the box, and reading the issues that others had, that Amazon should stop selling this drive and Seagate should recall them, because they are flawed to the extent that they are worthless and if I had lost valuable data due to this mess I would be really upset. If an external hard drive doesn't work straight out of the box, then it is worthless. I shouldn't have to jump through hoops to make data storage work and I don't think there is a hoop that can make this thing worth keeping.

The case is super tight, as some other reviewers noted you have to be careful with the zipper on the corners.  I found if you kind of pinch the case up over the corner then move the zipper past it is a little easier.  There is pretty much no extra room for any accessories, so if you need more than the laptop you may need something else.  For a basic case with a little padding, it is perfect.

$review_text.: This Bluetooth GPS unit works well and is simple to use

 I have not explored the more complex capabilities but I know that it locks on to satellites fairly quickly and doesn't lose them
 It even works indoors, though it is a bit slower than with a direct or near direct (like in a car) view of the sky
 The slower mode is plenty quick enough for basic use


 The faster mode almost seems real-time quick
 When traveling at highway speeds the map indicator moves along steadily and accurately


 The speed indicator derived from the GPS tracking nearly matched my vehicle's speedometer
 The battery is user replacable


 Unfortunately, as best I can tell the battery is not a common one so good luck finding a compatible one from anyone but the manufacturer.Other than the proprietary battery, I have no complaints.Update:  After several months the battery swelled up to the point where the battery compartment would not close

 If you get this device be careful to keep it (and the battery) from extreme temperatures for extended periods
 During the late winter I did have it in my vehicle for some periods and it got extremely cold at times


 I think the problem more so was caused by the hot summer temps in my care or body heat while in my pockets


 Fortunately I found an acceptable replacement battery for a decent price online from BatteriesInAFlash

 Search for a "BA-101" or "HXE-W01" battery.

If I had any complaint, it would be with the way it is designed to prop the tablet up at an angle.  It takes some practice and is not particularly secure when in position.All in all I highly recommend this case.

$review_text.: I almost didn't buy this sound machine because of the negative reviews.  But then I thought it looks good, fits my needs, and most people go online to complain when they write reviews, so it was worth a chance.  We are thrilled with it.  It's a nice size, a nice form factor and style, it produces very good, clear sound effects, and my favorite feature is by far the day and date on the unit!  There's nothing like know what day it is when you wake up bleary eyed!  It has a very good selection of clear sounds to choose from.  Previously we were using a fan for white noise, but in cold Chicago winters it was getting way too cold to do that; and it used a lot more electricity.  We laugh every time we hear the fog horn sound noise and wonder who would want that one, but I found the ocean waves and another water one the best for me.  I accidentally had it on the real radio static for a few days and it sounded like one of the sound effects, haha.  It's my favorite alarm clock that I've ever owned and the fact it's a sound machine + day/date just makes it perfect for me!  Thank you, Sharper Image!

The TV is not too heavy, the instructions were clear, and the on-screen menu was easy to follow.I have read several comments complaining about degraded picture if viewed from an angle and poor sound. I did not experience either with this TV. I viewed the screen from every angle, accept from the ceiling, and did not notice any change. Sound is crisp and clear with no annoying sound that others complained about.My biggest concern was possible reflection during the day since the TV would be in a brightly lit room with south facing windows and a glass door facing the screen. I was pleased to not see any of these reflected in the picture.I did my research before buying and believe I purchased a quality product at a terrific price.

There's two little buttons to take photos- one is to take one then and there, and the other gives you a five (or ten? Never counted) second head start before the camera fires. The other buttons on this remote are for when you plug your camera into a TV. You can have the control of shifting through the photos as you like, zooming in and zooming out. Just great.

$review_text.: This sound bar is advertised as "46-Inch Sound Bar", but note it's only about 40 inches wide. The 46 inches they're referring to are the diagonal measurement of the TV that matches the width of this sound bar. At 40 inches it's still a little wider than most sound bars, which seem to average about 38 inches.My TV is a thin Panasonic plasma, and the sound from the built-in speakers is incredibly bad, almost like there's a band-pass filter that filters out everything except human voices. Once I added this Sony sound bar the sound improved tremendously. It's not like having a 5.1-channel setup, but it's a great compromise for a typical TV room / living room situation where the wife might not approve of a miniature Stonehenge of speakers all around the room.

 We're using this in our bedroom up on a dresser
When lying down in bed, it's acceptable but it's borderline


I don't recommend this TV if it's intended to be up much higher unless it can be angled down


Our main larger JVC LCD TV and Viewsonic LCD monitor are pretty solid and don't degrade this bad


Not sure if this is an indicator of Vizio using cheap panels

For our viewing angle I'd give this a 3 rating but the pros bump it up to a 4.Pros:-Nice picture when viewed head on, plenty of adjustment options-Matte screen, no glare-It's 1080p
While it may be overkill for a screen this size, it certainly doesn't hurt
The larger 28&#34; version is only 720p and there are reviews complaining about its resolution.-Surprised how well the WiFi works connecting to a G router downstairs at the opposite end of the house.-Netflix works well and is the latest version-Nice menu system-Decent remote, slim frameNitpicks:-Sound is tinny but this was expected.-There's a guide button on the remote but it doesn't show much of the over-the-air EPG
It just shows the current show info but with a font size way too small to be readable across the room

Too bad most manufacturers don't at least have the ability to show and scroll through a simple Now and Next info for all the stations.-The way the Vizio logo hangs down on the right side is a bit goofy.-Amazon's app currently doesn't work but that fact is clearly stated on the site.

$review_text.: I have tried a number of headsets for MP3 and phone; I use a Plantronics for work (an older wired set) and I have tried Klipsch, Altec Lansing, and a few others to try to find the best headset for listening to books and music
The Plantronics BackBeat 216 Headset has some real advantages for the listener and they are comfortable in many ways


Here's what I like:1
Backbeat is right; there is some serious BASS going on here.2

Great separation of lows and highs


Clear highs, thumping bass


I used a New Age ambient work with a large dynamic and tonal range to test:Deep Roots Hidden Water.3
Sounds good for vocals such as audiobooks and opera, however, not as good as with music as above; these are really suited for pop and any music that has been mixed for optimum separation of sound (which is more typical of pop and less so for classical music.)4
GREAT ergonomic features; silicone earbuds

Ding for the cord; covered in woven material to prevent catching and tangling on itself


The cord doesn't tangle, but the woven cover is supposed to also prevent the rustling noise associated with cords on sound-occluding headsets when you move around


BUT, the noise from this cord, when you move around, is thunderous

Sad, as these are admirable otherwise.6

MICROPHONE! Yack on the phone or record your voice
Yes, this can be used with a phone/music player or can be used to voice over music or recorded material on your player or phone.7

For the price (well under fifty at this writing) a great value

My onlycomplaint is the hard wired adapter that plugs into the mp3 player,the wire seems thin. I hope this does not become an issue. However,I felt no need to give it less than 5 stars.

$REVIEW.: Purchased this unit to replace a Sony card that stoped working when I upgraded to Vista X64. Sony did not support drivers and Vista could not find any.Installation was easy and Vista loaded the needed drivers to work with Media Center with no problems for both TV and Radio. I downloaded the updated driver and software from Hauppauge. Don't bother, they are not needed and their software WinTV2000 does not work. Stick with Vista Media Center and avoid any problems.

$review_text.: The Sony DVP-CX995V. Hmmm. Let's get the obvious out of the way.Yes. It will play your movies, your CD's and MP3's. The picture and sound is more than acceptable.Yes. It will hold a lot of discs in a relatively compact space and eliminate clutter in your A/V / Home Theater Room.Saying that, the product falls short of being truly usable for its intended purpose. The interface is horrific...and that is coming from a confirmed gadget geek who loves to play with the latest electronic wonders. I am very disappointed that Sony would put a product like this on the market.Some of the simplest things you would expect of the DVP-CX995V are missing or very cumbersome. For example, it would seem obvious that with 400 discs, there would be some quick and efficient method to select a disc such as keying in the disc slot from the keypad. Wrong. You either manually turn the disc skip control on the unit, or repeatedly press the "disc skip" on the remote while the player sequential spins the carousel (or repeatedly paging through screens of titles on a television). Thankfully, on the player there is a button that allows you to skip 100 discs at a time so that you only have to manually go forward or backward, may be 50 slots. Yes. It is that primitive.------UPDATE - 2/03/2006 - I learned from another user the following shortcut (which is not documented):  With the remote switch set to "DVD", press the "Display / File" button on the remote.  This will bring up the Control Menu 1 screen with the number of the disc currently playing highlighted in the first entry.  Pressing the "Enter" button on the remote will clear the number and allow you to key in a new disc number.  Press the "Enter" button and the player should now begin the process of changing to the disc you selected.  Press the "Display / File" button until the menu screen toggles off.------The unit does not allow you to enter and save programs for favorite CD's. The closest you can do is to categorize the discs by artist, genre, etc and then select that group to play. This information needs to be keyed into the player. However, a disc (slot) can only be assigned to one category. This leads to the next item.The highly touted ability to enter and create a library of title information is flawed because the player loses its memory if it is without power for less than 24 hours. I live in Florida...this is an issue. Even if you live in an area which has stable power, what if you want to move or unplug the unit? It boggles my mind that in an era when you can buy 128MB of non-volatile flash memory for less than $20, why does this unit have this problem?.------UPDATE - 2/03/2006 - I have started the process of entering disc information of my DVD collection into the player.  You have two options: (1) Insert all your discs into the player at the same time and hit the "Load" button on the front panel of the player.  The player then sequentially mounts every disc in the player and attempts to  read disc information if it is available.  As others have pointed out, probably less than 10% of current discs have any information so this doesn't buy you much.  You will then need to use a keyboard to enter title information for the remaining discs, as well as artist, genre and selecting a folder if you want to use that options.  BTW, you cannot just select a slot number and begin to type in data and then put the disc into the slot.  The player must load every disc first before it will allow you to enter any data.  Apparently the player must know what type of disc is in the slot first (it will categorize disc type automatically - DVD, CD, CD-Data, etc.) If you have been following this process, you should recognize a problem...how do you know what disc information to enter (unless you have already written it out and carefully inserted the discs into the proper slot number)?  This means you will have likely have to wait for the player to again mount the disc, wait through the interminable FBI warnings, etc before you can determine what disc is playing in order to enter the title information.  (2)The second option which I have been doing is to load 10 - 15 discs at time, hit play and wait for the player to spin the discs around to the back and allow it to mount and begin reading the disc.  At that point, with the remote selector switch in the "Disc Explorer" position, I hit the "Stop" button and then press the "Folder" button which brings upon the "Disc Explorer" menu.  I keep the empty disc cases in the same order as I loaded the discs and then enter then disc information for the current disc.  Once the data is saved, you index down to the next slot on the "Disc Explorer" menu , press play, wait while the player dismounts the current disc and then mounts the new disc and starts reading. Etc. Etc. Etc.  Expect to spend 2 minutes total for each disc you want to file.  I currently have approximately 300 DVD's in my library.  An Excel spreadsheet is starting to look pretty attractive.  One other oddity, if the disc does have text information, the player will not allow you to edit or override it.  My DVD of "Independence Day" has a title of "ID4" which the player picks up and will not allow me to correct.------By the way, the DVP-CX995V is s-l-o-w to mount and read a disc. Forget about shuffle play of tracks between CD discs.I was disappointed to learn that this player will not read MP3's from DVD media like the other current Sony players do. Given the slowness of the unit, it would be nice to collapse 30 or 40 albums of music onto a single DVD but it is not there.Yes, the player forces you to wait 20-30 seconds upon startup while it loads and reads the information from the last disc played....whether you want to play it or not. This is such a simple bug...why doesn't Sony fix it.Yes. You will need to read the manual. This must be the least intuitive machine I have ever used. "Steep learning curve" would be an understatement. After playing with it for over a week, I don't understand what Sony was thinking about when they designed the DVP-CX995V. It doesn't have to be this hard.Not really a weakness but be sure your cabinent or shelving is strong and large enough. The unit is over 21 inches deep. With video component cables extended out the back, you should allow at least another 1-2 inches. Think about how heavy 400 DVD/CD discs weigh and add-in the weight of the player.Prior to buying this player, I read some of the negative reviews and thought they were written by the sort of person who gets confused setting up a VCR or using a remote control. Well, I was wrong. In fact, I don't understand the positive reviews that you will find listed.Bottom line. Unless you must have a player that can store 400 pieces of media, avoid the DVP-CX995V. Save your money and peace of mind. You will thank me. Hear me now...believe me later.------UPDATE - 02/03/2006 - After owning for over a month, my opinion hasn't really changed much about the DVP-CX995V.  Video and audio performance are OK but nothing to get excited about.  Although I am starting to learn and get use to its quirks and limitations, I'm not sure if it is worth all the trouble because it is so unusable.  Definitely a niche product.  On the other hand, when you consider all that it does, at $300 it isn't a bad deal.  Still, I would not recommend this product without reservations.
$SUMMARY.: Not one of Sony's better efforts.

$review_text.: Information you may find useful:1


 Bracketron is coming out with a new Nav-Mat 2, the UFM-464-BL


 I don't know what will make this unit different
 This may be why the UFM-210-BL is being discounted from its retail price of $30 in many places

 Having said that, the picture of this new unit on the Bracketron site looks the same as the 210


 But it is very hard to tell from a little picture about significant subtleties that may differentiate these units.2


 Some have found problems with the 210 letting go of the dash
 There are even pictures documenting this on the Amazon site
 GPS units with a center of mass far forward of their suction cups are more prone to this problem

 Also, a dash with a substantive forward tilt will make the problem more likely


 I have a Toyota Prius
 It's dash is made of a normal, and according to Bracketron, acceptable dash material

 However, I too have experience this problem

 Within a mile of driving, the back of the Nav-Mat began to pull away from my dash

 The Prius dash is very flat

 Which should be good for the Nav-Mat II
 However, my GPS holder is configured so that the center of mass is extended forward of the suction cup and this does appear to exert too much torque on the mat to keep it flat on the dash
 I believe the Nav-Mat II is simply too light for units like mine
 Interestingly, my GPS holder was only supporting a relatively small iPhone 4S
 So...Beware.3
 I contacted Amazon for a return
 NO PROBLEMS!  Amazon was terrific
 I would definitely recommend buying this product from Amazon in case you experience the same problem as I and others have with the Nav-Mat II letting go

 If that happens, you will have no hassles whatsoever returning the unit and getting a full refund.Hope some of this has been of help.Cheers, Mr


Luigi


$SUMMARY.: Will work for SOME GPS units

 Definitely buy from Amazon in case you need to return.

Sees my network, stays locked on, no issues in 2 months.  Netflix HD plays fine with digital audio and 1080P upres.  Even DVDs look very good on my Panasonic 60&#34; plasma.  I am also, playing a lot of &#34;.mkv&#34; files via USB.  Playback is similar to discs, with no jumping or other problems.  The GUI is very easy to use and move around with no complicated nested menus.  Only thing I have found that could be better is the ability (like my TV)  to use a keyboard.  Putting in your network name and PIN is a pain with the remote!

$REVIEW.: Bought this to replace the stock cooler on a AMD Phenom II X4 965. I bought a 120 MM Delta along with it to replace the stock fan. (Read several reviews where the stock fan failed) I must say having the motherboard control that fan and the great low temps it brings are just wonderful. Used the included paste as it seemed better than what I had on hand. Temperatures dropped from 105F (with stock cooler on full blast) to 85F on idle and the fans not at full speed. With a game running temps go up to about 97F and under heavy scenarios the fan picks up and temps level out around 115F. I would recommend this and the 120mm Delta fan as a replacement should your stock one fail.

$review_text.: 1 star due to the damage this mobo caused even BEFORE turning the power on.After assembly, the VGA plug didn't want to go in to this mobo's VGA socket.I checked the jack and it IS in the matching orientation. So I used some force.It finally went in. But I felt something weird right then.So, I pulled out the jack and checked it. I found that one of the VGA pins in the jack is completely bent insidethe metal sleeve. I checked the mobo side VGA port using magnifier. One of the holes (in matching positionto the bent pin) is apparently smaller than the other holes and too tight for the pin to slide in! Thus the damage.I couldn't believe it. The holes are in the injected piece of plastic so aren't they supposed to be the same always?No one seems to be complaining about the same problem either...To make the matter worse, in an attempt to straighten out the pin using a small tip tweezers, the tip completely broke off...I stopped right there and started to take this mobo off the chassis to send it straight back to AMAZON.Thanks Amazon for its easy return process but the product gets only 1 star.

$REVIEW.: I have had other cases for my Pen PM1 that I loved! but this one not so much.  On my EPL1 it just doesn't fit that snug around the body, and too snug on the lens.  Overall I like my camera better with it than without it, but am thinking about returning it and looking more.With the 14-42mm kit lens, whenever I pull the case off the lens cap is pulled off too.  I thought I lost the cap in a restaurant today but luckily looked under the table and saw the cap had fell under my feet without me noticing.  It has happened several other times that either the cap is left behind in the leather case, or else it springs out when I pull the case off.  Maybe I'll get the feel of a method to remove the case that doesn't cause this problem.Secondly the case isn't very form fit to the body. Like pictures show, there is a big gap on the side if you're using the EPL1.  Not pretty and not as solid as I'd like.

Part of the success might lie with the Mustang's antennae being located on the hood right by the dashboard.That said, I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, as it just isn't as good as a direct aux hookup

$review_text.: I needed a formal keyboard for my Nexus 10 being that I sometimes use my tablet for quick reports and notes.  I felt a physical keyboard would fare better than the on-screen touch one for those type of situations.  Plus, I needed a quality keyboard for my N10 and not one of those cheap case-keyboard hybrids.  I decided to choose this Logitech keyboard, and it works perfectly.  No delay when typing--keystrokes are smooth and natural.  Great bluetooth keyboard!
$review_summary.: Perfect for my usage.

$REVIEW.: After buying our Sharp AQUOS Quattron 70 inch TV (Model LC-70C8470U), we needed additional 3D glasses to complement the two that came with the TV so we bought 2 of these.  If you need IR compatible 3D glasses for your Sharp TV, definitely consider these because they work great with the TV.  We recently found that the Playstation 3 3D glasses are also compatible with our Sharp TV and are less than half the price of these Sharp ones. We ordered 2 of the Sony Playstation 3 3D glasses from Amazon and found them to work just as well. They are also rechargeable.  We now own 6 3D glasses which should work out well for group viewing.
$review_summary.: These work well, but we found a less expensive alternative

$REVIEW.: I think many folks would agree that for the past year the Samsung has been the state of the art when it comes to Chromebooks.  I own two of them and both my wife and I have been quite happy using them.  For her, it represents a primary machine where she is able to do 99% of what she ever needs with a computer, e.g., email, Facebook, Pinterest, etc.  For me, it has been a great secondary machine which I use primarily for writing when I am away from my office.As much as I have liked my Samsung Chromebook, it has always felt like it was just 95% of the way there.  My issue has always been that the performance was a little slower than it should be.  Rather than smoothly navigating between windows and around the web, it always felt like it was lagging a second behind my performance expectations.  My wife doesn't notice and doesn't mind because it is all she ever uses and it feels perfectly fine for her.  For me, however, after spending 10 hours a day working on a fantastic Macbook Pro I can distinctly feel the difference when I downshift to my Samsung at home at night.  It was good enough for my use cases that I didn't mind enough to pursue my most likely alternative (buy a Macbook air), but it rankled nonetheless.Well, I am happy to report that the architecture improvements with the C720 have absolutely removed all of those concerns.  I've been using my new C720 extensively since it arrived a couple days ago and I am happy to report that in my mind it is an absolutely perfect machine for what I use it for.  It navigates the web with aplomb with the same snappy performance as my MacBook.  The Google Docs apps are absolutely perfect for my needs when I am away from my office.  My company uses Office 365 so I can even use the web versions of the MS Office Suite in those rare circumstances where I can't meet my needs with Google Docs.Side-by-side with the Samsung I find the machines to be more similar than not.  The design of the Samsung is marginally more sleek and attractive, but we aren't comparing a sports car to an 18-wheeler here.  The design of the Acer is just fine, at least to my eyes.  As for usage, I actually prefer the keyboard and trackpad on the Acer to the Samsung, though both of those are clearly features that are highly subjective in terms of how people experience them.  I read some reviews that complained about the build quality of the Acer, but I will say that I actually find it to feel much more "solid" than the Samsung which was always just a smidgen too "plasticky" for me.If you have a Samsung and think it is a perfect machine then I would not bother buying a C720.  I am not planning to replace my wife's, though I am guessing that might change if she ever gets the chance to use my C720 and actually notices the difference.  If you have a Samsung and it has always felt just a little bit slow, then by all means grab one of these as soon as they are in stock.  It is a near perfect machine for word processing, simple spreadsheets and web surfing.  I cannot in a million years imagine spending a grand for a Macbook Air when I can have this guy for 20 to 25% of that price.  I make that comparison because that was the choice I was making to solve my particular problem...I want a great machine that I can use when I am away from my desk and need to write or surf the web.  I would have kept using the Samsung in that scenario by just eating the aggravation I felt over its performance, but it would have always bugged me.  The C720, on the other hand, is the perfect Chromebook and actually a perfect computer as long as your use cases match its vast capabilities.  These things are almost perfect enough that I am even starting to consider deploying them within my company for our sales reps to use.
$SUMMARY.: I think we've found the Samsung killer

$REVIEW.: For the price the sound is very good and the volume control works well

 I hope it lasts


 I would recommend these for indoor use only, as the volume control doesn't feel very robust despite being quite large

 I was disappointed in the fit

 The pads are quite small


 It seems like a larger diameter would be more comfortable

 The headband also seems long
 I always have them on the smallest click and they still ride a little too low
 I can't imagine how big your head would have to be to require you to expand them

 I'm keeping them though as I'm sure all their competitors have their own issues
 FWIW I have a pretty normal cap size 7 1/4 and wear a medium to large motorcycle helmet.

$review_text.: I have been using the SoundDock since 3 weeks now and I am satisfied! . Bose made some minor changes in this SoundDock series II by introducing the auxillary input.Sound quality is great and the clarity of the vocals amazed me. As opposed to the original SoundDock which was portable and priced at $399 , this one cannot run on a battery.Most reviewers here had complaints about the auxillary input and now they have got it at the cost of portability.Obviously  my concern with this product is why did they remove the battery powering capability. I guess BOSE does not remove the outdated models.If this sounddock came with the same features as the Original Sounddock+AuxIn with the same price($399), it would have been great!The manual does not contain any specifications on power output/bass capability etc as is the tradition with Bose systems.All in all a good buy but not truly portable!

$REVIEW.: It is very hard to rate a router on its second day of use, however, I can always keep this review updated as many of other folks have done so.So, firstly, why I upgraded.  I upgraded from Cisco/Linksys E4200 router, which was a few years old, and was choking up and unable to keep with the streaming needs of NetFlix, Amazon Prime, and HBO Go.ASUS 68U came highly recommended, a bit pricey though.  I received the unit yesterday and hooked it up.  The setup was painless.  I wanted to mimic what I had before, three networks.  One using 802.11 AC for fast lane streaming, second one for supporting old devices using operating at 2.4 Ghz, and the third one for guests' internet access, keeping them away from the house network.  All this was possible in the old Cisco/Linksys router, and ASUS provided the similar setup with no surprises.  Once the setup was complete, the Internet speed over Wifi was blazingly fast, as claimed by ASUS.A small hurdle came when my eight years old Buffalo Wireless to Ethernet converter refused to connect to the two internal networks I had setup.  The reason being, the legacy device, needed to use TKIP encryption.  To do this, you must first change the authentication method to WPA-Auto-Personal, and then the drop down list for authentication will give you two choices.  Choose TKIP+AES (Old+New.)In addition to all this, I setup a few NATs, related to my work.  This is where I found some annoying things about this router.1. On the CISCO I could simply disable an existing NAT setting.  On ASUS unit, I must delete it, if not in use, which means when I want to use it again, I have to enter the same details again.2. For changes to NAT etc. the router basically restarts itself, which may take up to a 45-50 seconds.  Agreed, these changes are not made on a daily basis, however, if I am enabling and disabling NAT for my FTP server, this delay could be annoying.  This is where the disable feature mentioned above could come handy.3. There is no way turn off the logging.  Any logging comes at a cost to the performance.What I really love about the interface is the dashboard.  Everything I want to know like my WAN address, current devices connected to the router etc. is readily available under Network Map.Over all it seems like a decent purchase.  I am taking away one star for the features I had to sacrifice from my old router.
$SUMMARY.: Superfast and easy to setup!

$review_text.: I bought this for myself for Christmas and have been very happy and satisfied with my choice. All the research indicated that this would be a good choice and it has clearly ended up being just what I read about and expected. I did research on the one LCD I bought a year previously to replace one of the other CRT style TV that decided to end its life back then. At that time the LD models were considered a good selection. I bought one and have regretted it since. So when I looked at the ratings and feedback on the Samsung and saw similar feedback and ratings, I was cautiously hopeful. I like this model so much that when I have been asked to make a recommendation at work for our departments, I have suggested the Samsung LED HDTV models. Four new purchases have been made at work and they are all Samsung LED HDTV. Everyone is happy and my recommendations and trust remain high.

$REVIEW.: I bought one of these several years ago and had it set up within 2 minutes.  It worked flawlessly all the way up until it got stolen three days ago (which is why I'm here buying another).  It is extremely convenient to be able to play music from a USB drive instead of having to worry about compatibility with various audio devices (or certain devices becoming obsolete).  The quality is great and the transmission had a radius of up to 100 meters in certain areas, so my friends could actually listen to my transmission from several car lengths away.The only frustrating thing about this device, which is why I rated it at 4 in ease of use instead of 5, is that there is no easy way to search and sort music.  You can separate your music into directories and scroll file-by-file or folder-by-folder.  Even with hundreds of songs on my USB stick, this was a relatively minor issue once I sorted my music into folders.  I can't wait to get another one!

$REVIEW.: I bought this to use on my tablet (an Asus Transformer TF101) to backup some of my data before I flashed a custom ROM. Works as expected out of the box; no formatting or fiddling needed. It comes with an SD card adapter and a little plastic case for it and the adapter. Android and the recovery kernels I've used have no trouble detecting whatever the default filesystem is on it.The one thing I would note: if you have an older SD card reader on your computer, it may not be able to read HC or XC micro SD cards. You may want to check if your read supports them.I recommend this to anyone who needs a SD or micro SD card for any purpose. It's cheap, tiny, and has massive storage capacity for it's size, so long as your device supports it.

$review_text.: I won't go into the technical details of this lens but rather a history of this lens and how I finally got a focusing Sigma 30mmCanon 20D:  Initially, this lens was paired with my Canon 20D.  The first set would not focus correctly.  Using the Amazon refund policy, I attained a second set.  This one seemed to be focusing better but still had a tendency to front focus.Canon 40D:  Ironically, when I got a new body, the lens focusing abilities performed poorly; it front focused.  After doing some research and reading up on how others attained a good copy, I decided to go ahead and send in the lens for calibration.  I have read in forums that many have sent in their lens for calibration were disappointed.  However, those who sent in their lens WITH their camera were almost always happy with the result.  Therefore, I sent in my lens with my 40D body.Service and warranty:  The calibration process was extremely fast.  They recieved my package Thursday afternoon.  I called Sigma Friday afternoon to check up on the status.  I expected that they haven't even gotten around to my package yet.  However, I was notified that they had already calibrated and sent it back my way.  I received a tracking number and received it promptly afterwards.  The service was excellent.  The service was free of charge because the warranty covers the services.  The warranty for the EX line of lenses, which this lens falls under, has a 4 year total warranty.Result:  I was very surprised.  The whole time it was on the canon 20d, I thought that the lens was focusing perfectly.  However, when it came back calibrated, I finally found out what I was missing out on.  I can shoot at 1.4 with little hesitation.  It has gotten much better at focusing in dark rooms.Conclusion:Unfortunately, the truth is that there is a high probably that your copy of this lens may have focussing issues.  When I finally obtained a copy that works on my 20D, it turned out that it didn't work correctly with a new body (40D); there are no guarantees that this lens will work from one body to another.  There is a high level of uncertainty about the quality of this lens.  However, the service is quick for calibration and often no hassle.  If you want a crop sensor standard lens for a bargain, buy one with the possibility that you may need to get it calibrated.  It is really not a big deal.  Like many things in life, you have the choice to look at the cup half full.  Within a few days, I was able to enjoy a crop sensor standard prime lens that focuses fast and accurately.I know what the pushback is.  If you purchase a lens of this price and caliber, everything should work perfectly.  Largely, I am in total agreement with you.  Why should I dish out 500 dollars for something the may not work properly?  However,  keep in mind what your options are.  If you are a canon user, you have the choice of the 35L or a 24mm and 28mm, neither of which is f1.4 or close to 50mm.  If you are a canon user like me and unless you can afford the 35L, this is really your only choice for a fast and large aperture crop sensor standard.  This lens really is a bargain for what it is capable of, f1.4, equivalent 50mm (48mm actual) and a fast focusing motor (HSM).Buy it and cross your fingers. Be it that it should mis-focus, then get yourself a new copy but should the second copy do likewise, send it in for calibration with your body.  It's a small inconvenience but it will be worth your time.Thanks for reading

Every time I tried turning it on it made a click sound as if it wanted to turn on but nothing, the red light kept blinking and blinking, from what I read from past models it seems like it was a circuit board.At this point I'm returning the second set and go with another brand, what a shame because the picture quality is very good.

This is my Gigabyte board after being disgusted with ASUS for so many failures . These SATA PORTS ARE NOT ATTACHED TO THE BOARD?&#62;? Just metal strips? Guess how I found out. I was changing the AHCI to IDE in my registry and doing the reboot. I went into the BIOS and changed my mode from NATIVE IDE to AHCI. I saved and restarted the computer. I get a 0xc000000e  A device is inaccessible. I got back into the BIOS and two drives are missing,. I have a 4X SATA III card with 4 more drives. I went and checked the sata cables and pressed the lock on the cable and it slipped out of my hand because the port literally bent 45 degrees. Turns out all of the connectors point straight up and I saw they are pointing at different angles because they are not attached except by the wires, except they are more like strips. The metal was still attached to the SATA cable. I got this on Black Friday. What a major pain.

$REVIEW.: I bought this product a few months ago, but ultimately had to sell it and purchase a Ceton InfiniTV


 The device is easy to set up, provides three tuners, which is more than your average cable DVR, and works well with Windows Media Center in both Windows 7 and 8

 The device worked well 95% of the time, but the remaining 5% was plagued by buffering / pixelation issues and tuner not available issues

 I have a fast gigibit network thatfunctions very well, so I was a bit surprised by teh buffering / pixelation issues

 I spent hours trying to resolve it (great customer service from SiliconDust), but overall was not able to solve it.I would definitely recommend this product to anyone out there, even with the minor issues

$REVIEW.: I ordered the PlaySport a little over a month ago for a 4-day hike on the Appalachian Trail
The durability and waterproof features of the camera enticed me to ordering it two days before we left and get it shipped overnight


After reading a large portion of the other reviews here on Amazon, I also ordered two spare batteries for it.This thing shoots in beautiful quality
For a demonstration of the camera, you can view this video ([...]), which is of our first day heading to the Appalachian Trail


All of it was shot with the PlaySport at 720p and 30 fps
We were on the trip for 8 days (4 on the trail, 3 traveling, and 1 day of rest/relaxation)

During the four days hiking, I was most concerned about battery life
My three batteries did, however, last me the entire four days

I went through two batteries completely, and was most of the way through the third
I shot a large amount of video each day, however, and most people would have probably allowed the three batteries to last 5 or 6 days


I was certainly glad to find an electrical outlet at our campsite once we got off the trail for charging my batteries, though!Memory wasn't a huge issue for me, but I happen to have two 4 GB memory cards as well as a 16 GB card, all of which I brought on the Trail

Days 1-5 (which included 1 day of travel and 4 of hiking) almost filled the 16 GB card


I filled it on Day 6, but one of the 4 GB cards lasted me until the end of the trip


The 16 GB card, when empty, holds just over 4 hours of video in 720p and 30 fps (Based off this information, the three batteries probably lasted about 3 1/2 hours, or just over an hour each

I didn't do much, if any, video playback on the camera on the Trail to save battery life).On that same AT trip, we encountered a fair bit of rain
It was so cool to be able to still film in the rain

I even set the camera down on the ground at one point for an awesome shot of the rain coming straight down
I did not submerge or test the limits of the camera on that trip, as it was still a fairly new camera.Since then, a friend of mine held the camera while falling into a pool (on purpose and with my permission) for a video we are shooting
The camera held up perfectly and gave us an angle we couldn't have gotten with almost any other camera

Now, at this point, I still hadn't really tested the camera much, so we only did one quick fall into the pool with my PlaySport.Even more recently, my family and I took a trip to the Florida Keys


I went snorkeling twice for 40 minutes each time, and each time kept the PlaySport under the water almost the entire time
I was able to film all sorts of neat fish and even a nurse shark! On the same trip, on a jet-skiing tour of Key West, I kept the camera attached to my life vest and was able to get an awesome angle on that endeavor as well

None of this would have been possible with a standard pocket camera or even a standard camera!There is a weird quirk with the zoom, which I also read on someone else's review, so I know it is not just a weird glitch on my camera


When zooming in, about 2/3 of the way zoomed in, the image sort of "jumps", then continues zooming


Not sure if this is indicative of the switch from optical to digital zoom or whatnot, but the same also happens when zooming back out, in the same place
This is just a minor little quirk that has rarely affected any of my clips.As for low-light performance, there are definitely better cameras
It is hard to see or make out pretty much anything in a dark room, and the image seems to get grainy as evening turns into night
But once again, this hasn't really affected me

It's still a decent quality, but not nearly as good as in well-lit situations, like a video shoot or even just outdoors or indoors with decent lighting.I have felt that at times, the 30 fps setting can be a bit shaky
It's not terrible, and the 60 fps clears it up (and takes up a lot more memory), but for best use of the camera, use a tripod or camera boom (I used a StickPic on the Appalachian Trail, see [...] for more information)


This tends to greatly increase the stability, but even just handheld, the camera works pretty well (but ONLY if the camera's EIS is on).I've been fairly pleased with the mic on the PlaySport

For things like video shoots where I have the option to, I'm going to still use my professional condenser microphone on a boom, but the mic has surprised me
On the jet ski trip mentioned early, I could actually hear myself speaking over the noise of the engine (going about 40 mph) and the roar of the water, and could easily make out what I was saying


It isn't easy to hear people from a far distance (more than 20 feet, I'm guessing), but for most videoing, that isn't an issue.All in all, I am very happy with my PlaySport
I'm definitely using it for every video I shoot in the future, especially things that require a durable (or waterproof!) camera

If I could go back and buy this camera again, I would do it in an instant! Best pocket camera I've ever seen or dealt with! (By the way, for more videos filmed with my PlaySport, look for anything uploaded in late June or July on [...])

The only problem is that the case is a little short and barely fits the Nexus 10 inside


When you zip it shut, the zipper seems like it rests on the side of the tablet rather than have some sort of cushioning to protect that specific side.Other than that it is a pretty good sleeve!

$REVIEW.: Please be aware the lens does not come with the hood.  That must be purchased separately.  The picture, on this page, is a bit misleading.We'll start of with the greatness of this lens.  This lens is the best constructed m4/3 yet.  It is optically amazing and fast.  The autofocus is ultra silent and quick (I only have Pani bodies).  The feel of this lens is magnificent.  When you pull back the ring to manual focus, it has hard stops and the focus speed is variable depending on how fast you turn the ring.  While not up to the quality of Leica (what is?), this lens is a true gem.  There are currently only 2 m43 lenses that go this wide (7-14 and 9-18) and they are bigger, heavier, and 2 stops slower.  I am not sure why the m43 bunch is caught up on the 28mm length but this lens is a welcome step in the right direction.So if this lens is so nice, then what is the dilemma?  The answer to that would be the Panasonic 14mm f/2.5.  The 14mm is not in the same league as the 12mm for build quality.  However, it is much smaller and cheaper.  (Not that the 12mm f/2 is that big in fact it is tiny for what it is, the 14mm f/2.5 is just tiny.)  If you don't need the extra Field of View (FOV) of the 12mm then the 14mm is a very good alternative.  I just got back from shooting at two automotive museums and the 14mm performed admirably.  It was rare I needed a wider FOV.  However, for tight location shooting this thing is an absolute gem and now offers a m43 shooter a real professional alternative to a Nikon or Canon equivalent.  Now it would be possible to tote the D7000 w/ 70-200mm f/2.8 and a G3 w 12mm f/2.  Much lighter than another Nikon DX body with 14-24 f/2.8 or FX body with 24mm f/1.4.Overall, if you don't know why you would need this lens over the Pani 14mm f/2.5, then you don't.  However, if you need the 9 deg extra FOV or you merely want to use a world class lens then you will be very happy with 12mm f/2.  Bravo Olympus.  Now please make a 35-100mm f/2 for m43.Pros:Great 24mm equivalent focal lengthBy far the best build quality of any m43 lens yetOptically outstandingFast silent autofocusBest handling of any m43 lens yetBeautiful to look at and holdConsQuite a bit pricer than the Pani 14mm f/2.5 (It is actually reasonably priced if you compare it to Voigtlander, Zeiss, or even Nikon and it will get cheaper)Bigger than Pani 14mm f/2.5 (Takes a Panasonic G3 out of the compact camera size into Mega Zoom camera size range)There are no real cons of this lens as it is outstanding.  However, for most people the Pani 14mm will be the smarter purchase (14mm + 20mm still cheaper than 12mm)

$review_text.: I've owned a number of other MP3 players and have made a concerted effort to avoid "iPod madness."  But with the recent price drop and upgrade of the battery life, I decided to take the plunge.  I bought mine through the Apple store and got free engraving as well as free shipping.All-in-all, I LOVE my new 4gb iPod mini.  I also like that I can import my MusicMatch Jukebox playlists into iTunes rather easily.There are really, in my opinion, only a few negatives:~ Dock is no longer included.  However, the included USB cable works fine IF you have a powered USB port on your PC.~ The included ear-buds are AWFUL!  Fortunately I had several pairs of good headphones floating around, so that was not a big issue for me.I would recommend picking up the USB power adapter and the Insten iPod Sync & Charging cradle.  I would also recommend checking out the iLounge web site for lots of good information on the care and feeding of your iPod.Oh!  One other negative is that these things ARE addictive. And I'm kinda thinkin' now that should have gone for the 20gb version.

$REVIEW.: Historically, I have purchased the best hardware available in an effort to improve my productivity.  So, I when I transitioned from a desktop with a 15k rpm nine years ago to a notebook with a 5,400 rpm drive, the performance hit was a real disappointment.  Hence, I was more than happy to spring for a an Intel X25-M to make my HP Elitebook Mobile workstation even faster. Generally, I have been happy with the performance of X25-M but not astounded like other users.The principle reason I have spent so much on hardware is to improve the performance of one particularly disk- and processor-intensive application -- X1, which is a real-time, fast-as-you-type indexing application.  Over the years, it has felt like an arms race: I get better and better hardware but the volume of indexable documents keeps increasing, slowing down X1 and overall operation of the computer. Meanwhile, Microsoft chooses to make increasingly bloated software necessitating ever faster hardware.  My latest notebook is an HP Elitebook mobile workstation with x9100 3.06 GHZ dual core processor, 4 GB of RAM, and a 7200 rpm drive running on Windows Utimate 64 bit.  Out of the box, it seemed oddly sluggish on occasions due to either X1 or some application that HP installed.  Given the specs and the cost of the notebook, I was a bit surprised it wasn't faster. Wanting to avoid the hassle of purchasing another extremely expensive notebook, I decided the simplest approach to improving overall performance would to purchase the X25-M.My two major reasons for hesitating to purchase the X25-M were the meager 160 GB capacity and unpleasant memories of upgrading drives in the past.  Remarkably, the installation was painless using Acronis true image using only my HP notebook.  Moreover, Acronis offers a fully functional free demo that worked without a hitch.  I did need to purchase an external USB/eSata enclosure (Acomdata Tango) to connect to my existing notebook to complete the process, however. This too worked without a problem.  In total, I was pleasantly surprised at how easy the process given that no second computer was used.While I haven't precisely timed various operations, the X25-M is clearly faster than the previous 7200 rpm drive.  However, I haven't been overwhelmed by the performance like other users. There is still some hesitation when opening large files. Also, Windows 7 Ultimate takes a significant amount of time to load even though it is faster than with the 7200 rpm drive. Note this is even with disabling many services and startup applications.  Truthfully, I have to wonder if it has something to do with software HP installed or just the bloated operating system.There are some noticeable improvements. Most Office documents open much faster (2-3x).  Critical for my particular situation is that X1 ties up the computer much less frequently.  The initial indexing and optimizing (275k documents and 126k email messages) is significantly faster, perhaps as much as 3x. Opening 100 MB Filemaker databases is easily 3x faster.  Creation of new records in Filemaker is similarly as fast.My overall opinion is that the X25-M is an excellent SSD albeit at significant expense and with less than ideal capacity.  If cost isn't a problem but space is, I would suggest relocating files to an external drive to free up some space.  The cost/space/performance tradeoffs make the investment worthwhile.ProsVery fast, uniquely fast for certain applicationsEasy installationShock resistantNo defragmentation necessaryCons160 GB too small enoughExpensiveCould be even fasterSystemHP Elitebook Mobile Workstation 8530wX9100 Dual Core Processor @ 3.06 GHz4 GB RAM7200 RPM drive upgraded to 160 GB X25-MWindows Ultimate 64 Bit

$REVIEW.: Great keyboard with one major flaw.  First the good:- Soft touch keys that are not loose (see cheap dell keyboard for misery).- The wireless aspect is nice! Not a big deal but the lack of cable and reducing clutter is nice for a clean workspace!- standard placement of the arrow keys and the home,  end, insert, delete, page up, and page down keys.  I think where they put these is great.  All keyboards should have them there.The bad:- Esc and Function keys!!  Why on earth did they make them smaller than the normal sized keys?!  I frequently hit cntrl-esc to bring up the start menu in windows.  I also hit esc key a LOT during programming or just regular navigating. The esc key is not only small but recessed so it's very hard to hit accurately and with out searching.  That's really frustrating.  IF they simply made the esc key a normal size and left all other Function keys (F1, F2, ...) undersized, I wouldnt have cared.  But the esc key is used as much as the rest.- The setup.  I dont use their mouse, I use the Logitech wireless. I wish the setup was smart enough to see that I dont have a microsoft mouse attached and simply disable it in the setup.

$REVIEW.: I love this filter! I use it with all sunny photos with my Sony Cybershot DSC-H1.  The color accuracy is tremendously improved and removes the blue hue so typical of most digital cameras in the moderate or low price range.  A more expensive Canon or Nikon probably wont require a filter like this one, but if you have the large lens, large format CCD like the Sony DSC-H1 then this filter will balance out the hue tremendously.  The color accuracy will vary, depending on the light level recieved in auto modes, so a little color balancing may be needed in post-processing (either black or white, or both) on your computer, however, this filter corrects most problematic color and flaring problems associated with digital cameras.  The DSC-H1 is prone to contrast too high on it's own, but this polarizer corrects that and helps bring out the details in clouds and boldens the reds and browns.  You will find you will have to actually raise the midtones in post-processing to make the photos more realisitc, but, I'd rather have to do this than have every photo ruined by over-exposure.  White colors might turn out to be slightly sepia, but that, too, can be corrected, or you might find that the occasional sepia shift is a little "artsy".  Either way, it's all good.  In short the filter keeps you from over-exposing (in most cases), re-balances color in most photos and makes digital photos look more like film.  It's defintitely worth the money...and oh yes...it is a circular polarizer because when I can see through it in a mirror and then flip it over, it goes dark in the mirror, indicating a true circular polarization.
$SUMMARY.: Great filter to warm up any digital camera with a blue hue

I'm not sure how you could do better in terms of value. They are crisp and clear at all volume levels and with all types of audio, from YouTube to iTunes to Windows Media Player. They come with an oval plastic piece around which you can loop excess cord, which is a nice accessory that I didn't see mentioned in the product description. The cord is long and, since I use them sitting at the desk, the ability to neatly loop the extra cord instead of having it hanging loose is helpful.

$review_text.: I've read a lot of review here, wow! Some people are so critical

 This is a great system, especially if you're a college student on a budget


 Someone said that it had so few imputs, do your research before you buy buddy
 My only real gripe was the fact that the speaker wire is connected to the speakers, and it wasn't long enough
 I took care of this problem by buying a Rocketfish wireless reciever and plugged the rear speakers into it, problem solved and works great (if you do this, autocal your system direct before using the wireless unit)


 Another person had a gripe about playing music on the system
 I have a Zune with the media dock plugged into the system, the sound is crystal clear, I'm amazed by the clairity of sound


 Several people have had gripes about having to turn up the volume way high


 For music 35-45 is perfect for most styles of music

 For movies around 55 is a great setting
 I live in dorm, people live above and around me, and I live in a smaller space, insanely loud volume settings aren't necessary

 If your viewing spot is in a large room and you've got a lot of money to work with, this system probably isn't for you

 However, if your a college student living in a smaller space on a lower budget, I highly recommend this system, it's perfect.

$review_text.: I bought these cords as my Apple cords have frayed

 Good price so I figured I'd try these
 Both sets have connection issues
 I use one for charging my iphone and one to connect my ipod to my audio system

 In both cases the cords need a little jiggling to get it to connect or charge and then my ipod disconnects while listening here and there.It just has bad contacts


 You would expect this kind of thing to just be trouble-free, it's a cord, what could be wrong with it but in this case you get what you pay for.

$review_text.: Works just as it should, however it could be better.My only criticism is the direction of the built in clip that allows you to clip it on pocket... it stands the brush side up which is uncovered, allowing a small amount of dust to collect on the bristles even when the brush is retracted.

$review_text.: There is a reason why Griffin continues to be one of the "brands" people trust for iPod and iPhone accessories. It's not only their designs, but they usually always put out a quality product that delivers. This charger is no different.While we all know the iPhone includes a charger, but who wants to have to use the sync cable for that all the time? I personally like having my sync cable near my computer, and prefer having a completely separate cable for charging. Just makes life a little more organized for me.The charger features a shiny, plastic design, a flip out prong design, and, of of course, includes it own sync cable. The charger also features an LED light to indicate when charging is complete (it will change from red to green).Wonderful product, probably not the greatest price, but well worth it considering the Griffin name.

$REVIEW.: So &#8230; you have 13 USB devices and you want them all plugged in at the same time. No worries. Sabrent has you covered with an inexpensive but quality USB hub. I have many Sabrent products at this point and they all offer a solid level of performance at a great price.I used my MacBook Pro for testing and everything worked fine. I was able to sync and charge my iPod, iPad, and iPhone. It also worked well for my external hard drives. Performance wise, I have no complaints.The USB cable that plugs into your computer is pretty short. Even if it was twice as long, I would still consider it short. Granted, you don&#8217;t want your cables to be longer than they need to be, but it would give you more placement options if there was more cable available. The AC adaptor&#8217;s cable was sufficiently long, however.The blue LEDs are pretty cool. They&#8217;re just there to look cool, but hey, mission accomplished! They do look cool.Overall, this is a well built hub with more ports than you&#8217;ll ever need. When you factor in the price, it&#8217;s a terrific deal.Disclosure: A unit was supplied to me for evaluation and review. This does not affect the veracity of my review.

$REVIEW.: The good thing is that it is cheap and the flashlight and channel display worked just fine. When tuning to the local weather radio, it worked just fine as long as I was outside, inside the house, reception was so bad that I could not use it. Our other weather radio with the same antenna length and at the same place worked just fine. It is made out of plastic so at least it cannot build up any rust....For a true emergency radio, I am expecting better receiption and the flashlight is so dim that my cellphone easily provides better light when the screen is set to a white color.This radio is probably better than nothing, but I am not really sure about that statement to be honest...

$review_text.: Years ago, I abandoned enclosures for the open-air architecture of an HDD dock

 I've purchased various docks as they've been released with chipsets that progressively supported larger  densities


 However, they were all not quite what I needed
 Until now.I've always actively cooled a docked drive by positioning a case fan behind the HDD


 This was always sort of a pain; I had to rig a 12V adapter, which made plugging/unplugging the fan fun, not to mention often knocking it over in the process (I had wire guards installed on both sides to prevent damage to the fan blades)


 It also took up some real estate on the desk
 But, I always found two constants: The larger the drive, the hotter it ran, and during large data transfers, having the fan running kept the drive much cooler.I had been using twoolderStartech docks for the past year


 One had arrived DOA, which Amazon promptly replaced, and both had worked flawlessly since


 But, there was still the fan annoyances


 Then, I saw that Startech had released this new model with an integrated fan
 YES!I have a LOT of external HDD's, and I manage a LOT of data, so I require multiple docks

 However, I only have one eSATA port in my HP DC7900


 So, I also bought aSyba SD-PEX-JM1A2E PCIe 1x PATA / 2x e-SATA Card
 Microsoft is not supporting USB3.0 until W8, and most of the reviews I've read on the 3.0 cards out there, the bottom-line performance doesn't really exceed eSATA, whose price point is still much lower than 3.0

 I also have an older Plextor 760A optical PATA optical drive, which is one of the best-performing read-error-correcting drives I've ever used, so the Syba's IDE connector was an added bonus (I replaced two cards in my machine with this one).The Syba card and Startech docks have turned out to be a killer combination
 As mentioned in reviews on the Syba, on sleep or shut down, it sends a command to the Startech's that power them down


 I also experienced a much faster data rate from the Plex thru the Syba than the previous IDE card I was using.The Startech docks's are awesome

 I can't rate the USB3.0 performance, but the eSATA transfer rate is plenty fast.There are manual eject buttons on the front; on the older Startech models, you had to yank the drive out of the connector while holding the dock down.That thumbwheel on the side is a fan speed controller
 Cranked to the max, the unit has a definite audible whine, and when two are running simultaneously, it's downright loud

 I backed the fan speed switch down halfway, which dropped the noise to just about nil, but holding my hand in front of the fan, I didn't feel much change in airflow
 I tried a few large backups at the slower speed, and the drives were just slightly more warm, but perfectly acceptable.And, if all that weren't enough, StarTech designed one more useful consideration: The rear housing of the fan is removable, so when the screen inevitably becomes blocked with dust, you can remove it and clean it with a can of compressed air
Too cool!All-in-all, me happy boy
 I can't recommend this dock (and the Syba card) more highly.

$REVIEW.: Picked up this Seagate Thunderbolt 1TB HD along with a Seagate 1 TB USB 3.0 hard drive.  Ran Blackmagic disk speed test and here are the results:ThunderBolt:  100MB/s+USB 3.0:  93MB/s+So if you are deciding between the Thunderbolt and the USB 3.0 version of the Seagate hard drive, go with the USB 3.0 version.  The speed difference is basically too small to justify the double (or more) in price.Why Choose the Thunderbolt Version?1.) If USB ports are a premium to you.2.) If you want to use another 2.5" SATA hard drive, such as a solid state hard drive (SSD).I tried the thunderbolt adapter with my Crucial M4 SSD 256GB and it worked just fine.  Got a write speed of nearly 190+MB/s and a read speed 360+MB/s.  Not bad for an old SSD, but nothing compared to the internal HD of the Retina MacBook Pro.  I also have plenty of other 2.5" HD that I've accumulated over the years and the thunderbolt adapter exposes a regular 2.5" SATA connector so they work just fine.  Just remember that a Mac can read PC HDs just fine (writing is a different story).Why Not Choose the Thunderbolt Version?1.) Price - it's double (or more) the price of the USB 3 version.2.) Hot, hot, hot!  The thunderbolt cable and adapter gets hot when in use.  A little too hot to actually hold, but not enough to burn you.  As a result the hard drive itself feels VERY warm to the touch (especially a SSD).  The USB 3 version is much cooler to the touch.3.) Bulkiness.  If you have a hard drive case you've used in the past to store your other 2.5" HDs they won't work.  The thunderbolt adapter sits at the bottom of the HD (like a base), so it's thicker than your average 2.5" HD.

The price is quite reasonable as compared to the same item made by other companies that are selling for 2-3 times as much.Note: I bought it from Amazon reseller 'Mac-Pro Online' and paid $7.15 plus basic shipping and it arrived literally the next day which was quite a nice surprise. With regards to functionality, it fits perfectly into the new iMac FW800 port and lets one continue to use their current FW400 devices. It does not look like it would be a problem for those who need to remove and reinsert it on a daily basis, but I have not had much experience with that side as of yet.I'd certainly recommend it and buy another myself if/when the time arises.

$REVIEW.: Look, these are JUST so cool. Seriously.Really very, very nice headphones. An excellent, superior product.If you're a weirdo-sound-geek or a headphone fetishist, these may or may not be for you. But if you like nice things and want insane headphones, read on.The look. The feel. These are as rich, as warm, and as nicely done as the interior of a Bentley. Rich wood, soft leather, beautifully designed, and have the heft of quality. Everything about them exudes luxury and function. They beg to be touched, to be put on. Anyone who has an issue with the design or materials of these headphones has got a screw loose - they are absolutely beautiful. And understated - these are for people who appreciate nice things without being flashy or showy. Old money, all the way. Wear these on an airplane and people will wonder why you're not in first class, assuming you're not.The sound. (This part is for normal people only. Geeks, weirdos and the anal retentive go-way - shoo!)The sound - these headphones are loud enough, offer excellent range at all volume levels, and as far as I can tell are more than suitable for hearing whatever it is you'd enjoy listening to. I listen to the Germs, the Eagles, Big Bands, Miles Davis, Mussorgsky, Beethoven, down tempo and everything in between. And they suit me fine. Are they mid-rangey? Sure, a little. If you want massive bass, buy some Beats. Are the highs too high? Nope. They are nicely balanced. Would an amplifier augment their performance? Always does.These are really good headphones. They are NOT studio headphones.Functionality. They are light and the action on the headpiece is good and solid. Not too tight (I wear a 7.5 hat.) They fold flat, which is nice. The chord could be heftier, but at $200 you get what you pay for.There are plastic components, sure. This is just the way it's done now. Are there headphones out there made of rare metals, carbon fibre, and the tender skins of fresh spring lambs for sheiks and the children of the idle rich to buy? Absolutely. But again, these are $200. Expect some lightweight materials or go get a better job. You.They come with a soft carrying case which seems fine as long as you are mindful. If you are careless or tend to sit on stuff without realizing it, then these will break just like everything else you've ever owned. Shame on you. Be more careful.If you want high quality, sensationally luxurious and convenient to carry headphones. Buy these. They will not disappoint. I've had them a few weeks and at least a dozen people have asked me about them. I tell them they can't have them, that they were a secret gift for insiders only.Hey, if everybody had them, we wouldn't be as cool as we are. Buy these.

$review_text.: Over the years I have had a variety of headphones in the $20 to $70 range - Panasonic, Sony, Koss, and some others.  These are far and away the best.  Songs that I have heard for years suddenly sound incredibly clear. It's as if I'm hearing the music for the first time.  Flamenco, bluegrass, opera, classical, rock, swing, jazz, blues, it all comes though incredibly clearly balanced.Pros:  the clarity and relatively light weight.Cons:  for some people it will be a tight fit if you have a large head like mine (7 1/2) which will grow tiring after an hour or so.  I mainly wear it at the gym to block out the sound of the machines and the horrible music they pipe in so after an hour or so I'm done.  If you like to wear it all day you should be aware of the possibly tight fit.  Also, they fit on top of my ears not around them which is not as comfortable as the $200 Bose I tried on that go around the ear.  I wear it around the house a little, but after an hour of music in my ear I need a break but that's not the headphones, it's me.  Also the cord is very long.  That can be good if you want to sit far from the TV or radio but for an MP3 player it is a bit inconvenient having a lot of cord wound up to keep it out of the way.
$SUMMARY.: Wow!  Best for the price!

$review_text.: This microSD card works very well with the cameras and camcorders I have, ranging from action cams to pro DSLR. Speed test shows 35 MB/s read and 25MB/s write average, and this is good enough for the most of the cameras. Only Sony&#8217;s AS100 action cam in certain setting (pro mode requires SDXC type. Regular HD shooting modes works fine with this card.) wouldn&#8217;t take this microSD along with other brands' cards that are SDHC. This card worked well and had no issues with my GoPros in all settings.This microSD card comes with a USB 3 adapter instead of SD sized adapter, and that can be beneficial for a certain situation. Most of the computers these days have SD card reader built in so it might have been better if the SD adapter was included which can be more useful when using in different cameras or equipments.Overall, this is a speedy microSD card that works great with most of the cameras. 32GB was enough for shooting raw files for a two day trip with a full frame body and never had any issues. When shooting and downloading files, I was confident that files were not corrupted on this card over three weeks of usage. If something goes wrong, this card has 1 year limited warranty and according to my past experience, I couldn&#8217;t complain about Lexar&#8217;s customer service. (I had one SD card replaced in the past due to the plastic wear and tear)The card worked well with other SD adapters and accessories (WiFi flash drive) along with the included USB 3 adapter.

$review_text.: I have nothing but superlatives for this tiny blaster, but I'll spare the superlatives in my review. I've lived with this little guy for over a month now and used it almost every single day. I've had the opportunity to compare it in side-by-sides with other external speakers and against the internal speakers of several devices. Hands down, the Simple Audio Go was the walkaway champion of every single comparison.My initial setup and bluetooth pairing with my Asus Nexus Pad took all of 15-30 seconds. It was almost completely user free. I turned on the devices pressed the scan/pair button and &#34;boom&#34; it locked, paired and started playing immediately. Clarity at high volume is crystal clear and I've had my wife come down from upstairs on multiple occasions to tell me to &#34;turn it down!&#34; Portability is spot on too, as it will easily fit in a shoulder bag or backpack. I keep the Audio Go paired to my Nexus pad, but have used the wired line connector for my SIII smartphone and my laptop. Oh, it charges really fast too and runs a long time on a charge... In fact, I haven't had it run out of a charge on me yet, but I've probably run it for no more than eight hours before recharging, so that may not be a great indicator of how long it will play before needing a recharge.All in all, I couldn't be happier with this little dynamo. Buy with confidence, you won't regret it!

$review_text.: I bought this at Target and after 60 days I tried to hook up my blu ray player via HDMI. It never would work and so I sent it back to Westinghouse and got a refurb in return with dead pixels and a scratched screen. I sent it back again and got another refurb in o.k. shape and it still has the same HDMI issue as others have mentioned on forums. You have to turn off your player and back on 4-5 times just to get a picture via the HDMI. Very dissatisfied with Westinghouse's poor customer service and products. I would give it 1/2 star if possible
$SUMMARY.: Bad HDMI

$review_text.: I purchased two of these headsets at once and when they arrived, one of the sets were damaged.  The opposing headpiece, the small rectangular piece that goes on the opposite side of your head, holding it on, it was broken off.  Amazon was very responsive and took care of the issue quickly.  In the meantime I used the other one and its great, clarity is good on both ends and works as advertised.  Despite arriving damaged, I still give the product a 5 star only because shipping mishaps cannot be controlled by the manufacturer and the product itself is sound!

$REVIEW.: I've been using this trackball for a about a day in SolidWorks.  Right now I plan to return it and try the Expert Trackball with the scroll ring.The good -It's a great trackball. Huge ball, programmable buttons, twist to scroll is an awesome feature for 99% of users.  If you like symmetric trackballs and don't have specific scrolling needs it's a good choice.The bad -For CAD users twist to scroll is not so good because it's almost impossible to twist without also moving the pointer a bit.  In CAD, scroll zooms and you spend a lot of time zooming in to pick some fine detail.  You want the pointer to stay put while you zoom in. This is a non-issue for scrolling documents etc.Other -This was the first time I tried using a symmetric 4 quadrant trackball like this.  I found the buttons were never in just the right place for me.  I would have to hold my hand in a semi-clenched position all day and this got tiring.  Other people rave about them so this my be a personal preference issue.Left-handed-pointing rant -I'm planning to get the Expert Trackball but I'm not optimistic about it either.  I like trackballs for a lot of reasons.  I need to mouse with my left hand because I already blew out my right shoulder with bad ergonomic habits.  The options for left-handers are extremely limited.  The symmetric layouts are ambidextrous but if you look at the snazzy right-hand-only trackballs from Logitech you know you're missing out.  I used to use the Logitech Marble Mouse before CAD software really tuned it's zooming around the scroll wheel.  I guess making a mirror image version is just too expensive to serve only ~20% of the population.

$review_text.: Several years back Neil Young release a song called "Piece of Crap".  He was singing about products like this player. I was a Samsung fan until I bought this player.  It is a piece of junk.  It is awful for Netflix streaming.  CDs always start a couple of seconds into the first track.  I frequently have to unplug this thing to get it out of "hung" mode.  I wish I had used it more when I first got it and I'd have discovered this and returned it.  Do NOT buy this player.  You'll be sorry.Sleeps With Angels

$REVIEW.: The cable was purchased for aCreative Labs Vado HD 4GB Pocket Video Camcorder 2nd Generation (Black Gloss) NEWEST MODEL. Having read the reviews I was leery of the cable quality. At the same time, for the price of the cable it was worth taking the chance.Cable arrived on time and works just fine on my 27" 720p HDTV; it is straight plug-and-play. Since some reviewers mentioned image quality (e.g. graininess), I compared the tv image to the image on my laptop and found them to be of equal quality adjusting for the size difference of the screens.

You can find probably some replacements but this one is original made by Olympus and I had another one for my other camera and this battery is very solid and of good quality. When I charged this one and keep  it in my back it was still fully charged after even few days of trip. My older battery didn't loose capacity after 3 years of using and still allowed me to take almost same amount of pictures as it was when battery was new. I recommend this battery as price is reasonable compare to quality.

$REVIEW.: I bought this because I don't like keeping up with the separate caps. I did expect the swivel cover to fit closer. With the big gap between the cover and the plug end, I feel like the plug is merely covered, not protected. Now that I'm getting a collection of these, for various uses, I'm considering getting a case for them; then loose caps and cover gaps won't matter.I also think the metal swivel is very unattractive from a design standpoint, but it's function that matters and I have no complaint there. The price is also fair, so I won't hesitate to buy more of these.

$review_text.: I bought my first Square Trade warranty in 2008 on a couple of Dell laptops I bought on ebay. Thought this was a good idea. It was, since one failed after just a year. That one was replaced, and in the meantime I had bought SQ Trade on every electronics item I had been purchasing, ranging from my PS3 to my Samsung LCD to my iPhone... you get the idea.I've had problems only with the laptop and repairs were attempted on it several times before it was replaced. It was always in and out of my door within a week's time. Every time I called I spoke to someone in Kentucky or California and they were terrific.My latest laptop has been having issues from day 1 which Dell attempted to fix 3 or 4 times. Square Trade fixed it once after the year Dell warranty was up, the second time they failed to repair it and I had to send it back. I just sent it out the fourth time, and now it takes two solid weeks for Sq Trade to do their stuff. Not only that, they are supposed to replace the item after 4 repairs; well, they discounted the time it had to be redone within two weeks because they don't want to pay anything towards replacing the thing. They're rewriting the rules folks, going the way of all good businesses in America.Today I called to ask where the heck my laptop is and the voice was not an American accent. I so depended on Square Trade to keep jobs in America and when they started up they promised that they would always be an American company.We've all been had, the service now sucks big time and you won't be dealing with a good ol' USofA company any more.Kudos on how to ruin a good thing.

$REVIEW.: This Sony Blu-ray system works great with my Sony Bravia HDTV with two exceptions.1. I can't make the TV sound (when watching regular TV) come out of the home theater system speakers.2. The TV volume button won't work any more.  I have to use the Blu-ray remote to control the TV volume.  This is bizarre.Other than these two annoyances, I'm really pleased with the system.  It's really nice to put in a disk and everything aligns properly to play a movie.The internet streaming works really good too.  We've watched several Netflix movies and had no problems at all.I read one negative review about this system not having built-in wireless capability and that didn't matter to me since I had planned to run an Ethernet cable to the unit when I installed it.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this PTID-8920B for my LANCER ES 2004 SEDAN in Black Friday and had it installed at the closest Auto shop.  It was replacing a Pioneer 15 UB. I already had a separate battery, the Shuriken bt-20, feeding two amplifiers: The Alpine MRP-300 4 ch and the BOSS PHANTOM PH 1502MW Mono. My amps driving a set of Infinity 2 ohm component speakers in the front doors and Sony Xplot 6 x 9 on the Rear deck. Also, pushing 2 Sony Xplod 10&#8221; subs in the trunk.So, with the 15-UB I had attained a really good quality from my music without using optional EQS or Crossovers. But I was dreaming about a DVD player with the optional Rear View Camera. So I decided this Power Acoustik PTID-8920B which I thought was good deal for the price, Bluetooth and all. I paired It with a generic Rear View camera that&#8217;s waterproof. After installation Observations: The touch screen has good response. It works fine with my fingers. The settings are easygoing. You can change the angle of the flip out monitor. Actually there was an incompatibility with the dash of my LANCER. When the monitor came out, it was getting obstructed by the upper part of the dash. So, hehheh. I guess this is a factor everytime when adding after market components. A little customization needed. So I dealt with that before the unit got broken ok!!!! Display settings enables you to go through 3 levels of brightness, useful for attaining less power consumption. DVD settings, the most useful stuff when watching DVDs. Now for the most important, the SOUND SETTINGS: Having changed from a Pioneer, these settings are poor. And that is to be expected for the price. You get preset EQ curves (Rock, Flat, etc.) Rock sounds better. You can tweak the EQ yourself, you get Bass, Treble, Fader, Balance, Loudness, and the Subwoofer output (Turn this on). The subwoofer output features 1 mono jack (Not L and R RCA&#8217;s, so you&#8217;ll need an optional Y adapter so you can connect RCA&#8217;s to the amplifier). Media playback: DVD/CD PLAYER &#8211; Overall good sound quality, tons of BASS Output. Nice Highs and Mids. USB Drive &#8211; Sound quality decreases. You get less bass output. Tons of Highs and Mids. You get better results when switching the EQ to Rock. AV-IN &#8211; Tons of Highs and Mids, but the Bass is far. Bluetooth &#8211; Tons of highs and Mids. Less Bass. But I should add that this feature is very convenient. You get to play music from your Tablet or Smartphone without cables. To this date I haven&#8217;t tried having a phone conversation using the Bluetooth feature. I focused on the sound quality. DVD MOVIES &#8211; I tried a couple DVDs. It&#8217;s working fine. Radio Tuner &#8211; Has some useful features. LOCAL, AS/PS. FM reception is working fine. Commentaries: The front panel as lots of buttons that are really small. I try to use the remote control always. The remote control has lots of buttons, so in order to use the unit it requires from you that you sit down and read. I don&#8217;t think somebody that comes to check your new car stereo for the first time would be able to understand it. It&#8217;s hard to read the small LCD screen. But who cares, it&#8217;s what you get for the price. Overall I believe I got a good deal. This unit packs good VALUE, and with a nice price. If you are an audio fanatic and you find the unit has too little features for tweaking your sound, all you have to do is to add an optional preamp EQ. I already did this.  Warning: When installing, be sure you get a &#8220;Good Ground&#8221;. I was getting noise through the speakers everytime I turned on the lights. Because the guys who installed the unit messed up with this. I added noise suppressor filters and it was fine but still I wasn&#8217;t completely satisfied.  Couple days later I found out that this was the cause of the problem. I corrected this myself.

$review_text.: This works as advertised, as long as both of my HDMI components were turned on.  When one of my components turned off (and I have one component that turns itself off automatically if not being used), the switch fails and the screen goes dark.  I sent a question to IOGEAR on this, and the solution was to add the power supply.  When one of the connected HDMI lines loses power, I believe that the voltage drops low enough to turn off the switch.  Adding the external power supply fixed the problem.  I am rating it excellent here because the customer service at IOGEAR was awesome!  In a time when customer service has gone downhill in many electronics areas, these guys were helpful, fast, and excellent!  The switch (with added power supply) is exactly what I needed to switch between my BlueRay player and my cable box.

$REVIEW.: Was going back and forth about buying a Apple Battery. The reviews of Techno Replacement Battery seemed to be good. So I decided to give it a go.The battery fits and works just fine. Just took the battery out of the packaging and put it right into the computer. Hit the on button and my computer started right up. Great!  The battery came with a 65% charge. Great again.My only complaints...Mind you, I am really nit picking..These small faults are not worth buying the Apple vs the Techo battery. But some Mac/Apple purest might not like these small differences.The color of the battery is slightly off. Not sure if my bottom of Mac Book has changed color and the white on the Techno is just a slightly different color.  The Lights on the bottom of the battery which show the battery charge are white on the Techno Battery and  Green on the orignal Apple Battery. Both light up brightly, but the Techno led lights have a slight bleed though the white plastic. While on the Apple, the green led lights are clean and crisp.The rubber foot is not the same as the other feet on my Mac. The foot on the Techno is white and on the Apple Mac Book are a grey color.Mind you, These are on the BOTTOM of my computer where no one can see them and I saved a lot of money.And YES, I would buy this battery again.

$review_text.: OK - by now you probably read all the reviews from 1-Star (freezing software, way too expensive) to all the 5-Star ravings.What I would like to add are the following points :Yes - the iPod froze on me as well when I left it connected to my Mac and the computer fell into 'sleep' mode over night. This caused my iPod to completely drain the battery and for some reason, I had to restore the software on the little device. But this was so simple, following the instructions, that it did not have any effect on my enthusiasm regarding this device.Because, with the 40 Gb hard disk, you REALLY can take all the music that matters to you with you. I have over 4000 Records and CDs and while the 'ripping' takes some time, it is unbelievable how convenient it is, to have every song I like at the tip of my fingers. I used to burn 'compilation CDs' but with the limit of 80 minutes, there were always songs that were left out. I no longer have this problem since I am now able to make any compilation of any length thanks to the 'playlist' feature. Think about it - make your 'Best of the Beatles' or 'Best of Britney' (depending how old you are) without having to decide, what song to drop from your compilation CD. But the most fun is to simply let the iPod shuffle through the thousands of songs. It's a great opportunity to hear 'long forgotten' tracks from my 'back catalogue'. In combination with the Mac Music Store, I am no longer spending hours at CD stores. While it is sad, that CDs are slowly going the way the records went, gadgets like the iPod sure add a new exciting way to enjoying your music. And to everyone who thinks, mp3 files don't sound as good as 'the real thing', I say : Think again ! Especially the AAC format sounds amazing !
$review_summary.: So much more than just a portable music player !

$review_text.: Getting them in sync with the 3-D Sharp TV wasn't quite as easy as some suggest - at least not for me.  It took a few attempts to finally get them turned on and then to stay on.  The combination of instructions for the glasses and the compatible Sharp TV's are weak and not very helpful.  Once I did get everything working I found the 3-D to be every bit as distracting as it was when I was 10 years old.  I guess it's a matter of taste,  3-D to me is just a gimmick - and an irritating one at that.

$REVIEW.: While I"m sure in a year the kinks will be worked out, this product isn't ready for mainstream deployment.  After plugging it into my 2012 MacBook Air, it froze the entire machine.  In comparing the USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt adapters to the GoFlex 1.5TB 2.5inch portable drive, the USB 3.0 was actually faster running BlackMagicDesign Disk Speed Test.Other things to consider (beside the high price of the adaptor and cable) ... the Thunderbolt adapter nearly doubles the thickness of the drive since unlike the USB 3.0 adaptor, it has a 3x5 by 1/2 inch portion attached to the back of the drive.  It also runs hot and transfers the heat to the drive.  The Apple cable, which actually has logic chips in it, runs very very hot (the cable).-- Mark

$review_text.: It's a little hard to believe I've tried this many of these devices... 6 different tablets including an ipad(first one) and three android phones. This archos 8" is pretty sweet so far. I bought this for my 17 y/o daughter. It is responsive, light and comfortable to handle. Makes a great reader, photo viewer, music player, netflix streamer... the wireless works well and she uses it for facebook, streaming and browsing. Bluetooth is handy especially for music playback... it has a micro sd card slot, thought we would miss having a host usb port, not an issue. Battery is good considering she makes no effort to extend use by turning off radios she's not using, so she gets 7 to 10hrs of mixed use. I have been using a toshiba thrive myself and have considered selling it to get an Archos 80.

If you have owned other cases for the playbook you know most wont close or stand up with the charger plugged in. With this case if you use the quick charger you can close it, and stand it up without the charger getting the way.  This is why i choose this case over the others.  Granted you have to buy the quick charger from blackberry to take advantage of these benifits but it's worth it.

 When connected to your phone with a mini-hdmi cable, you can display photos from your phone on the TV
 If you want to watch video from your phone, you will need to download an app in order to do so

$review_text.: I REALLY like this player.  It has all the features I wanted in a cheaper portable player but it does eat batteries. However, I found that the 1.6 volt NiZn batteries do VERY well in this unit. I noticed the bad reviews of some who said that it has a problem with the anti-skip. I too had that problem until I switched to these NiZn batteries.  It seems this unit needs a lot of power to run properly and when I was just using alkaline batteries, it would skip/shut off with any jolt after just about an hour or two of runtime.  But when I switched to these NiZn, it played great for several hours. I am returning my first unit due to a bad headphone jack that cuts the right channel when the headphones are plugged all the way in. I'm ordering another player in hopes that the jack will be fine and everything will work well.

$REVIEW.: Very nice hard drive if you want to transfer between PC and Mac.The drive comes preformatted for Mac and you need to go to the web per the optional instructions to install the driver to make it work with a PC - it worked fine on my Windows 8 machine. Not sure why it can't be pre-installed on the hard drive - 'Dashboard' software was on the drive already. Simple and painless install. And the Dashboard software can be deleted easily.The 500GB external hard drive is a 7mm thin form factor and is a good solution for transferring large files. I don't have USB 3.0 so couldn't test out that feature cross-platform. Also didn't try the Time Machine aspect.The hardware is a soft-touch bottom with an aluminum/metal top - not sure if that's the most durable and how hot it may get over time. Also, the light on the device is a on/off, not an access blinking type.The packaging is also super small and the USB cable feels more premium than other devices.One silly thing - there is a picture of an iPhone on the packaging - desperate attempt to tie in to a brand without any direct relevance. Some references even in the product literature as well.

The only complaint that I have is that it doesn't support the head unit well enough just by bending the tabs on the radio up.  I had to put a piece of foam in between the empty tray and the radio for added support.  No big deal though.  If you buy this you'll see what I mean.

$review_text.: I love this case.  It's beautiful and made of soft, durable pebble leather so it will last.  I love how it fits perfectly. It has a nice feel to the pebble leather and it's color is so pretty.  The back has an awesome flap so it stands up easily and the inside is velvet soft.  So much better than the cheaper made cases.  I chose the pink one hoping the men in my life would not want to use it, no such luck.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the charger is blocked when the case is closed, so its unprotected when it's charging.  That's the only thing I would change about this case.  I just keep it tucked away while charging for protection.

$review_text.: This is a nice budget case with the essentials of good functionality and design.As for the reviewer who says it's cheap metal, well, it is a budget case... I think the metal is good for the price, but if you want a better case, then you'll need to pay more. I paid about $40 shipped and think it's a good deal at the price.Negatives:* One issue I had though was trying to get one of the sides closed - the side behind the motherboard - because I had routed the motherboard power cable behind it for cable management and it was wrapped so it was a little thick and there wasn't much space. I imaging if the power cables weren't wrapped then the cable could be more easily smashed flat and the side closed.* Seems to be a fingerprint/body oil magnetPositives:* Looks nice* One USB 3.0 port* Relatively light-weight* Great airflow - includes 2 fans that are reasonably quiet with options for at least 2 moreOther:* Because this is a mini-tower, I highly recommend a module power supply so you don't have to keep unneeded power cables in the case - here is a good one:Corsair CX Series 430 Watt ATX/EPS Modular 80 PLUS Bronze ATX12V/EPS12V 384 Power Supply CX430M* I'm using it with this motherboard:MSI LGA1155/Intel B75/DDR3/SATA3 and USB 3.0/A and GbE/MicroATX Motherboard B75MA-E33If you want higher quality materials, like thicker steel and less plastic, then pay more and get a better case but if you want a functional, good-looking, budget case then this is a good case for the money, especially if you can get it for $40 shipped (or less).Overall 4.5 stars for the price so I'm rounding up to 5.

$review_text.: I'm a bit of a networking guru (as deemed by friends, family, and coworkers) and in my tenure, I've had significant hands-on experience with just about every kind of home/small office networking kit including wireless routers, network switches, wireless Ethernet bridges, specialized antennas, etc. I'm relatively new to networking over power lines, but I do have prior experience with an older 85Mbps Linksys system. After using the NETGEAR Powerline AV200, my opinion remains the same: I'm sold on the concept of Homeplug's power line networking solution since it is a fantastic way to expand the reach of an existing network, but your mileage will depend on the quality of internal wiring. (Giving credit where credit is due: Homeplug's technology powers most of the power line networking devices such as my older Linksys system and NETGEAR's AV200.)Setting up a new power line network is extremely simple... just plug one of the AV200's into the wall with its Ethernet cable into your router/switch, and plug the other module anywhere you'd like to add an Ethernet connection. The beauty of Ethernet is that you can either directly connect the AV200 to a single device, or you can hook it up to a multi-port switch so multiple devices can be served by a single AV200. It should be noted that there's nothing stopping you from plugging in a second wireless router set to AP mode into the AV200 and effectively expanding your existing wireless coverage.Since the AV200 (and all power line networking units) use your existing electrical wiring as the physical transmit medium, there are inherent advantages and disadvantages compared to traditional wireless internet. One advantage is relative immunity to common sources of radio interference, so Bluetooth, microwave ovens, and other devices that potentially wreak havoc on 2.4GHz 802.11B/G/N networks won't cause your connection to spontaneously drop. Another advantage is wiring simplicity-you don't need to make dedicated Ethernet cable runs and chances are the device you're trying to network is already connected to the AC wiring.One of the disadvantages is that power lines were not designed to carry data and the overall topology can vary wildly, so this is really a case of "your mileage will vary." For example, it's entirely possible that different outlets will work better than others since sources of interference on your power lines are relatively localized. Also, since the network medium is power lines, the maximum range of your network is a little fuzzy and can extend beyond the boundaries of your residence or office. Although the signal will degrade over distance, a shared common element such as a transformer can propagate the signal, theoretically putting your network in range of multiple residences. You can mitigate this issue, in part at least, by turning on the security/encryption function which is thankfully very easy to use, but I suspect many users will not.Overall, I think that the NETGEAR Powerline AV200 is a fine product that's powerful and easy to use. From my experience, it's much easier to use this device to extend my network versus wireless Ethernet bridges or repeaters and it's more reliable to boot. I am disappointed, however, that the AV200 doesn't have a built-in 4-port switch like as my old Linksys kit, considering the AV200 costs significantly more. In the end, I am very satisfied with the AV200 and am happy to conclude that power line networking is ready for the prime time.Below, I've come up with a list of my Power Line Networking Best Practices1) Things with big motors such as blenders, fans, vacuums, etc. are notorious for generating electrical noise and this can impact performance.2) Some surge protectors / UPS units will block the signal that the AV200 needs to operate. For best performance, plug the unit into the wall.3) Circuit breakers and fuse boxes will degrade the signal, but it's entirely possible to use Homeplug devices that are on different electrical circuits eg. upstairs/downstairs.4) The 200Mbps AV200's didn't work with my 85 Mbps Linksys.

$review_text.: The first thing you need to know about this Mounting Kit is that it arrived broken. All the pieces are loose in a bag and it was shipped with the stereo I bought and wiring harness. The piece that broke was on the left side of the mounting kit, right above the pocket. The plastic is very thin there. It must have broken during shipping. The Mounting Kit was so cheap that I didn't want to send it back, so I repaired it myself. I assembled the kit for my application and plastic welded all the pieces together. It seem very strong now. Possibly stronger than it's original design.Aside from the frustration of repairing the bracket, this is a great mounting kit. I love the look of it. Some other mounting kits look out of place when installed. This looks very close to factor in my 2002 E-350 Super Duty. The pocket is a nice addition, but I hope it doesn't end up being filled with junk.A couple of recommendations, 1) Use the included ISO Trim Ring. It completes the overall look of the mounting kit. 2) Don't try to use the mounting equipment that came with your Stereo. Screw the Stereo directly to this Mounting Kit.It's a shame that the manufacture doesn't make this unit anymore. It is by far the best looking, and easiest Mounting Kit I've ever used.

$review_text.: I ordered this as a backup charger after I spent hours one day looking for the the original because I thought the price was too good not to. I've only used it a few times so far to charge a NP-FM55H battery - I found the original before this replacement arrived - and I've had no issues with yet. I'm keeping it in our big car together with a backup battery and a Compact Flash memory card as an 'emergency kit', just in case the original battery runs out of juice or the card in the camera runs out of space when we really, really want to take some pictures.The following are worth knowing about this charger - features different from our original Sony charger:- low price- smaller than the Sony charger- plugs directly into the wall outlet (no cord needed)- comes with a cigarette lighter adapter (great to have this on the road)To conclude: great for a backup or if the original charger gets lost.

$REVIEW.: I really like this laptop. I know some people are skeptical of Amazon Vine reviews, but if you look at my other reviews you will see I don't give 5 star often. I think HP has created a fantastic laptop to compete against the Apple products. Even my kids who are diehard Apple fans are drooling over this sleek, lightweight, fast laptop.I have had several HP products in the past, also Dell and my most recent purchase of a Lenovo laptop.  The last HP computer I had was a desktop I purchased in 2008 and I swore that I would never own another HP product because of the bad experience with that machine. But, when I was presented with this offer I decided to give it a try and HP has hooked me back in. I've always loved HP's setup of a new computer, they make it effortless. Unlike th Lenovo I recently purchased that left me scratching my head on whether or not it was setup completely. HP walks you through step by step right through the initial setup and registration.The laptop is lightweight and thin! The one negative for me is that it does not come with a DVD drive, but I was able to purchase an external DVD drive to go along with it so not too big a deal, but I do miss the internal drive.I love the look of this with it's sleek aluminum finish to the underside red rubberish material. Nice big, bright screen and a keyboard that lights up if you need it.The laptop runs quick, is quiet, and so far has been working like a dream. I've loaded Microsoft Office on to it along with Quicken and a few other programs and all running flawless. I'm real happy with this and know that it will give me several years of use.  I also look forward to being able to travel with it and easily slip it into any bag.Nice job HP!

$REVIEW.: I am a Pentax fan, currently own a K-5 IIs but have also owned a K-5, K-7 and a K-X with several prime LTD lenses, so it was relatively easy for me to decide what P&S; camera to buy. The original price tag of $499 was way to high for me to justify a purchase but when I saw it for $252 (prime) I grabbed it. The reason for the MX-1 is their have far to many times I wished I had a camera with me but lugging a DSLR plus lenses was a bit too much especially since I'm in my 60's. Besides who actually carries this kind of gear when you're just going to the store? Also I wanted this when scouting. A small camera is far to convenient and the MX-1 produces some very fine images. Keep in mind it is a small sensor and if you print you may be able to get a decent 8X10 but don't push it. If you upload to a site such as FLICKR this will be more than adequate.  The menus are very similar to other Pentax cameras though very limited but very useful. As for the build, very solid. Not your atypical plastic fantastic. Heavier than most but at about 13 oz but it won't wear you down. Not a truly pocket-able camera so a case is required unless you have very large poctets. Fits well inside my parka but would probably be a problem in cargo pants or shorts. Viewing in the sun even with the LCD brightness set to max is better than most but carry a loupe or shade it. In low light, turn it down a bit. At normal setting it's very bright. Battery life seems to be fairly decent considering the LCD is used for focusing and setting exposure. I suppose it could be better if you choose to use Auto Pict or scene modes which is ok since it is a P&S; but if you a new to this use the Av, Tv or M settings to learn what they do. Perhaps you may want to upgrade eventually. Plenty of stuff online to help with this. I've only taken about 100 pics with this after having it for three days and I am very pleased with the results. Regardless buy a spare battery or two. The Wasabi batteries from Blue Nook (seller) are excellent a far less expensive than the Pentax version.  At this price I highly recommend it as long as you don't mind not having a view finder and hot shoe, the latter over rated, in my opinion, for small camera besides you can always trigger an off camera flash. The flash does have red eye reduction, slow speed sync, slow speed sync with red eye as well as trailing  curtain sync. All very useful. There is also an auto mode plus flash on and off. Be prepared to use to use the exposure compensation dial, the flash is rated at GN 13? I read somewhere, it's not in the manual, but with a small sensor it has a tendency to over expose when using it manually, on auto it seems to worked fairly well.As with all cameras this one has it's own short comings, as I have mentioned, but at the current price point it's a great buy. The quality of the RAW images are really excellent for a small sensor plus a fast telephoto lens that is very sharp corner to corner with no vignetting, at least none that I have noticed, CA's are also well controlled.
$review_summary.: Solid camera

$review_text.: I read some of the other reviews and I agree that the case may sometimes put pressure on the buttons, but I did TWO things to avoid this:1) Press the buttons on the case BEFORE you put it on to loosen them up a little, so basically pop in and pop out a couple of times to loosen it up.2) Once I put the cover on I noticed that it is a very tight fit, which is GOOD but you have to pull a little to "stretch" the case until the buttons line up perfectly.I think others have had problems with the buttons and speakers because they do not realize that you have to put the case on and then "tug" a little to make sure the edges are properly gripped and that everything aligns perfectly, because it will contract once it is on and create a tight fit, which is GOOD!!! I LOVE THIS CASE and everything lined up perfectly form the audio port, power button, speaker outlets, everything so I am extremely happy I pre-ordered this and stayed away from the Leather and Silicone cases because this is clear and you can see my beautiful WHITE touchpad as if it did not have anything on it.Some of the pictures on here give the plastic a slight pink hue but at least with my WHITE touchpad you do not even see the TPU case from a distance and I am glad that they chose to keep the TPU case along the edges and not wrapping into the black frame along the sides. You will NOT be disappointed and the ONLY thing this case is missing is some form of "peg leg" so you can stand it or prop it up but I will just get one of the stands they sell on here... :)Finally, the Touchstone Dock still works with this case on the Touchpad... Schweet!!!

$REVIEW.: Not sure what happened, but for some reason I received a 2tb buffalo drivestation to review as opposed to the smaller more portable ministation.  I debated about whether to write this review or not, but thought I would go ahead since problem may be indicative of an inventory issue.That being said - the drive I did receive is working just fine, I have it hooked up to my router and my wireless cameras use it to record video to it via ftp and they have been doing so fine for almost a month with no issues.  I had kind of wanted the smaller usb powered ministation just for portability and was a little disappointed to receive the large drivestation. However, after reading other peoples reviews detailing problems with the ministation, maybe I was actually fortunate to get the wrong one.Some thoughts I will offer up on the ministation - since it is usb powered and doesn't have a separate power cord, you cannot plug it into an unpowered usb hub and expect it to work.  And in some cases it will not work plugged into front usb ports of a desktop.  A lot of times, those usb ports do not provide enough power thru them to power a portable hard drive.Also, with any of these usb hard drives, you must make sure that you eject it before just unplugging it or you will risk losing data - if you just unplug it from the computer without ejecting then windows doesn't have enough time to finish writing to it and data corruption occurs.Also, if you are running windows 8 and click on the provided link to download software, it will only show the manuals not the software - I guess their software has not yet been updated to support windows 8.

$REVIEW.: I bought one of these little bad boys as a cheaper alternative to the iPod Shuffles that everyone likes to get. In my opinion, this is better than the iPod Shuffle. For one, it has a screen and a menu to easily navigate through the songs. Secondly, it's way cheaper than the iPod Shuffle and honestly has the same sound quality, maybe even a little better depending on your headphones. It has a handy little clip to use during a workout and always stay in place. It's the perfect size and weight for running or doing any kind of intense cardio. This is perfect for the gym and I can't speak highly enough about it!**Edit 6/9/2013**The MP3 Player itself still works great. The only problem I have run into is that I can't plug the mini USB in all the way anymore or else it won't charge. I found that if I only plug it in half way it seems to work fine. Just a heads up in case anyone else runs into this issue.

$REVIEW.: Summary: mediocre microphone, comfortable for all-day wear, suggest rechargeable batteries for daily use.I use these in the office mostly and for occasional travel. The noise cancellation is really great while traveling, but get a headset with a more directional mic if you plan on using it for phone / Skype calls. Unfortunately the mic hangs facing away from your mouth, picking up other people and room noise. My office is not extraordinarily loud, but in order to use this as a headset, I must hold the mic directly in front of my mouth with one hand and have the other hand ready with the mouse to mute/unmute the mic.I recommend rechargeable AAA batteries. I go through about 1-2 every weeks, depending on how much I use them for music. The 35-hour estimated battery life seems accurate.

$REVIEW.: I can't say enough good things about this camera.  I decided to treat myself to this all-in-one camera after years of using separate photo and video cameras.  I'm just your average person that likes to take pictures and movies of family and other interests.  This camera makes it so easy, fun and beautiful.  I get compliments on my photos and videos all the time.  I usually use the auto settings.  I have tried some of the special settings, but I haven't scratched the surface.Sure, this camera is larger than some out there, but it packs a lot into a camera of a easily managed size. It is responsive, easy to use and gets you results you'll be proud to share with others.  I don't see how any amateur photographer could go wrong with this camera.

$REVIEW.: I needed to replace a single camera/VCR based system and did a LOT of comparison shopping before deciding on the 21031 Defender.  It sounded like it had amazing capabilities and was a phenomenal value.  After installing and using it, I can say that I am a little disappointed, but still think it has great potential once all of the petty issues are resolved.  I just wish I knew the info below before I installed the system so I could have set it up differently!PROS:The price was great (manufacturer's website sale), the packaging was compact and protective, the installation wasn't very difficult (except for fitting my stout frame through the attic above my vaulted ceilings), the wires were more than long enough to reach all corners of my 1900 sq ft ranch home with 10'+ to spare (located DVR on a high shelf in centralized laundry room), basic system setup was fairly intuitive except for a couple of things listed below (I haven't networked it yet).  My cameras actually seem to get a better picture at night than during the day.  I can clearly see my trailers parked over 85' away in total darkness.  Bear in mind, I couldn't tell you if a small child or raccoon was sitting on top of the trailer, but I can tell the trailers haven't been moved!  Playback was not as disappointing as expected (see below) and mobile viewing was simple.  See instructions below for simplified networking setup and DDNS (for those with dynamic IPs).  The Defender manual has outdated instructions and will not work!CONS:Attachment hardware is cheap junk (used my own stainless screws, not a big deal), two of the vertical adjustment screws on the cameras arrived stripped out and could not be tightened (the aluminum casting it threads into was so soft and thin that I could not re-thread it larger, I used a fan balancing clip to space one sun shade off of the soffit and it works perfectly fine, the other required a piece of 12ga copper wire for a brace and a few wraps of electrical tape and it works fine as well, just an annoyance), one setup oddity - the motion sensing area selection is the opposite of what you would expect - the red shaded areas are not blocked, they are the areas monitored - it took me a few days to figure out why my motion detection wouldn't turn off, I had it set up backwards), and now for the BIG KAHUNA - BEWARE even though this system has great cameras it CANNOT RECORD anywhere CLOSE to the definition it is capable of displaying!  The DVR's total Frame rate of record is limited to 428 (ish) and a single HD1 feed is 178!  The best D1 (dvd quality) feed cannot even be recorded on a single channel at full quality!  In order to setup to record 7 of the 8 channels on my system, I had to turn down all of the frame rates to the 9-13 range and dial back the resolution on the cameras I thought would have lower potential of recording any crime.  This REALLY made me mad, but I had already gone to the effort of installation and put holes in my soffits and ceilings and didn't want to tear it all back out!  Networking was a bit tedious (see below).Update, 12-30-12:  Two of the cameras work fine during the day, but stopped showing a picture at night (even though the IR-LEDs are working and you can hear the mechanical filter/focus function inside of the camera when you shine a light in it at night).  Defender's online tech support suspected bad cables and had me uninstall and swap a good cam w/ a bad cam and reboot the system and magically they all started working.  Weird, right?NETWORKING, PLAYBACK, & MOBILE VIEWING:Setting the DVR up for remote viewing is not really difficult but the instructions in the manual are not entirely correct.  Start following the supplied directions, but use method 1 AND method 2 (pg 51-52) to prep your computer for viewing.  IGNORE the instructions for port forwarding (pg 54-56) and instead, do this: go to the defender-usa website, click on the support link and then on the networking tab.  Using the 1step program, open the instructions and download the program, but SAVE it and open it manually because it is a zipped file and will not just run.  Follow the directions supplied, but when it auto detects the ports to forward do NOT use the auto-filled numbers, they are likely wrong.  Use the numbers you wrote down from the step on pg 51 (my ports were 09000, 00080, and 18004).  Fill in the correct port numbers and continue following their directions.  When you finish with port forwarding, have verified your sucess via the website, and found your external IP, go back and add the external IP to the trusted sites using method 2 (pg52).  Everything else worked as they said it would.  It takes maybe 30 minutes to set up.  As for playback, the computer-based playback is MUCH easier to search and use than the dvr&mouse; based version.  Playback video quality was satisfactory  (not nearly as poor as I had expected when I discovered the underwhelming recording capabilities of the DVR described above).  It was incredibly simple to set up for mobile viewing (make sure you did the port forwarding for 18004 previously), download the app (Asee), insert your information, and it works fine (live view only, no playback functionality).  I used WindowsPhone (which they said was not supported) and it works just fine!Update, 1-21-13:  Support is only available during standard business hours EST so it can be difficult to get help, but when contacted they were somewhat informative and somewhat helpful (at least are easy to reach and they TRY to help...)  They were able to fix my camera problem from above, they just can't tell me what caused it.  Also, my remote viewing stopped working a couple of days after I set it up.  It wound up my IP address was wrong.  Well, not really wrong, just different.  I learned that my ISP uses dynamic IP addressing (they randomly change it) and that I could either pay extra to get a static IP or setup DDNS.  I setup an account with Defender's 1-Step networking software's recommendation (no-ip.org) but Defender could not help me get the DVR setup because the firmware would ONLY allow DynDNS as the server and they have ceased offering service.  My case was forwarded to the R&D; department and I heard nothing by 1-29-13 when I got mad and started digging around the web for a solution(see below).HOW TO SETUP YOUR DDNSUpdate, 1-29-13:  After some Google research I figured out this procedure to setup your DDNS host with dyndns.org (which 'doesn't do' free service anymore).  Don't ask why it works because I don't know!  Go to dlinkddns(com) and sign up for an account, go ahead and create a host (it won't matter what it is).  After you have your account activated, go to dyndns(org) and sign in using your dlink account.  Set up a new host with a dyndns name (I used mynewhostname.dyndns.org).  On the DVR, go to the network menu, ddns tab, enable ddns, select dyndns as your server, enter your new dyndns hostname, enter your dlink username and password, click test to verify, click apply, and exit.  You should now be hooked up to the 'nonexistent' free dyndns service!  BTW - I don't hate this system yet, I still think it has lots of potential, it's just not very user friendly!Extra note about networking for remote view - if you lose power or have to reboot your router, you must then reboot your DVR (with the network connection on and plugged in) or it will not recognize the network connection.  This means your dynamic IP has changed and you must re-run the 1Step networking program to reset your port forwarding.  You also must do this each time your dynamic IP changes (even if you did not power-cycle your router).  I'm buying a UPS to prevent this problem.After two weeks R&D; finally got back to me (2-5-13) and said that the DVR could not update the dynamic IP address with no-ip.org's server and I would have to download, install, and leave the software from no-ip.org running (nonstop) on a computer attached to the DVR's router to update it.  (REALLY? I figured that out the first time I tried to set it up, but since I installed the system to stand alone, I have no access/space to leave a running computer attached to the DVR's router!)  Useless toolbags... now I'm beginning to hate Defender.  Although, the system does seem to have stabilized; no ip change and full functionality has been maintained for one month straight... we'll see how long it lasts!

$REVIEW.: I just got a new tripod & ball head and thought I needed a level on the camera. This works fine, but after trying it I will end up getting the big green cube hotshoe mount type because when the camera is on the tripod and the view finder is at eye level I can't stand tall enough to look down onto this level. The cube type is visible even if you're below eye level with the view finder (like if you're using live view with the camera raised high to get over an audience's heads).If I lost this and had a use for one, this unit seems fine. But, as I'm learning what actually works when taking pictures, this doesn't provide me the functionality I need.

$REVIEW.: I tried out this one (WR-333) and another model (the WR-111B) and both are good, basic emergency radios.  The only technical difference I noticed is that the 333 has room for AAA batteries as an alternate power source.  This is probably unnecessary most of the time but if you're worried about the rechargeable battery for some reason you can have a backup this way.  The 333 is also bigger and has a clip on the top for hanging it up whereas the 111B has a lanyard.Both feature a small solar panel on the top to help keep the battery charged (I leave it sitting on a window sill) but there's also a hand crank.  There's a flashlight (triple LED), an AM/FM radio that can also pick up emergency weather frequencies (e.g. 162.550 MHz).  If you leave it plugged in, it can be set to automatically turn on when there's a weather alert (it says you can do this without plugging it in but it drains the battery fast).It also features an ability to plug in a cell phone.  Note that the battery on these things is fairly small -- your smart phone holds more of a charge -- so it's not going to fill up your phone.  What it CAN do, though, is give your phone enough juice to run for a few minutes which might be enough to help you out in an emergency (I imagine if you were dedicated enough you could charge your phone, crank the battery back up and then charge your phone again if you wanted more juice right away).The speaker is about what you'd expect from these radios -- weak and tinny.  But there's a stereo out jack and it sounds fine through my earphones.
$SUMMARY.: Nice rechargeable radio with some bonus features

$REVIEW.: I got the black one. Despite of all the good reviews here, the fit isn't snug at all. There are slacks all around. A lot of times the case's edge just slips out of position as I grab my iPad up. The alignments between buttons/switches and the openings are a bit off too. My screen rotation lock switch becomes hard to reach in it. Overall, the case is not recommended. However the screen protector is not bad.

$review_text.: The card works great in my new 10 MP Pentax A30 camera. I did have some difficulty getting the reader, that comes with the card, to connect properly to my Windows XP Pro computer. This card can not be read in a standard SD card reader. You have to use the included reader or an SDHC reader. It took about half hour to get this reader working, but now that it is installed and working on my computer, it works consistently and well. (by installed I mean, my computer found and properly self installed what ever it needed to make this an active device. I had to reboot several times and it was really a pain. I wound up buying a new media reader that included the new sdhc format).Some of the issues I've run into are: 1. if I'm at a party and take photos and I want to share them with friends, they can't read this card in their standard card reader. So I have to carry card reader with me all the time. 2. Since it was so hard for me to install, it worries me connecting to the computers of others. 3. I lost all other USB and firewire external devices trying to get this reader to work. I've had to unplug the reader and reboot the computer to get the original devices working again, it's embarrassing and 4. I'm concerned about messing up other peoples computers.So until SDHC card readers become more popular, I've gone back to using my standard 2GB SD card, and carrying the new 4GB SDHC card as a back up.

$review_text.: I got one of these at Goodwill for $3.00!  There was no problem pairing the Bluetooth and it seems to have long range and will work across the room, unlike other Microsoft wireless keyboards that only have a range of about 1 foot! I guess the extended range is due to the Bluetooth.  It works good on my Android Mini PC except for moving the mouse pointer.  The odd thing is it has hand holds on each side to hold it with but moving it around in the air doesn't do anything. I guess it don't have a gyro or accelerometer like other wireless Bluetooth keyboards do.  There are left and right mouse buttons on the left side but no joy stick or touch pad to move the mouse with!  It has a square pad on the right called the Navigation Pad with up, down. left and right buttons but they don't do much. You'd think it would have a good way to move the mouse, a nipple in the middle of the keyboard like Thinkpads have at least!

$review_text.: I ordered a Sony HDR-SR11 Handycam, with hopes of using an older case I had laying around...but after I got the camcorder I thought it was way to nice to be stuck with a used camera bag.I came to Amazon and found this kit with an extended battery and nice case!  For cheaper than the battery alone!!!1) The battery included with the HDR-SR11 is pretty decent, and I got through a pretty crazy family Christmas with it.2) With that said the included NPFH70 that comes with this kit is at least double the life (in my usage at least) It almost seemed like it wouldn't die!3) The case is very spacious, but I didn't find it to big for my HDR, its got a nice Velcro padded divider that makes a nice lone compartment for your camcorder, no matter what model
 This leaving me a spot for a cleaning cloth, and lens cleaner, in the same main compartment.4) Pockets, Pockets, Pockets!  When I got my camcorder I didn't own any accessories, except the included remote which fits nicely in the top cover zippered mesh pocket


 The case has a zippered pouch on both ends of the case (to the left and right of the front "Sony" lettering) both a perfect size for my spare battery and recently purchased 3 watt light

 There is also a pocket on the front of the case (below the "Sony" lettering to the front of the case) that's pretty large, and personally I use it for spare DVD-R's, and a HDMI to mini HDMI cable.This case is very well built, and extremely sturdy, the textile nylon exterior is really durable, and doesn't soak up water easily (NOT WATERPROOF BY ANY MEANS JUST LIGHT RAIN AND SNOW) the bottom is solid and has nice hard rubber/plastic feet to keep the case up off the surface its placed on.I'm really happy with this case, perfect match for my new camcorder...I highly recommend it.

$REVIEW.: Summary first for those in a hurry : 49.9 MB/s write speed, 101 MB/s read speed, tested with USB 3.0 and h2testw 1.4.I'll start with a public service announcement : always buy from reputable sellers, make sure you're getting it from Amazon (or some other reputable seller) and not one of their Marketplace sellers, and even then, make sure you test your card immediately after receiving it.I'm not rating this card 5 stars just because I received it for review under the Vines program. I rated it for its excellent performance, and in my faith that the card will not fail me. I paid full retail for my SanDisk card, and I rated it 5 stars as well, for the same reasons. If either card fails anytime in the future, you can be sure I'll be back here immediately (after trying my best to recover my photos) to edit the review. I've used compact flash cards since 1999, and I haven't had either brand's professional series cards fail yet. And yes, I've had CF cards fail before. Thankfully, that doesn't happen a lot.On the box this card comes in, it states : Minimum Guaranteed Transfer (read speed) : 150 MB/s. Speed based on TestMetrix certified tester. Since I don't have access to one (or even heard of one until today), I did my testing on my i7 920 desktop with a USB 3.0 PCIe card and aTranscend USB 3.0 Super Speed Multi-Card Reader for SD/SDHC/SDXC/MS/CF Cards (TS-RDF8), using h2testw. It's the same setup I've used to test all my recent memory card purchases, as well as cards I received from Vine for review, so there will be a consistent base for comparison.I purchased aSanDisk 32GB Extreme Pro CF memory card - UDMA 90MB/s 600x (SDCFXP-032G-A91, US Retail Package)two months ago, and I'm extremely interested in the difference between the two cards. The SanDisk card is rated at 600x, and the card I received (from a very reputable, authorized U.S. seller that I will not name here) is also marked UDMA 7. Both cards also have the symbol of a movie clapboard with the numbers "20" on it, indicating a guaranteed minimum write speed of 20 MB/s when recording movies.The card came pre-formatted in FAT32, and completely empty. It finished testing without any errors, as expected.The write speed of the card on my hardware is just under 50 MB/s. That's a very respectable speed, but somewhat slower than my SanDisk, much to my surprise. The SanDisk gave me a write speed of 63.2 MB/s. I reformatted the card and tested again, and got the same results.It performed much better than the SanDisk on the read test. I got 101 MB/s read speed, compared to 84.3 MB/s on the SanDisk. So far this is the fastest read speed of any card I've tested. It falls somewhat short of the 150 MB/s claim, but I'm willing to concede that it might be due to my computer, the USB 3.0 card, the reader, or some combination of the above.For a typical user, read speed is more important than write speed, once the write speed is at least fast enough for the device. For example, if you have a relatively new DSLR, you want to make sure that it can record full HD movie at the highest frame rate with all I frames. Even with my 5D III, this card can handle that easily, with speed to spare. A fast read speed, however, saves you time every time you're transferring photos into your computer. So if you don't have a USB 3.0 port and reader on your computer, strongly consider adding one. There are USB 3.0 ExpressCard available for slightly older laptops as well, though I have not tried any and can't recommend one. My USB 3.0 card is a Unitek 2 port PCIe card with NEC chipset.This card is slightly more expensive than the SanDisk at the time I'm writing this review, and while it is faster than the SanDisk for read speed, the write speed is slower (though still very respectable). Which one should you choose? I think it ultimately comes down to brand loyalty. I know people who would swear by one brand over the other. Personally, I've owned many cards of both brands over the years, and have not had any failure. Both companies were also very responsive when I had to contact them - I had to exchange my Lexar Professional 80x 2GB card back in 2005 due to a recall for firmware upgrade, and I had to replace a USB flash drive from SanDisk. Both Lexar and SanDisk Extreme Pro come with lifetime warranties, and include recovery software. I don't think there's a wrong choice with either card.(So why did I pick the SanDisk when I purchased my card 2 months ago? Because at that time the difference in price of the two 32GB cards was around $35)If this card is too expensive for your needs, one step down is the Lexar Professional 400x and SanDisk Extreme, both of which also comes with lifetime warranty.
$SUMMARY.: Very fast read speed, but I couldn't reach 150 MB/s

The OS and all the &#8216;stuff&#8217; Acer put on the machine takes almost 30G so waiting on the 128Gssd was a good idea. There is always that USB3 port you can plug a mini thumb drive into to add space.In the time I have had the machine I have attached to it to wireless projectors and have itrunning all the PC software I run in my office without a hitch.  I keep hinting to the IT guys here they can take my desktop away if I could plug it into our office network, it's that fast, runs multiple monitors (with an added USBtoVGA, one HDMI-VGA is provided), regular kbd and mouse attached no problem.There is no cell radio, I think I can live with that especially since this is a real PC and I can always add a USB Cell adapter if and when I need arrises, there is no GPS, again if I really wanted one, this is a PC but that&#8217;s really pushing things asking for a GPS I think.The only things that don&#8217;t work is loading unsigned drivers (the USB kbd is disabled during boot) and the NOOK App doesn&#8217;t work unless I dumb down the resolution, I&#8217;m sure B&N; will fix that soon enough, until then I&#8217;ll use the PC Nook program.Oh, and surprise, besides the dock, HDMI-VGA, Bluetooth kbd, there was a very nice leatherette cover/case/stand in the box as well.

$review_text.: I really like the capacity of this product, and it is easy to put cds/dvds in and out of the pockets. There isn't soft protection inside the pockets like in my previous (better quality) holder. I will say the exterior is fairly flimsy, very thin, and therefore it makes the zipper somewhat flimsy and cheap. I had a really good quality case before this one that just didn't hold as many, and comparing the two I wish my older one was made to hold more because it was so much better. But for what I need this one does the job, and I won't be zipping and unzipping hastily because I imagine over time that might cause the zipper to rip the casing or cause a tear.

The Disk station supports web servers and all kinds of functions for which you need to do some web development (coding), haven't gone there yet.Overall, an expensive solution that does every thing I need it to do.

$REVIEW.: The SteelSeries Diablo III Headset is the best gaming headset I have ever used. I don't consider myself an audiophile, but I do pride myself on being a musician and noticing the subtle tone changes in certain types of music. These headphones, though built for gaming, handle music and movies extremely well. The microphone is crisp and clear, albeit with no options for editing it. As well the Diablo III branding definitely costs you a penny more, but it's 100% worth it if you're a fan of Diablo in any way.My full review will be live on our website tomorrow which will be a lot more in-depth.This product was sent to me free of charge by SteelSeries for the sole purpose of producing an honest and thorough review of their product.DJ DixonLead Writer/Editor Hardware DepartmentGo!

$REVIEW.: Beautifully crafted, gorgeous OS, smooth transitions. This system is by far the best one made to date. The experience is worth it even to an avid xbox player. I highly recommend this console to anyone. The controller feels so light yet makes great contact with your hands. The triggers feel much nicer than previous versions and the digital joysticks have resistance to give you a lifelike feeling of pushing forward. The only downfall is the battery life of the controller, a little short for my liking.
$SUMMARY.: Beautiful, Gorgeous, and Smooth!

$review_text.: I have an Apple MacPro system running MacOS X 10.4, and I wanted a setup that allows me to use Skype with video and sound. Initially, I thought I need to get a video camera, a microphone and speakers separately.Since the Optia AF has not only a video camera, but also a built-in microphone, I decided to give it a try. I was more than impressed with the ease of use of setting it up: just plug it in a USB port, start up Skype, tell it to use the USB video camera and the USB audio device and everything works perfectly. No need to install any software, it worked out-of-the-box. The camera works great with iChat and PhotoBooth applications too, again without installing additional software.Autofocus is fairly fast in a well lit room, and if you don't move suddenly in front of the camera. As you start moving the camera tends to hunt the focus a little bit, but that's something I'd expect from such cameras.Colors are fairly saturated and the image has good contrast. I like the colors a lot better than those generated by the tiny cameras embedded within the latest generation of iBooks, when used in similar light conditions. The Optia AF is also much better in low light than those cameras, with less grain and better colors.Sound quality is very good. I don't get any echoes even with the computer' speaker close to the camera's microphone. The sound on the other side is natural, without artifacts. The camera's built-in microphone is great, since my desk space is not cluttered with one more thing I need to worry about (wires, additional USB port or line-in, etc).The camera fits very well on an Apple Cinema display, and could be easily oriented to frame you. When the camera is in use, a blue light turns on to indicate it. The camera can be rotated in a position that prevents it from turning on, thus providing privacy when you need it.The only feature missing is the ability to zoom in or out manually, but I don't think it's crucial. The camera's focal length is chosen very well for Skype-type applications (it appears to be the 35mm equivalent of 35mm cameras).I don't have experience setting this up on Windows, but if you're on Mac, I'd highly recommend this camera.
$SUMMARY.: Great camera for Skype and MacOS X

$review_text.: This product works just fine
I still find that the transfer speed is rather slow, despite the USB 3 connection (mainly because my computer only has USB 2; so this "great" feature is useless without the computer having a proper end point)


Also, when I bought this, I needed to reformat the HD instead of it being instantly plug and play

However, I find that's the case with a lot of things that "can also" run on a MAC


In all, it does what I need it to but it's not the love of my life
Good for additional storage, but don't try to play a movie straight from the drive because it'll skip and hang.

$SUMMARY.: Works fine, needed reformatted for MAC

$REVIEW.: This is a new model (out March 2009), and is the just released 'B' version of the popular, judging by the many reviews, samsung 'A' version 32 inch TV. I wanted a TV with an excellent value for a 32 inch TV with a good 720p picture and sound.  The picture is actually fantastic and looks good on the standard setting and really stunning at the dynamic setting (if the room is light enough), and in the store looked slightly better thenSony Bravia S-Series KDL-32S5100 32-Inch 1080p LCD HDTV, Blackeven though that TV is a 1080p one. I did a visual comparison of the two for a while in the store becuase I was trying to justify going 1080p but couldnt since this picture seemed better even at 720p. If I could, I would have gone for theSony BRAVIA XBR KDL-32XBR9 32-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTVwhich looked the best though for a 32 inch overall.720p vs 1080p:I couldn't understand why a 1080p TV would make a difference with this size of TV, since I sit about nine feet away and at that distance I don't think you could tell - at least the PC input is small enough and sharp enough that I can read web pages comfortably from my couch but if it were any smaller it would be too small/detailed. I dont think I would use more than 720p detail unless I wanted to see more web page content on the screen and planned to sit about 4 feet away. The TV has exactly the same resolution asToshiba Satellite U305-S2804 13.3-inch Laptop (Intel Core 2 Duo T5450 Processor, 2 GB RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, Vista Premium)which is what I plugged into the PC input and looks identical to that screen. Also, most Hi Def inputs to my TV aren't more than 720p anyway. I think one over the air station is 1080i.Standard DEF Input Handling:For 480i or standard def inputs at a non wide screen resolution, such as those from my cable box, it handles it extremely well. However, I have a digital cable box (verizon QIP6416-2) with an HMDI, component, svideo, and RCA even though the signal I get is only standard def. I didn't want to use up an HDMI port on the TV so I tried connecting the component but the color didn't work. This is an issue with the cable box, not the TV. I had to use the HDMI in the end since there was no s-video (a small negative for this TV) and didnt want to use the RCA. On the plus side, this TV has a great setting called wide fit/move that slightly streaches and zooms a 4/3 picture to fit the 16/9 widescreen. The move comes into play if you have channel that has scrolling text that becomes cut off at the bottom, so you can nudge the picture up a bit (which chops off the top more but you need to make a comprimose somewhere).Shines with HD inputs:When I hooked the component connections up to an HD upscaling DVD playerSamsung DVD-HD860 Up-Converting DVD Playerthough that worked perfectly with the component connection.  My beloved RokuRoku Digital Video Playerbox is using the 2nd HDMI connector which looks great, and the over the air antennaCLEARSTREAM2 Antennabrings in over the air free HD on about 20 HD channels. All the HD sources (laptop, antenna, roku, upscaling DVD) really shine. Sound is good and I don't feel I need to get add on home theater sound since I dont turn the TV up loud.  I guess an extra HDMI connection would have been nice, especially since there was no S-video, but I still give the TV 5 stars as it is a new model and is thus forward looking.

$REVIEW.: My wife and I bought this unit along with a spare battery and CaseLogic case for our honeymoon in Europe. It went with us everywhere for 11 days in pockets and strapped to wrists. In the process, it got banged around a lot and rained on, and never had any issues. It was always there for us and started right up in 2 seconds or less; we never missed anything. We read reviews and accordingly set it to 720p, 60 frames per second. We bought 2 16GB class 6 SDHC cards for it and each one lasted for about 3 hours 50 minutes at these resolution settings. The video looks amazing! So much so that my home PC doesn't have anough power to play it smoothly without caching. The only very minor gripe I would share about this unit is that the battery only lasts about 50 minutes if you leave it on and frequently start and stop recording, which you probably will at an event, etc. Buy a spare battery! We got a wide range of stuff, from the Lippizaner Stallions in Vienna to the beerhalls at Oktoberfest, and everything looks like it was shot on a pro movie camera. Obviously, we avoided a lot of low-light situations since this beast has no flash, but it did well on lit objects at night like cathedrals, clock towers, etc. Oh, and I also pre-emptively put a small piece of GPS protective screen film on the screen before the trip, so I can't speak to the other reviews of the screen scratching easily. HIGHLY recommend this unit. At this price it can't be touched, and I'm glad we used it so our memories are so perfect of our trip.

$REVIEW.: This is one of the most expensive FM transmitters you can buy. Some of these type units sell for $10 and up. The quality and strength of the FM transmission is very good. It still sounds like an FM transmission but the signal output is strong.After getting this and discovering that the remote did not work at all, initially I did not care. However, I listen to long podcasts that I download from my computer and transfer to my USB stick. You can only fast forward with the remote and the unit does not remember where you left off if you turn the car off. So I would be an hour into my podcast recording and turn the car off. I could not fast forward to my previous point without the remote, which was new defective for me. The remote is very fragile and thin and uses expensive watch type batteries.If you just listen to mp3 songs than I could recommend this product.Amazon was great about the return and refunded me the full amount which is why I shop here.

$review_text.: My initial impression of the &#34;HooToo HT-UH008 USB 3.0 Hub, 7 Port, Bus-Powered&#34; was favorable, as it seemed to work with no problems. Just now however, after seven days of use, none of the ports were working, even though the power light was on and the hub is plugged into a power adapter. I left a flash drive in one slot and unplugged the power adapter -- and the hub started working again. Plugged the power adapter back in, and it still works. So...for the reasons given below, I'll give it another two weeks, and if it behaves itself, I'll keep it.Here are the pros:- Works for low-power devices even when not plugged into the power adapter. Even my USB 3.0 portable hard drive worked -- but at about 10% of its normal performance.- With the power adapter plugged in, and several low-power/low-bandwidth USB 2.0 peripherals plugged in -- keyboard, flash drive, printer -- the USB 3.0 hard drive achieved the same throughput when plugged into the hub as when plugged directly into the computer.- There's lots of room between the USB ports, making plugging/unplugging easy.

$REVIEW.: This is my first portable, bluetooth speaker, and I am pleased


 The sound is clear, crisp and a perfect combination of bass and treble
 It was easy to connect my Droid 4 phone using the bluetooth feature


 I didn't even have to read the manual, it was that simple


 I plugged it in, and while it was charging, I connected my phone to Sirius and rocked out to my tunes
 It seemed to take a couple hours to fully charge the first time


 It is bigger than I thought it would be, but it's not so big that it takes up a lot of space.I have been wanting something to play my Sirius radio on, and this works in that I can use the Sirius application on my phone to connect

 The sound is better then the speakers on my computer, and they are nice speakers.I wish you had the ability to adjust the sound components such as the bass
This also is listed as an Ipod dock, however, there is no Ipod dock


 You need to have an Ipod that connects wirelessly


 I have an old Ipod, so I can't use it with this speaker, however, my phone connects perfectly.Others have covered specifics about this speaker, so I am not going to go into that


 If you want a speaker that is easy to tote around with the carrying case that comes with it, charges easily, is very user friendly, and has great sound, then this speaker is for you.

$REVIEW.: I had purchased this light after reading the product description and NOT the technical details. Below is a cut and paste of the product description.*********Product DescriptionPOLAROID "LED" LIGHTING SOLUTIONSRegardless if you shoot your videos with a pocket size "Flip" style unit, a still camera with video mode or HD-capable digital SLR, you'll immediately appreciate what our LED Light Bar lighting solutions add to your videos.Thanks to our "Daylight Tuned" pure white LED's, you enjoy the same kind of 'daytime-white' light the pros do-at a fraction of the cost. More than great lighting Polaroid LED's are also designed for versatility.Case in point, thanks to their exclusive integrated expansion mounts they're "stackable" so you can combine them to 'build" a wall of light. In addition, our compact LED & Infra-Red models are rechargeable so they provide about an hour of quality illumination with no worries about wires or wall outlets.Plus, our top of the line unit features a built in dimmer so you can adjust the lighting level to exactly what's needed for a particular shooting situation-video or still. That's because our cool running LED lights are designed for "always on" use, rapidly becoming the pro's choice for portraiture or any situation where controlled light is key.If you're looking for a more traditional lighting solution, our camcorder video light is a "single bulb" solution that delivers a full 3 watts of illumination that's color balanced to produce even, natural results.For brilliant videos and stunning stills, give Polaroid Lighting Solutions a shot********So as you can see one might think this light would work for all cameras. My Sony CX-110 while being an awesome little camcorder does not have IR capabilities so I sent the light back without ANY problems at all.I ordered a used Sony DCR-SR100 from Amazon just for the "Nightshot", as soon as it gets in my hands I will test the 0 lux and if I'm happy with it I will be reordering this Polaroid IR night light. I have watched reviews on youtube and I have no doubts that it will perform to my expectations.

The initial color correction was crap compared to the Huey Pro I have (worked right out of the box) and have been using.  Once tech told me the steps via email my results turned out better.

$REVIEW.: If you have a good size HDTV that lacks the `smart' features that new models come with, but it has an HDMI Interface input; by using the Actiontec SBWD100A01 ScreenBeam Pro with it you can use your HDTV to project your laptop display or tablet, and surf the web, watch videos, play games, etc
The Actiontec SBWD100A01 ScreenBeam Pro supports PC or laptops with 4th Generation Intel WiDi components, or mobile devices with Wi-Fi Direct to establish a Miracast connection

The setup requires some effort, but once done, it's like having a brand new HDTV


One can share photos from a Smartphone into the big screen for all the family to see, or stream video for everybody to enjoy.I like the feature that extends the screen for multitasking, so while the kids watch videos on the HDTV, one can do something else in the laptop


This comes particularly handy, if one has children that argue for the control of the device that is streaming the movie

For example, a kid that likes to fast forward, while the other likes to repeat the same segment over and over again (I have both)

Before I lose my sanity, I have to take over, so they both watch the same thing at the same pace without destroying an expensive device in the process

If only for this situation, getting the Actiontec SBWD100A01 ScreenBeam Pro is a great investment.

And it last for 35 min, before packaging it back and requesting a refund from amazon.So, it does have a nice charging feature, but it stops there

The manual tuning is horrible


Remember the old radios from the 80's? That's how you are suppose to tune this thing
It's very sensitive, leaving no room for mistakes

I was playing xbox 360, and took me around 5 minutes to finally get a good enough sound
Forget about amazing stereo sound, it really sounds like an analogic radio at best
And then, I decided to change seats from the couch to the chair, a loud interference noise almost gave me a heart attack.Don't waste your money on this, save a little bit more and get a descent headphone

There was no noticeable visibility issue, the glare is substantially improved, and the film was easy to install.The key to proper installation really does seem to be putting it in place in a bathroom with hot water running, since the steam keeps the dust out of the air


It is very difficult to prevent any dust whatsoever from getting in, but this has been the best method to minimize it
Frankly, a couple bits of dust are hardly even an issue as they aren't even visible with the ipad running.

$REVIEW.: If you subscribe to minimum rated data over cable Internet access, the Scientific Atlanta DOC2100R2 will work fine

I have received this device in 2012 free from Cox Cable in NW Florida and for $7 per month from Comcast Cable in SW Florida

It is now available as a used cable modem from Amazon for $7
As a cable Internet access minimum cost / rate user, you can probably attain speeds comparable to telephone wire DSL if not better.To unlock the potential of cable access, first read what the Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) is all about


Your cable Internet provider by 2012 is probably now supporting DOCSIS version 3.0 since it was finalized in 2006 to replace the 2.0 version released in 2001

In theory, any cable modem that meets DOCSIS standards and is supported by your cable provider should be comparable to any other same-DOCSIS rated device

The key variable here is the cable-provider's responsiveness to implementing new DOCSIS standards and writing a software interface to provision your specific device
The second key variable is the manufacture's hardware / firmware implementation of the DOCSIS standard, especially with version 3.0 and its multi-channel variants.The SA 2100R2 is not much different from similar DOCSIS 2.0 devices form other manufacturers
The firmware that operates the modem may well be the same used by different manufactures and the actual hardware probably comes from the same China factory that places a different case on it!A DOCSIS 2.0 device should attain up to 38 Mbits/sec (Million bits not bytes) down and 27 Mbits/sec up


A DOCSIS 3.0 device can obtain up to 304 Mbits/sec down and 108 Mbits/sec up using an 8/4 bonded channel configuration


More important than just speed, version 3.0 adds management over IPv6, the new Internet expanded address scheme and better encryption to better isolate your cable from your neighbors.In conclusion, if you are a minimal Internet service level user, this DOCSIS 2.0 device is fine but I would not lease it at $7/mo.I hope to receive a new DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem from Amazon today


I justify its cost with its pay back of less than 12 months


Since I subscribe to a higher service level, I also should attain speeds up to 9x higher than with this 2100R2 DOCSIS 2.0 device at no incremental fee to Comcast
In addition, I gain support for IPv6 Internet sites and enhanced security.Unfortunately, without open competition and more astute regulatory supervision , Comcast and other cable access providers are not rushing to certify its support for user-purchased cable modems

I opted to buy a DOCSIS 3.0 device released 4 years ago since it is finally supported by Comcast here

I would have preferred another brand that offers full 8/4 bonding and enhanced modulation features, but the only two Comcast supported devices from this manufacture are also 4 years old and not even end-user marketed by the manufacturer any more.

$REVIEW.: So I've read a bunch of complaints and have answers, but first, I want to explain why I gave it a 4/5.I gave this item a 4/5 because:-The sound is great, it's very clear.BUT, there isn't a lot of bass in the headphones. It's still there, but there is more "treble" than "bass". So the sound really depends on personal preference. If you like a lot of bass, you may need to look at different headphones. I personally would prefer more bass than what was produced through these headphones.-The built is pretty sturdy.-They are pretty comfortable.- I gave a 4/5 because I wish there was a setting that I could use to adjust bass/treble of headphones, because adjusting the EQ on my iPhone does not cut it, and these things below:-Heavy... this depends on the user/how long you have the headphones on, I think the weight's fine, but could be better.-Batteries... if you use your headphones a lot, you will go through more than expected AAA batteries.Bottom line: The pros outweigh the cons, but the cons are still noteworthy (they are worth about $200 in my opinion)So I've read reviews that the one ear doesn't work.The one ear doesn't work for a reason---Your batteries are dead, or you haven't put them in. Mine did the left ear mono play thing, and the sound was really low when it played in both ears (one setting = left ear, other = sound is low)--- but then I put the batteries in, waited a couple of minutes, and they worked terrifically with noise-cancellation.Comparision with SL150's (200$ white ones):The sound is different. I liked the SL150's because of the bass, and I like these ones because of the clarity. Personal Preference, but I wish bass/clarity was combined to make an ultimately great headphone.Built is different. The BLACK AND WHITE SL300s are sturdy/heavy, the WHITE SL150's are light and weak-- I broke my WHITE SL150's within 3 days. BLACK AND WHITE SL300s did not break.Comfortably is different. SL300s are far more better... SL150's hurt my ears.Bottom line: At the prices now, I would rather pay 40-60 more dollars to get the SL300s than the SL150s, the problems with the SL150s aren't worth saving $40-60 - unless you will not break them and will listen to music for no more than an hour a day.
$SUMMARY.: Everything was to my liking.

$REVIEW.: I am comparing this projector to it's smaller brother (500 lumen PB63) and a NEC 2600 lumen budget projector.In terms of picture quality and brightness, the PA75 was no better than the tiny PB63, but it was a little quieter (not much).  Considering the PA75 is about 3 times the size of the PB63 (the PB63 is the size of a 2.5 portable hard drive) and claims a 40% additional brightness, this was very disappointing.The final nail in PA75's coffin was it's focus issues. Used for text, the projector was always very soft and a little blurry, even at the best focus settings. On top of this, the focus was un-even thought the projections, almost sharp in a few spots, head-ache causing blurry in others. The tiny PB63 did not have this issue.If I had not seen the PB63 in action, I would choke up all the shortcomings a to budget (relatively) high mobility LED design, but in terms of picture quality, its worse than the PB63, mostly due to the broken focus.The budget NEC ($420) is significantly better in terms of picture quality, and the focus works. I guess I am back to replacing bulbs :(

$REVIEW.: I used the Quick Installation Guide and software installation CD that came with the camera and installation videos on You Tube. I found that between the two I was able to have a painless installation. The F19910W is quite bulky and I purchased the Black one which seem to be very well made and sturdy (and weighty) in construction. This is not a web cam that you will easily hide and you need to think along the lines of disguising it's profile somehow.The cameras performance is very good and pans and tilts to the software commands very well.You can also listen to sound in it's vicinity and it has a small speaker in which you can speak through, although the level of sound is quite low.I downloaded and installed IP Cam Viewer Pro by Robert Chou both on my Ipad and also on my Android Nook. This is the icing on the cake as the software enables you to control the Web Cam very well and i highly recommend it.The price has gone up $10 since I purchased the web cam which is rather annoying as I was considering purchasing another but will wait until they are on sale.Overall a good purchase and allows us the ability to view our home when we are away and also to get email alarms if we arm the motion sensing. There is also the ability to take a snapshot and record video too. Just bear in mind this is a web cam and not a professional high quality surveillance camera. For value for money it is pretty good but it would seem they are pushing up the price.Unfortunately mine had or developed a sound problem where the sound was distorted and weak. A call to Amazon and the item was replaced. All is well with the replacement camera though it's software was not the same as that which comes with the "white model" hoping that Foscam has released the software update for the camera's UI as they said it would be available in Jan 2013. I have yet to check as yet.

$REVIEW.: I have only had this for a couple of days, but so far I love it!  It is very light, but well made. The sound is excellent and has very good volume. The power button starts my audio-books automatically from my iPhone, so I don't have to mess with my phone to start listening. It has good battery life. Its buttons are durable and have very functional features. I haven't had a chance to test the waterproofness, but I like the idea, so I can take it out to the yard when I garden. It works great in my car, also. Excellent speaker! I purchased mine from Costco. It came with a kit that included a suction mount, car charger, wall charger, cord and clip. Got it for $60.UPDATE: I am sorry to, but I have to deduct two stars.  I have tested this on two speakers to make sure it wasn't just a glitch with one. They are VERY temperature sensitive. The daily high has been 90F or less. I have been leaving it in my car, in the center console and the car has been in the shade with the windows cracked. The car is warm, but not nearly as hot as it can get. Sadly, after being in the car, under these conditions, all day, it no longer works. The volume is so low, I can put it against my ear and still not be able to hear it very well. If you try to turn it up, it doesn't get much louder, but it does start vibrating terribly. It doesn't start working propertly again until it is completely cooled down in an air conditioned room. For a rugged outdoor device, I find this to be unacceptable. It reduces the functionality significantly. I don't know how you could use it on a very sunny day, next to a pool of water, without it completely failing.

I recieved the keyboard fast and simply plugged it in and it works flawlessly. I have not run the cd that comes with it yet and don't know that I will. I love the feel of this keyboard and it is really nice to be able to use it without the need to turn on lights which bother my eyes while using the computer and watching TV. There are two levels of brightness or you can turn off the lighted keys. It is also a really nice looking keyboard with a really nice feel to it. I would never be satisfied with a regular keyboard after using this one.Judy

I have a klipsch icon center channel, and a 47&#34; lg LED tv, when I sat the center speaker in front of the tv, it was too tall, and I was concerned that this stand would be flimsy or would rattle, and it has done neither.It gives you the option of two mounting points, I chose the closer ones since my center channel is front heavy, giving it more support in the center, and I am thrilled with it. I was starting to hate my 2nd system because I was using the front towers as a virtual center channel, and it sounded horrible, this allowed me to put my full size center where I wanted, and it has made a huge difference.

$review_text.: When I look for a good head set to do yard work, or work out with, I quite frequently seek out a comfort fit, with tight bass, a good battery life, and an affordable price


This is precisely what I have found with the Avantree Hive headphones.Standing at a meager 180 grams worth of weight, the Avantree Hive Headphones have an ample over-the-ear, stylish look

The headphones feel comfortable, but they do not hug your ears like some high-end headphones do


They tend to still sit on top of your ear, instead of wrapping around it.Unwrapping the box, you get the feeling from this product like it might be a high-end product, but you know you paid less than 20% of the price of the leading expensive headsets, yet you have problems figuring out quite why.In the casing you find a male to male headphone cord, which allows the headphones to act not only as a bluetooth set, but a corded set as well for any 3.5mm compatible headphone jack (almost every jack for audio there is on modern electronics).The headphones lasted for hanging by the pool, cutting the grass, and then hanging by the pool again, through roughly 7 hours worth of time
The bass was deep, the volume loud, precisely what I demand out of a headset.To my suprise, the phone rang halfway through, and I immediately thought: &#8220;These have no microphone sticking down, I have to pick up the phone.&#8221; However, when I picked up the phone I quickly learned that indeed there is a microphone built in on the side of the unit that actually has a pretty good pick up


I talked while doing yard work with no issues
From a budget head set, I was flabbergasted.All in all, you simply can not go wrong with Avantree Hive Bluetooth Headphones


In the highest classes of head sets, these compete
In the affordable  class of head phones, these destroy the competition.UPDATE:After a couple of weeks, I lost the cap on the side....................I'm now not so happy.

$review_text.: This is one of the few USB 3.0 hubs that provides full power to each port -- The AC adaptor provides a full 4.0amps (4000 milliamps). Under the USB 3.0 spec, each port should be given 900milliamps (USB 2.0 maxes out at 500mA). So 4 ports at 900mA = 3600milliamps. If you plan on using a lot of bus powered devices (like portable hard drives), this is absolutely critical. With the IOGEAR hub, I was able to connect four portable drives off the hub and they were all bus powered and worked perfectly at super-speed. Even if you don't end up buying this hub, make sure the AC adaptor of the hub you choose can provide enough power to all your ports. I took off one start because the AC adaptor plug doesn't fit perfectly flush with the unit.

It is.A couple of sites mentioned that the type of cable used with a digital camera would work with the 9500ix
Well the one I have would not have done the job, and I am very glad I did not try to force the matter
The mini-B end of the Amazon cable is a perfect fit for the Escort Passport 9500ix.Beyond that, Amazon can be proud of itself for putting its name on what I believe is an excellent cable: sturdy, well made
Certainly worth more than what Amazon asks for it

The touch-pad would be a great thing if it worked well, and as I never had issues getting songs transferred to the player, I did have problems accessing them from the player.Many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all> I would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well. It is the 'first generation' of the player, and while I still agree that it is a great alternative to the iPod, I think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck.If someone asked me flat out, i'd say to go woth something else.

$review_text.: I ordered my Kindle-Fire on the first day it was offered (and love it). When it arrived I was surprised that it did not come with this type of cable for transferring photos. It would be a big plus for the buyer, because it is so cool to share photos on this, they are nice and bright and the perfect sharing-size. Keep in mind that I bought this cable for it in November, right after my Fire arrived, and at that time, this cable was $.98 plus shipping of $2.97. Yes, ninety-eight CENTS.  I just looked at the going price for this item today and cannot believe it is now $10.00 (demand apparently). I think if I was able to buy this so inexpensively Amazon could've acquired this at even less and charged the extra dollar for it with the K-Fire price. How cool that would've been for us buyers.As for the product, it works very well!  Just remember that you have to turn the K-Fire on first, power it up, in order to transfer photos or files. It won't work otherwise. A simple thing, but some overlook that apparently from what I have read in other reviews.UPDATE: Jan 3, 2012 -- see the comments following my review. I was informed by the manufacturer that what I received for 98 cents +S&H; was not an original product by Gator Crunch, but an imitation. The red threads in the cord are the distinction of the original and mine do not have it. I ordered mine early in the time frame of the K-Fire release, so he could assure me that it was not the real thing, based on the date it was shipped.  I have addressed the issue with the supplier (CrazyOnDigital) and Amazon and waiting to hear what will be done. I think they should replace it with what I ordered in good faith, irregardless of what I paid for it at the time. We shall see and I will update my review. The manufacturer has also notified Amazon of this illegal use of their products name.

$review_text.: This camera is amazing, it is also amazingly complicated.  On the other hand it has many automatic settings that seem to work fine.  The main point of this review has to do with DSLR cameras.  I have used high quality film type SLR cameras for 40 years, however I have not had a DSLR, and was going to buy one.  After using this camera, I can't imagine ever owning a DSLR.  Why?  Because this camera for the average enthusiast, someone like me, does everything you could do with a DSLR and three separate lenses for about 1/5th the price and 1/10th the weight.  I am sure it does not have the rugged construction of a DSLR, but most people do not need that. An additional plus, if you are into video, you no longer need a special camera for that.  It is sort of like, in concept, a smart phone that replaces a number of different special use gadgets (PDA, voice recorder, camera, video, etc.).One other thought, technology changes at an amazing pace, unless you are a professional, why spend extra money for unneeded durability and extra long life if it is going to be out of date in three years?  I rarely wear out a camera, phone, computer, etc.  I normally replace such things because the new ones have attractive features that make the old ones obsolete.  Until something better comes along, I am stuck on "super zoon" cameras like this one.  I don't know much about the competition, but this is a great one at an attractive price.  Before buying I looked closely at the features and reviews of all major brands.  This camera seemed to have the most loyal following with the fewest complaints.  I imagine the others to be quite good, but this one is for sure.
$SUMMARY.: If you are considering a DSLR, look at this camera first

$review_text.: If you are new to photography, or are simply looking to switch from point-&-click to SLR, this is a perfect camera to get! I've been an amateur photographer for a number of years, taking classes and seminars whenever I can, but I've just never had the money for a good SLR camera. The Nikon D3000 was my choice when I finally decided to buy a good camera because of its ease of use, quality of photographs, and comparatively inexpensive price.In the six months I have owned this camera I have taken over 200 gigabytes of photographs in three different countries, and I have not been disappointed. It may not have all the bells and whistles that a D90 or D300 has, but it certainly gets the job done well. I recommend this camera to anyone who is looking to upgrade to a DSLR. This camera is simply amazing!
$SUMMARY.: Great entry-level SLR camera!

It is very soft, and I don't have to worry about scratching the glass surface of my (very expensive) TV


I wipe the dust off the TV every day, since it seems to be an extreme dust magnet


I always shake out the cloth afterward, but after about a month, it seemed like I could feel some dust in the cloth, so I decided to wash it

I have a couple of different headsets in this price range, and they seem stronger and are a better fit. Maybe I was soured by the rubber bits that kept falling off the hard plastic.

$REVIEW.: [...]The Gist:The Toshiba REGZA 42" LCD is a great buy and I'm really happy with it. Sporting a sweet, sexy gloss look and high quality video, it's definitely a purchase I'd make again. For very picky users, I'd recommend getting the new 120Hz version so that motion blur will be non-existent. Again, it's hardly noticeable.It has plenty of connections, tons of tweaking features, awesome color and picture quality, and is easy to use.AudioFrom what I've heard, the TV audio isn't so bad. It's not amazing, but that is really expected. However, I did hook it up right away to our home theater system. I use the Fixed Audio out to route the audio from all the components into the home theater box. Since my home theater system only has one audio input, this was a big plus.Standard DefinitionSD is where all LCDs fail. You shouldn't buy an LCD with the thought that you will be mostly viewing SD material (SD defined by me as 480i and 480p material).With that said, this TV presents SD in above average quality. Our cable box is 1080i but most material is output in 480p. I would safely say that I could watch a regular cable TV channel and not pull my eyes out. It's not that bad. It's acceptable.High Definition Digital CableHD channels that don't have true HD material playing looks a little bit better than the 480p channels but still not excellent.HD channels playing true HD material look great. It's still digitally compressed, but it's definitely leagues above the standard definition. For comparison, it's not as sharp as Blu-Ray, but definitely good nonetheless.True 1080p MaterialHere is where the money's at. Plug in a PS3 or Xbox 360 or Blu-Ray player in 1080p and you've got pixel sharp resolution.If you are a gamer or an HD nut and own 1080p devices then this TV will not disappoint. I was blown away by the picture, it's incredibly sharp. I've seen the Blu-Ray picture in the store and it's just as incredible.ColorAnother reason I bought this TV, it has every feature you'd need to tweak it for days. Not only does it let you tweak picture options like Color, Tint, Sharpness, Backlight, Contrast, Brightness, and Static Gamma, but you can also tweak Red, Green, Blue, Cyan, Yellow, and Magenta. It also has a handful of advanced options like B Drive and G Drive, basically everything you need.

 The charger also works well, but once the charge is full, it begins to emit an awful, high pitched noise


 Not a deal breaker, especially since an audible notification of the charge finishing has advantages, but it has woken me up in the middle of the night, so it isn't great either.

$REVIEW.: I have previously tried the Logitech M510 and the M705 marathon mouse.  I found both uncomfortable to hold because the "ergonomic" feature in those 2 mouses groove in where the thumb rests, making it very uncomfortable to hold.  I returned both of those mice before settling for the Anywhere mouse. This mouse's thumb rest area does not groove in as much and feels much more like a cheap plain standard mouse, which I am used to, so I LOVE it.  The mouse is not too small at all.It comes in a very pretty matte black color.  My previous mouse was a plain standard 2 click and scroll mouse. With this mouse, there are additional features to have webpage go backward and forwards, as well as scrolling left and right with the use of the scroll wheel. I don't know how often I will resort to these new special buttons, but it's great to have.

$review_text.: Pro:- works very reliably- sound quality is better than expected considering the price- battery life is best in class- lightweight and unobtrusive fitCons:- the plastic ear clips are prone to breaking and a replacement set will set you back 20% of the cost of the headset itself. There simply has to be a better way to design this aspect of the headset using a more flexible clip material.- the buttons are not very usable when the headset is on your ear, but fortunately this is not a big issue because most people will use their smartphone to control the headset.Lastly, several reviewers have commented that this headset would not pair with their laptops. I had no such problems, am using Win8 on a Lenovo Yoga.

$REVIEW.: Received Garmin GPS 1490LMT December 2012.Comes with preloaded August 2012 maps.Needs more memory right out of box on first map update today.Had to telephone Garmin Customer Service.Garmin Customer Service will send at no charge a 4GB SD card.Some forums state to delete foreign languages and other non needed stuff on Garmin.That does  not work as maps are getting bigger and bigger.So, item does work right out of the box


 All OK.But for future lifetime maps one does need to use the expansion slot.And Garmin is sending an SD card for no charge.BUT
 Why didn't Garmin include the SD card IN the box?Apparently, Garmin must have made a lot of these not thinking ahead.Apparently, the marketinng, designers, and sales people do not talk to each other at Garmin.This is the LAST Garmin GPS that speaks the word "RECALCULATING".This is the only reason I purchased this Garmin

 I need the word "RECALCULATING"  for the conditions I travel under.All Garmins do recalculate the routes
 The newer ones do this silently


 Fine for some/many but  not for me.I require a verbal sound of "RECALCULATING" for my driving


 I must and need to know voice/verbally when I am off route.I do extensive driving across country.Garmin should simply put on the "RECALCULATING" on all Garmins and just have an ON and OFF tab/button for this and please all.This will be my last new Garmin until the "RECALCULATING" comes back.I also have a Garmin Nuvi older 350 as a back up

 Still running strong.This 1490LMT and the older 350 both have NA or US and Canada maps.This unit has a 2GB internal memory.All/most of the newer ones have a 4GB internal memory.Update:  July 2013.Was having an issue with the touch screen


 Some of the letters on each side had to press harder or more times for it to work.Telephoned Garmin


 Customer Service had me reset or some such wording - the screen
 All works perfectly now.Drove across country twice with this Garmin
 Nearly excellent but a few oddities
 On highway in large city (St
Louis going west to east) and Garmin lady states - stay right - but I was entering an intersection with a 5 way split

 Had to really watch the highway signs on that one.

$review_text.: I recently upgraded from a first gen iPad to the iPad 4, and before and even after the purchase I was unsure of what case to get.  I had my heart set on cases from Speck, either the FitFolio or the PixelSkin HD.  I loved the style of the their cases for the iPad 1.  TheirSpeck Products Apple iPad Fitted Case in Classic Plaid (Pink and Gray), IPAD-FTD-A02A020(1st Generation)was my case of choice.  But after looking at some reviews and seeing some hands-on footage of the newer models I decided to pass.  I looked up some reviews on Youtube and saw these cases from Poetic.  The had the style and functionality I wanted in a case and seemed to offer decent protection.I loved the Laidback's design most of all and was shocked to see it for $4 here on Amazon so I snatched it up as soon as I could.  I got the Strapback for my wife who will be getting an iPad 3 soon.  Both cases feel great in hand, I prefer the Laidback because of its simplicity of design.  In landscape mode, you only have to tuck the cover behind the flap in the back and you can view it fine in viewing or typing mode.  It doesn't tip over easily when using the iPad in its more upright viewing mode, even on the bed.  And while I was worried about it not folding flat on the back when I wanted to hold it, it turned out to not be a problem.  It actually fits well in my hand that way.  It also keeps the cover out of the way of the camera when I take pictures with it.  Something I've found myself addictively doing now that I've gotten used to the iPad 4's camera.For the price I got it, or even in the $20 range I couldn't see myself buying anything else for my iPad.  I highly recommend the Laidback style of case, or even thePoetic StrapBack Rigid Leather Wraped Case with Multi-Stand Options for The NEW iPad (3rd generation) / iPad 3 / iPad 2 Blue - Support Auto Wake/Sleep Function(3 Year Manufacturer Warranty From Poetic), to stylishly and securely hold you iPad 3 or 4.Also, here are some of the Youtube reviews I used for reference.

$REVIEW.: When I bought this laptop last year, I immediately upgraded the ram to 4GB, and added Windows 7. Windows 7 runs very well on here, even better than Vista. The laptop does get pretty warm, but a cooling pad solves that. I have had absolutely no issues with this laptop. It starts up quickly, even faster than my desktop which is a 2.6 dual core pentium with 4 gigs of ram. The keyboard is very comfortable to type on. I wish the mouse had a scroll on it, but otherwise it is easy to use. My 6 year old twins can use the laptop with ease. We have played a few games on here as well, and it handles them fine. Overall it is a great laptop for the price. I do recommend the upgraded ram, and the operating system is obviously what you prefer. I prefer Windows 7.

$REVIEW.: (also posted for the Canon version)I have been using the lens with my Nikon D70 for over a year, and I am very happy with it. I use the lens for most of my day to day shooting.(+) 10mm focal length - Yee haa! One year after, and I still can't get the smirk off my face. Even with the accompanied pincushion distorsion (see below) the 10mm focal length is simply a joy (Nikon's zoom only goes as wide as 12mm, 12 is noticable narrower than 10).(+) Optical quality - is very good as far as I can judge. There is a pretty noticeable pincushion distorion at the 10mm end, but I understand all ultra-wide zooms suffer from the same phenomena. The distorsion at 12mm focal length is far less noticable.(+) Build quality - no complaints. except for this lens I also own Sigma's 30mm f/1.4 lens (which has disappointing optical performance IMO). 30mm's optical issues aside, - both feel solid and stable, no loose rings or levers or anything like that. Sigma does an excellent job here.(+) HSM focusing works very well, my guess is that Nikon would be as good or perhaps slightly better. One of the other non-Nikon alternative uses the screwdriver blade type auto focus rather than ultrasonic motor (the built it ultrasonic AF is way nicer to use).All the negatives or 'cons' if you will, are right there in the data sheet, no unpleasent surprises whatsoever. The lens is big and heavy but so is the competition (Nikon). I wish it could go a little further to say 22mm or 25mm, but again - I knew it won't, before I bought it. As a Nikon owner I don't really think there a significantly better choice, if you own a Canon DSLR body though, then the EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 USM lens may be a better choice.5 start with no hesitation, no other DSLR lens I know gives so much value for the money! (except, perhaps, for that 10-22 canon lens, which is the forbidden fruit for us Nikonians).

$REVIEW.: I have purchased several HDMI cables over the years and have run into problems with each, until I tried the Mediabridge Ultra Series offered by Amazon.com. I have now purchased both a 25-foot cable and a 10-foot cable. I have found the Mediabridge cables to be economically priced but, importantly, they are a high quality cable, fitting snugly (unlike many of they other cables I tried) into place and performing very well.
$SUMMARY.: Very reliable HDMI cables

$REVIEW.: The power supply is great, and I like the hybrid modularized aspect.  However, the fan is a little on the noisy side.  I have 3 120 mm case fans in the case, and this by far is noisier than all three put together.  I used this in a build for my uncle, so I'm hoping he won't notice.  If you don't care about noise, then this is a perfect PSU.The modular connections are great, which include connectors for all the standard PCI-E and SATA power connectors.  The non-modular cables are the motherboard power cables.  Everything worked without issue.

$review_text.: I have never really "gotten into" listening to iPods, portable MP3 players, etc

 The sound quality of the typical earbuds was dreadful, and I prefer regular speakers--even good PC speakers.That has changed with the Fosgate Punch Plugs

 These offer great bass and sound quality

 For me, loudness was never a problem


 An annoyance with conventional ear buds was they easily fall out
 I like these in that they have a variety of fitment plugs.About the only nits I have are the size isn't as compact as usual earbuds and the price

 The price easily exceeds a lot of MP3 players.

$REVIEW.: When I ordered the Kindle Paperwhite I also ordered the Folio Case.  However the case I received was for the Kindle Fire.  Not a very good fit. There is no way to secure the Kindle in the case while the case is open.  The Kindle just slides around in the case.  Also the picture of the case shows the Kindle being held on a slant for reading.  The slot is not deep enough to hold the Kindle on a slant.  The case came about a month before the Kindle since the Kindle did not ship until October.

$review_text.: you are going to find out a few things while researching hdmi cable options.1) hdmi cables carry digital signals with error correction, any signal that is strong enough to be decoded by your tv is 100% identical to the one that your set top box is sending.  spending extra money to get a better picture or sound would be a waste.2) the longer the cable, the more signal will be lost in transit.  even with signal loss the picture and sound will be 100% identical until at some point this loss becomes significant enough that the tv can not decode the stream anymore.  you may get nothing, or you may get an intermittent picture, or a blotchy picture.  the rule of thumb for this is a maximum cable length of about 33ft.3) cables longer than 33ft can be made usable by introducing more expensive techniques, adding shielding, or using repeaters.  there are cables on the market that can go much further but expect to pay much more for them, since they involve more materials and possibly some patents.this cable is probably the longest hdmi cable you will be able to buy that is of sufficient build quality that you will get a reliable enough signal to not have dropouts or other problems.  it is pushing the hdmi spec past the maximum limit though so it may not work for everyone, but it looks like it is working for most people.  i have not had any problems and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to do a long cable run cheaply.

$review_text.: The Logitech TV Cam reminds me of the Cisco umi devise and service
 umi was a consumer focused webcam/video service introduced around 2009, and cancelled in 2012


 It aimed to allow users the convenience of a webcam but with better resolution and ease of use
 The cost was high-$600 for the hardware, $10/month (I think) for the service.Now, Logitech has the TV Cam, doing the same job for 1/3 the price of entry, and no monthly fees!I say "Dummy", as in...simple to set up, simple to use, easy to explain
 Great webcam for someone looking to set up a simple system without being tethered to a computer.Pros:-Easy set up-Easy use-Good quality picture and sound-Works without a computerCons:-The Skype used is a subset of the desktop software, missing some features and (in my view) the picture is not as good as when using desktop Skype-Since it is not attached to a PC, I do miss some of the integration features

$REVIEW.: For all the comfort and sound quality, these li'l buds have a short, short lifespan. Got a pair for Xmas--broken by February. Sent them in for replacement and the new pair arrived promptly. They lasted 2-3 months as well. Seeing a pattern, I just trashed them. Mid-June found me on my THIRD pair of these buds, and they croaked before the month was out. FWIW, I'm a pretty heavy user. I keep my MP3 player on me at all times and listen to it several times per day.The best feature--a woven cord as opposed to the standard plastic--may be the biggest problem. When the wires inside the cord get bent a lot, they fray, which causes the sound to cut in and out (or so I was told). These tiny wires cannot be replaced, so when they fray, you have to ditch the buds. Sure, the woven cord doesn't stick to itself like the plastic ones do, but I'll take a few tangles over two months of use. Wicked buds make even iPods sound good, but they're far too delicate.

$review_text.: I've always used the old-style headphones because I've always detested "ear buds"
The tone may be almost as good as the big cover-the-ear type, better than the compact 2" diameter cups, but you're forever poking at buds because they always feel like they're about to fall out


I had to replace my Sony noise-cancelling phones because the jack wore out, so I bought a pair of Klipsch Images
The ear cones that come with those weren't as bad as the buds that come with the player in terms of staying in, they help block outside noise, but it still wasn't enough of an improvement
I was still poking at one ear

So I bought these Comply TX 100s
They feel like they're going to stay in place a lot better than what I've been using

And better still, the bass is great

If you want a suggestion on whose work kicks butt on bass, try Marcus Miller

Particularly the title track on his "Tales" album
As somebody else here warned, I found I had to drop the volume 25-30% so as not to mess up my ears

It'll probably save battery drain on the player as well as a fringe benefit
Now I'll be finding out how they stand up over time.

Very impressed with the video quality, even after going to the WiFi mode.  Camera is very responsive and the two way audio feature is really neat.  I easily set up the remote viewing feature and the video quality is still great even though the response time for turning the camera is a couple seconds behind.  I can still live with it.

I use it on &#34;Easy Mode&#34; which is great


 I'm particular about my photos and I wanted a tiny camera that takes photos that I don't have to worry about (say, compared to more enthusiast cameras like the LX7 and RX100)


 However, this camera gives up just a bit too much functionality

 For example, the flash toggle only has &#34;auto&#34; and &#34;off.&#34;  There is no &#34;always on&#34; Flash which is disappointing, because I like to use flash with bright sunlight to fill in some of the shadows on people's faces.

The BIGGEST issue/drawback is that it will NOT accept a standard Arca plate
This means that if you use an Arca base on your mono for long glass you have to change out plates to use this

 If they were to modify the base by a few mm to allow for Arca size plates this would be a solid 4 - 4.5 stars.

$review_text.: I love this camera - that's the bottom line for me.  I'm taking a big step up from my first digital camera, the Nikon D40 which my husband wanted so he could start digital photography, and I could not be happier with my choice.However, I think it would be a waste of money for any one not familiar with the adjustments we used to routinely make with 35mm SLR film cameras.  The D7000 can certainly function as a fine point and shoot.  But why spend almost twice as much on this over the lighter D3100 if you just want to point and shoot, and maybe edit with PhotoShop or some such?For me, it's worth the difference because I want the freedom to quickly and easily make adjustments such as setting aperature or shutter speed to freeze or blur action; adjust the white balance on the fly for what I want the image to be; adjust the autofocus field and metering to suit the particular situation; switch from single shot to continuous, etc.  The D7000 puts all that in menus and sub-menus like the inexpensive Nikons, but it also puts it out right on the camera body, available through just one button and the turn of a wheel.Also, this ended up being just about as inexpensive for me as the D3100 because I would not have been satisfied with the kit lens on the D3100 - and replacing it would have been more expensive than using all the wonderful Nikon lenses I have left from the film days - WHICH NOW ALL WORK BEAUTIFULLY ON THE D7000.  (Of course, I did get my D7000 for $1,199, not the current prices.)  The inexpensive Nikons keep down weight and cost by not including a focusing motor in the camera - you have to rely on one in the lens.  The D7000, like other top of the line Nikons, includes its own focus motor.  Nice little bonus with the D7000 is its treatment of my old A1 lenses.  I have some optically very good, and very fast, A1s.  With the D7000, I can program it to recognize them - with just the push of a button and turn of the wheel again.  All I had to do was assign a lens number to each of the lenses and provide the focal length and maximum aperture.  Now I can use them with no trouble, I just have to focus them as always.  And the switch to go from autofocus to manual focus on the old lenses, or an autofocus lens that can't effectively autofocus in the particular situation (like my autofocus trying to pick up a tiny hummingbird in the middle of a rose bush this morning) is conveniently located by the side of the lens where my left hand would be going any way to grab the focus ring for manual focus.This is one really sweet camera.  It will do whatever you want.  The controls are easy and simple to understand if you have the background in photography - or want to learn.As I said, I think people are wasting their money if they buy this just because it is the new, hot camera when it is really more than they need.  But, if you want to be able to control the camera settings, and do it quickly without having to mess around with the camera, this is great.NOTE, after reading other reviews.  Nikon DSLRs have never had great video, and this doesn't seem to be an exception - if you want a video camera, get something else.  As for complaint about the manual, I think it goes back to my comments about needing to have some SLR experience or being willing to learn.  I found the manual completely understandable - it generally even explained each function a couple of times if you read all the way through the several hundred pages of manual.  Best way I've ever found to deal with this is sit down with the manual and the camera and really work my way through every setting, button, and dial so I know what I have.

$review_text.: Got this player because it has dual HDMI's out and 7.2 audio.  Teamed it with a Panasonic TCP65ST50 3D Plasma TV and an Onkyo 7.2 AV receiver that is not 3D capable.  The picture and audio are excellent.  The web interface is slower to connect than any of my other devices, Roku, old insignia BluRay and even the Panasonic TV.  Once its connected to the site it works fine then.  The swiping remote just doesn't work very well.  There is a delay after you swipe which makes it hard to tell if it actually registered the swipe.  It should have the arrows/center button options in addition to the swipe.  The Panasonic TV remote, Dish remote, my universal remote and my Iphone can all operate most of the functions on the BDT500.  I do recommend the BDT500 because I wanted the best picture and audio I could afford and I believe I have achieved that.  The web connection and remote issues are minor annoyances.  Also when teamed with a Panasonic TV it automatically optimizes the picture options, which I checked with a the WOW calibration disc.

 Most of the clear QAM cable channels it found were duplicates of other channels or simply info screens from Comcast about channel lineup changes


 I was really just hoping for the the same network HD channels I was currently getting


 Did this happen?  Well, yes and no

 Many of the channels were mislabeled by the EyeTV software
 One channel that was supposed to be channel 20-2, a PBS channel,  came up as BET, with all the wrong program info
 This also happened to several other channels.On my Toshiba TV, all the HD network channels come in and are identified as their "over the air"  counterparts


 NBC is 13.1, 13.2, 13.3; CBS is 18.1, 18.2


 etc..


 The EyeTV software had the channels located all over the place and identified with completely different channel numbers


Channel 13.1 was located at channel 1013, and Channel 18.1 was at channel 8
 I believe Comcast includes channel info encoded in their signal that my Toshiba can decode and then display the channels in order where they are supposed to be
 The EyeTV software did not do that with my Comcast subscription
 This was very confusing and ultimately was one of the two main reasons I returned the unit

 The other reason?  The remote control that comes with the USB stick was only useable from about 4 feet


 Even with the USB "exposed"(which is difficult to do when the unit is behind your TV) the remote was not useable from any of the seating positions in my room
 Yes, the Apple remote will work but cannot control many of the DVR qualities of the USB stick and software.Picture quality was very good, but not as good as the Comcast signal straight into my TV
 There were occasional lags in live TV, and also with the recordings I tried
 The EyeTV Hybrid may work well for most folks- I suspect the channel issue is a Comcast one

 I just didn't have the patience to get used to using the Apple remote or a keyboard or a keyboard app on my iPad


 Still too old school I guess
 My wife, who is fairly technically capable would have had a hard time with the system using the Apple remote


 Too many screens to go through just to record a program or look at the guide

 The EyeTV remote allows you to jump right to those options, but again was only useable about 4 feet away with direct line of sight to the USB stick

 I plan to stick with satellite TV and my basic cable subscription (discounted because I also get Internet thru Comcast) for the time being

 My plan was to drop satellite and use the EyeTV and software to DVR just the networks via cable, and then subscribe to Netflix and HuluPlus


 This experiment will have to wait for another day I guess.Elgato EyeTV Hybrid TV Tuner Special Edition Version (Includes 2 years of TV Guide Data valued at $39.90) - 10021030

$REVIEW.: The long awaited Olympus 750 is the latest in a line of excellent relatively compact, long lens models. The last model, the 740, was a stop-gap measure that allowed the company to position a new model in the line while they worked out the kinks in the 750's updated autofocus system. The result was worth waiting for, as a much faster system now exists that allows the camera to take better advantage of low light and fast action scenes.In addition, the 750 addresses another of the 740's drawbacks, the lack of sound on the occasionally very useful movie feature has been fixed. Many users will also be pleased to note that finally they have upped the maximum resolution from 3 to 4 megs.Still troublesome however is the lack of stabilization, making long range zoom shots very tricky. In point of fact, zooming on any camera at 10X without a tripod or image stabilization is extremely challenging.Anyway, this camera is beautifully made and ergonomically engineered. The aspherical all glass lens system is excellent and the resulting 4 megapixel images are crystal clear at 11&quot; x 14&quot; and beyond. The zoom of course remains the trump card on the 750, and the smoothness (just the right damping) with which it reaches its 10x limit is awesome.The 750 (a feature that began with the 730) is the third Olympus to utilize the new xD memory card format, the &quot;xD-Picture Card&quot;. This is a new type of ultra-compact memory media developed jointly by Fuji and Olympus. The main features of the xD-Picture Card are its ultra-compact size (20.0 x 25.0 x 1.7mm), its lower power consumption (the xD Picture-Card users will benefit from the convenience and savings of longer battery life on a single charge) and its faster read/write speeds. Of course, a new card means a new card-reader will be needed, but these are inexpensive and aren't immediately needed, as the camera can be linked by the included USB cable to your PC without too much fuss.Overall, I think the 750 is the Olympus most users have been waiting for, sans stabilization. Whether that system (present on my Olympus 2100 &amp; far from perfect) is in the works on a 760 model I cannot say, but if you're in the market for a relatively compact digicam with a very long zoom, you can hardly go wrong with any of the 700 series by Olympus.

$REVIEW.: This is by far the best camera bag that I have ever owned! Very roomy with plenty of room to hold all my lenses, tapes, batteries, and other miscellaneous gear. With my old "16x9" camera bag I had to dismount my 12" shotgun mike from my camera every time I wanted to put my camera back into it's case because the mic kept on hitting the case and wouldn't fit while still attached to my camera. That's a problem I'll never have to worry about with my new Magnum DV 4000 AW Shoulder Bag! I can fit my camera and my shotgun mike into the bag without having to disconnect my shotgun mike from my camera! Yipee!!!Another great feature which I love about this bag is that it has almost endless room for expansion! The Lowepro Magnum DV 4000 AW Shoulder Bag can hold whatever camera accessories you may ever desire to carry with you during a video shoot and like some reviewers have mentioned, you can even use this bag for occasions other than video. Like a rugged travel bag for caring laptops, computer parts, hard drives, practically anything you can think of that requires rugged protection from the elements WITHOUT BROADCASTING TO POTENTIAL THIEVES THAT THIS BAG CONTAINS EXPENSIVE CAMERA GEAR!PRO's: RoomyVery Comfortable to carryMany Compartments for storageRain Guard/CoverRugged ConstructionStylish DesignAdjustable Partitions!Con's: NONE!!!

$review_text.: I waited for 20 days for this thing to get delivered and I only ordered it because of the solid reviews and the cost per watts was unbeatable. I was excited to recieve this fancy PSU, in fact it looks bad ass, the cables are built solid with insulation. Includes 6 VGA cables, great for mining and a IRRC 6 molex, 6 or 9 sata, 2 cpu.Long story short I finished loading linux and had to leave so I shut down my computer and returned an hour later and it would not boot so I pulled the power cable from the back of the PSU thinking I would let the residual power drain before trying to restart, upon pluging it into the back of the PSU there was small electrical spark, almost like static and I saw this from my peripheral vision so i''m not sure if it happened where I plugged it in or inside the enclosure however it rendered the PSU dead. I got it tested and a computer shop and they concurred.This PSU is currently backordered so if I wanted another I would have to wait a month for Amazon to restock. I called EVGA and they approved an Advance RMA, meaning I gave them my CC number for collateral and they are going to ship out my replacement unit immediately so I'm out a PSU for 3 days until it comes. As for as EVGA customer support, they were extremely friendly, accomodating and helpful. They informed me they are new to the PSU market and apologize for this issue and want to make this right, they sounded sincere and hopefully this is an isolated incident. I will try to update in a few months hopefully with positive reviews otherwise i'm returning and going with a corsair.

$review_text.: I got two of these about a month ago and followed the instructions regarding charging for 10 hours the first time, even though the green light on my charger came on after about two. Several charge/discharge cycles later, I shot 2600+ images yesterday at a marching band competition before changing the battery when the indicator on my Canon Rebel XTi dropped to one bar. (Most were shot in burst mode. None with flash. I started about 4:30 pm and ended after 10:00 pm so about half were daylight/dusk and half were stadium lights only. The only time my display is on is when I am setting, changing or checking settings, otherwise it is turned off.) This exceeds the performance I have been getting out of the OEM battery supplied with the camera and at less than 1/4 the price is a great value. We'll see how they compare to the Canon battery in terms of total charge/recharge cycles.A year later and of the two I bought together one is still going just as strong as the OEM battery that came with my camera, the other will only charge up to about 1/4 strength before the charger thinks it is full. Even leaving it attached to the charger several more hours makes no difference. Off the charger the camera battery indicator only shows one bar. It is still usable as a last resort if I drain the other two, but doesn't last very long.

$REVIEW.: I love this keyboard. The feel and look of it, the speed of my typing across its shallow keys, the soft illumination that whispers "yes, I'm here". After receiving it for Christmas last year, I quickly purchased another for work.Yet my first keyboard began having problems. I tend to type a lot, and I enjoy gaming, so some keys see more use than others. For example, the space bar. I noticed a 'squeek' in my space bar after prolonged use; after a while it became quite regular, and soon downright annoying. If I had wanted this awkward, constant squeeking, I would consider moving back in with my old college roommate.A quick hop online with a Logitech CS member gave me an RMA; they would immediately ship out a replacement, and provided me a prepaid label to return my own.For a while, the new one worked fine. It lasted much longer, several months even. (My work one had no work problems- even up to today)However, just last week I noticed the Ctrl button began making clanging noise. Very metallic, very noisy. Pressing on it a certain way would allow the key to function quietly like normal, but a few taps the wrong way would make it clank again. Also, the awkward squeek began to emerge. I've little doubt that in a few weeks it will grow worse.Unfortunately, as I have already RMA'd the first keyboard, the replacement keyboard is no longer covered by any warranty. I will contact Logitech about this matter, but I don't expect them to do anything about it. And I don't expect them to, either.I fully support purchasing from Logitech; their products are aesthetically pleasing, affordable, and backed by great customer support. And in general, their products are spot on- I have owned four keyboards, several gaming controllers and a plethora of their mice. With the exception of this keyboard, all have been working without any problems.EDIT 10/10/11Logitech has agreed to replace my second keyboard again. Just provided the UPS return label. They did not respond to my question about getting just a refund though. Good enough I suppose.

And unless you are still using a CRT or a very small flat panel this won't really fit underneath.

$REVIEW.: I've set up all kinds of routers from many different manufacturers.  I personally use Linksys and Netgear routers, but a neighbor bought this unit and asked his tech friend to help set up their wireless network.  After agreeing to a beer and nachos as payment, I got started.Easiest setup ever. It's all ready to plug into the wall and your wired internet connection, and even comes with a preset SSID (Wireless network name) and WPA2 Password (Standard encrypted security.)  Unless you like to hide your SSID (most people don't, I do.) you're basically ready to go, even without using the included setup disc!  Took maybe 5 minutes tops:1) Plug your internet ethernet cable into the Belkin router. (Clearly indicated)2) Plug the Belkin router's power cable into an electrical socket. The ONE light on top turns green when it's detected an internet connection and is broadcasting.3) See the included label.  It has your preset SSID (Network name) and password.  On your wireless device, just look for the matching network, and type in the provided password! Done.You don't need to use the setup CD unless you can't figure that last part out.4) Enjoy free beer and nachos for doing something that was really easy.*I'm giving it four stars, because while the setup CD is helpful, it installs a Belkin Wireless Manager program on your PC or Mac, which seems not to work if you change the preset SSID or password.  TIP:  If you're connected to the Belkin's wireless network, to make changes to your router and network settings, you can type in the word 'router' in any internet browser to access the Belkin's control panel, WITHOUT the setup CD.Using for: Casual internet browsing, online streaming video like Youtube and Hulu. Also performed well for Nintendo Wii online gaming. (Smash Bros)

$review_text.: Several years ago, in an effort to economize, we decided to switch from "regular" batteries to rechargeable batteries
This meant that every couple of weeks, invariably in the middle of an important project, my mouse would suddenly balk -- and quit
Off I'd go to the recharge station, hoping that whoever'd come before me had replaced the freshly charged batteries with empties, and that said empties had been in there long enough to recharge

More than once, they hadn't


Grrr


And more than once, those in the charger had overheated, leading me to make a quick visual scan to spot the closest fire exit

I'm happy to say those days are over

These batteries work as they should ("Like gangbusters," Dad would have said), last forever (well, maybe not quite forever), and are well worth their cost
No more mid-project breakdowns, and no more worrying about burning the place down
For me, that's a bargain that's hard to beat.

$REVIEW.: After a bit of tweaking this has become a great monitor for the dollar

The colors are vibrant and accurate and the contrast is fantastic.Note that the black level isn't stellar -- it's pretty typical of TN panels (from my understanding), so professional photo editing wouldn't be recommended on this thing

However, for basic editing and every day use it works just fine (and HDMI input is nice too!)


I'm a multimedia designer and developer and I use this every day

I just double check on my second, more expensive monitor for black levels and other nit-picky stuff before finalizing an image.Also note that this panel is 1920x1080..
NOT 1920 x 1200 like "standard" 24" monitors
You miss 120 pixels but it's not going to kill you :)



$review_summary.: Great contrast & color, so-so black level, so-so screen uniformity.

$review_text.: This is a great inexpensive GPS.  The touch screen is clear even in daytime.  The interface is great and  very easy to use. Wife, who hates reading manuals is very happy with it.  During the night, it automatically switch to nightmode which is very important so as not to distract you while you drive.  Nightmode is less bright by turning the color to a dark background.  Audio is very easy to understand.  It tells you in advance when you are about to turn.  At the top, it tells you the street you are in and the next street you will need to turn.  Once you start the car, sattelite connection speed is pretty decent.  The screen is large enough for visual.  There is a built-in rechargeable battery with the unit which last for several hours.  But ideally, the unit should be used plugged-in with the included cigarette lighter adapter.  This senses when you start the car and automatically turns on the GPS which at the same time starts charging the internal battery.  The GPS can also be charged through the included UBS cable through a computer.We own this for a couple of years now.  It was purchase at that time for 299$.  Purchased a 2nd one, a refurbished unit for 199$.  Both are still working.Rooms for Improvement:-There is a small round plastic with adhesive at the bottom to stick to the dashboard where you press the suction cup; or you can stick the suction cup directly to the windshield.  Either way, the suction cup will fail and the GPS might fall or slide off your dashboard.  Could be dangerous when it happens when you are driving.It is much better to get the accessory where you put the GPS on top of the dashboard instead of using the suction cup that comes with the unit.  This accessory is not cheap though - around 39$ at the of this review.-Can be made smaller in size
$review_summary.: Great and Very Practical GPS

$REVIEW.: Just to get this out right away this case fits perfectly fine with the iPad mini WITHOUT retina.Been looking for a folio style case that has a secure locking closure and came upon this case. I wanted the prior version of this model but the opened back shell bothered me so I held off. When I saw they had an updated version where the entire back was covered I right away bought this case.The iPad fits perfectly fine in the case. Access to the head jack and lightning port are big enough for 3rd party cords. The power button, slider and volume rockers are easily accessible without difficulty. The case essentially has 5 viewing angles. The grooves hold well and doesn't budge. The addition of a sturdy typing angle was a plus even though I rarely use my iPad to type. Your device is fully covered when closed and the cover is secure due to the clasp; which is great when you put it in a bag or something. You can clasp the cover backwards so you can hold your iPad which is also a plus in my books because most folio cases the flap is sliding and moving around. The back shell and flap of the case is covered by a soft material so no harm is done to your device. Around the speakers seems to be a small cupping shape to help sound quality. It's not an extreme difference but I did notice louder sounds. (It's similar as using your hand to cup the speakers to have the volume beam to you, sounds confusing) There's a bit of weight added but the iPad mini is already light. The little addition of weight is fine with me because it gives me the conscious that I'm holding my iPad and not a light folder.  aI don't understand why some are bashing it because it doesn't have the magnetic on/off feature. If all you're looking for is that feature there are PLENTY of cases that have it. Don't ruin the rep of this case. Personally I like it without that feature because I'll know if my iPad's on or off.But seeing that this case has a very secure closure I can see why people would want this feature. But regardless this is 5 stars.Overall I love this product. And I recommend!
$SUMMARY.: Perfect case. I don't know why people are knocking this case down due to magnetic on/off features.

For my medium-large hands, the cover makes the Paperwhite much more comfortable to hold. The cover appears to be good quality and is certainly more attractive than the Kindle cover with the built-in light that I got for my older Kindle.In all, I am very pleased with the cover. It makes the Paperwhite more portable and useful for me, while it properly protects it.

$REVIEW.: My wireless mouse that I lugged around with my laptop had problems that new batteries would not solve. I resolved to buy a corded mouse instead, since the touchpads on all but the highest end systems are utter crap.What I needed was a simple corded mouse that had the basic features of 1. pointing and 2. clicking. I don't need fancy management software, programmable buttons, etc. I just need to point and click. This mouse works great. Plus at this price point if it gets crushed in my laptop bag, it's not like a wasted $100 on an ultra super mega mouse with 8 programmable buttons and 12 sensors for precise movement or whatever.If you need a fancy mouse, look elsewhere. If you need basic mouse functionality at a price where it doesn't matter if your toddler uses it as a teething ring, it is perfect.

$REVIEW.: I preordered both the Touch and the case in Brown.  The Touch arrived last week, and I have a very favorable opinion (a big step up from my Kindle 3).The case finally arrived today, and it needs to go back.  The electrical contacts where the case connects to the Touch were not sufficiently exposed, which caused the light to only function when pressing down on the bezel by the home button.  If I let up on the pressure, the light would go off.Clearly this is not how it is supposed to work -- and it is certainly not a "feature..."  I used a pair of tweezers to pry up the contact points by 0.5mm or so, and now the light is working as expected.  The light is actually a big improvement over the Kindle 3 case's built-in light, providing much more even lighting across the entire screen.  The lighting also seems less harsh and doesn't seem to waste light in all directions.  Thumbs up for the light!The front cover, on the other hand, seems both thin and inferior to the back cover of the case, which provides sufficient heft and protection.I also agree with other reviewers that there should be a way to secure the front cover.  It simply "rests" on top of the Touch in a closed position and will readily flap around.  It seems like the designers were envisioning the iPad SmartCover, except that this one is neither magnetic nor smart.Finally, I also must say that is is very difficult to remove the device from the case.  It almost feels like you're bending the case (or the Kindle) to near the breaking point to get the unit out.Bottom line:  nice idea and very good light (when it works), but the overall execution leaves something to be desired.

I'm a WoW addict (/cry) and needed a mic for Vent.  This mic works perfectly for me in Vista32.  I renamed the device in setup so it stood out when I was selecting my input device in WoW and Vent.

$review_text.: I tried to like this case.  The quality is good, and I really liked the material it's made of.  It's very grippy, so no worries about my iPad Mini slipping out of my hand.  My displeasure with the case comes from the stand mechanism.  It works great in the viewing mode, and the angle for typing on the on-screen keyboard is perfect, if it would only not fall over every time it is moved the least little bit.  In typing mode, the triangle comes unfolded way too easy, and I was constantly having to readjust it.  After one business trip, I put my iPad back into my other case.  Too bad, because the case was great in other ways...my search for the perfect combination of protection, slim profile, and functionality in an iPad Mini case continues...

$REVIEW.: I am very pleased with this cover for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1.The tablet simply snaps into place and is held very securely; no slipping likereviews of other cases have mentioned.If it's propped up on a non-slippery surface, you can view the screen at many different angles (in landscape position).  It also allows you to fit the flap into a groove for one particular incline, which may be good for typing with the large, virtual keyboard.  I just use Swype.When I removed the adhesive label on the cover which showed how to use the flap, a sticky residue remained.  I got rid of this by simply wiping with rubbing alcohol.This cover was more costly than many others, but it's worth it.

$REVIEW.: I have had bunches of GPS units, and tons of Bluetooth devices.  Unfortunately, Garmin seems destined and determined to be at the pure bottom of the barrel when it comes to Bluetooth implementations.  Simply stated, I have attempted to configure both an iPhone 4, and a Samsung Galaxy S4 with this device, using two different bluetooth headsets.  In all cases, no matter what is tried, the issue is that while the devices all seem to pair perfectly fine, calls coming in result in zero sound of any type or zero microphone capability via the Garmin.  If you physically switch the phone handset during the call to speaker, and then back to bluetooth, then the sound comes through appropriately.  All the devices individually work correctly if the Garmin is not involved.  Garmin support is, well, nonexistent.  Garmin really is great for base GPS functionality, though their recent decisions to remove zip code search from many of their product line defies logic.  However, as with the Zumo 550, the 665 is simply a brick concerning industry standard bluetooth compatibility.  It is truly unfortunate that Garmin cripples an otherwise good unit withe same poorly engineered comm setup, making the 665 vastly overpriced.  I plan to return this unit as soon as I can verify a few final details with Garmin, assuming I can ever really get in touch with them.  For the price, this unit is simply not recommended.  I am terribly disappointed in Garmin.
$SUMMARY.: GPS functions OK.  Bluetooth is wothless - completely and totally worthless.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this lens recently. I was  hemming and hawing debating if I need another 50 mm lens up until the moment I took out my credit card and bought it. I already have a Leica M9 and a Summicron 50 mm F2. On a sunny day, outside shots the Nokton it is a very good lens but the Summicron delivers superior results in my opinion. The margin is noticeable but not as large as you think it would be given the relative costs of each lens.The place where the Nokton excels and proves it worth is in settings where you can't or don't want to use a flash and you want to keep the ISO lower than 800. I used it both at a birthday party shooting inside shots and at the usually mostly dark American Museum of Natural History in NYC. The ISO for most shots was at 400 and I can still hand hold steady at 1/15 sec. If I used the Summicron the ISO would have to have been at 800 which isn't terrible but in the M9 the noise does noticeably degrade image quality.It is a heavy, large and solid piece of glass. I found that using the Leica handgrip plate and the Thumbs Up thumb rest permitted me to hold the camera steadily and comfortably. I'd also recommend a very comfortable neck strap. I'm using a modded neoprene strap. After switching it out for the Summicron the difference was immediately noticeable. Yet, I didn't get a lot of stares from people as I would from my Nikon D700 or D2x. It may even disguise your M9 to look like one of the other mirrorless digitals. I had already owned the handgrip and the Thumbs Up to help me reduce camera shake and were not purchased specifically for this lens .It focuses smoothly, well and easily. At f/1.1 the depth of field is relatively razor thin but will permit you to isolate subjects almost magically - see the review of the lens on Luminous Landscape for examples. If you weren't too close you could get good shots of people at f/1.1 just make sure in taking sets of people they are all lined up in the same depth of field.There is also probably a use which I have haven't tested yet but for wide field astrophotography. Keep in mind the M9 will only permit you to keep the shutter open for a maximum of 2 minutes and 30 seconds to prevent the sensor from becoming toasted.The other mechanical aspects of the lens are solid, well built and quality.The Bokeh is watercolor like and I happen to like it a great deal.I think the best use for this lens is for museums, parties and other social events where there is very low available light.

Until we got this, our only option was stringing cables and wires from one area of the house to another and even then the connections wouldn't work all that well. This solved the issue and everything we tested would connect just fine to extend our high speed network - using only a power outlet! We tested an extra computer, Blu-ray player, etc.It is basically plug and play, although we followed the instructions to tweak it for better reception. None of this was hard. Very user friendly.

$review_text.: I've never been one to go too cheap when it comes to mice, but for the past few years, I just haven't been able to find something that I liked as much as my Logitech MX510 (or original Intellimouse Explorer, before that). I'd look at the stores a couple of times a year, try one out every now and then, and eventually switch back to the MX510.Similarly, I've never found a wireless mouse I've liked. The response was never quite as crisp as having a "real" wired mouse, or they'd do funky things like need to be re-paired in the middle of something, or when it came to Bluetooth mice, they'd go through batteries like mad.Logitech has created the perfect wireless mouse. Hands down. I'm seriously in awe of the Performance Mouse MX.The ergonomic feel is perfect. It has a nice substantial feel without being too wide, or too narrow. The rise in the center has the most natural feel I've ever had with a mouse. The quality of the materials only adds to the experience.I'm using this mouse on a Mac running Snow Leopard, and getting it set up was as simple as plugging it in. I had already installed the Logitech software from my MX510, so it immediately recognized the Performance Mouse (which was also partially charged out of the box). As I was getting the settings adjusted, I noticed the switch that changes the scroll wheel from a standard ratchet-type wheel to a gliding wheel. And once I started using it, I knew I'd never go back. The bottom thumb button was automatically mapped to Expos&eacute;, and I've started really using Expos&eacute; as a result.I noticed another reviewer had a problem with Adobe CS4 on a Mac, but I haven't experienced any problems at all.As for tracking, the Performance Mouse is brilliant. It really will track on anything, and the response has no perceptible lag at all. And my last typical strike against wireless mice -- needing to have extra batteries on-hand -- is completely taken care of. Plug in the included micro-USB cable, and it's just like a wired mouse. Logitech has even thought out the design here to make the cable look, feel, and move like any wired mouse.Logitech also includes an unusually nice carrying bag for cables and the AC adapter. I thought this was a bit over the top initially, but now that I'm thinking about taking the mouse with me when I'm at work, it's a very thoughtful inclusion.For the price, you absolutely get what you pay for. The only negative thing I can think of is that I didn't grab one of these the day they hit the shelves.

$review_text.: I recently bought a Panasonic Lumix FX01 after a long camera search.  I planned to keep it in my pocket most of the time, so I thought that I'd better guard the screen by getting some of these protectors.  They would have been relatively easy to cut and put on except they aren't premeasured to fit 2.5" screens.  That's a bummer--every camera I looked at had  a screen at least this big.  So I had to measure it myself.  (Also, I had to waste the rest of the sheet, which should have had enough room left to make 3 more covers.)  Once I put it on the camera I was kind of disappointed.  The Lumix has a beautiful display, but with a plastic protector stuck on it it just looked a lot less amazing.  It wasn't harder to see or anything, just less appealing.Anyway, after a few weeks of use I had to remove the protector.  The corner started peeling up and of course couldn't be stuck down again.  I'm not willing to hand measure and cut one of these things every month, so I guess I won't be using them anymore.

My husband and I are having a baby in a week (eek!) and although we have a pro-sumer high-end digital camera for his use, I wanted something small to throw in the diaper bag and carry around easily to replace our older (small) camera.  Anyway, although hesitant about the battery based on all of the reviews, we decided to go with this model.I updated the firmware which supposedly fixes the battery issue and want to offer this tip: the memory card wasn't letting me copy the firmware update onto it for transfer to the camera using my Mac OS.  (That line may only make sense once you go to the Cannon site and follow their directions for updating.)  It took me a while going through tips online and find the solution: basically, some Macs have issues with the unlocked memory card so you need to move the Lock/Unlock tab on the card to the MIDDLE position and that somehow tricks the computer and solves the problem.  So, if you find yourself dealing with this same issue then move the tab and you shouldn't have any additional problems--I didn't!The quality of the photos seemed excellent (though we had it less than 24 hours)--the tracking was good, the photos were good, the low-light images were good.  However, it was extremely bulkier than anticipated.  The size and weight seems a lot different in the abstract online (and even seeing the camera in person at a local store) than it does when it's in your hands at home.  I felt like it would always be a chore to take the camera along when my main goal had been to get something small, small, small with good quality.  Plus, I remained concerned about how 100% of the professional reviews referred to a terrible battery life and didn't want to wind up out with our new baby and unable to take photos--the entire point of ordering this camera!We returned this and wound up ordering the Canon Elph 300 HS instead since it also has excellent reviews--I sincerely hope we didn't make a mistake but the size was the biggest deal-breaker in the end.
$SUMMARY.: A lot bigger than anticipated, concerned about the battery giving out on me

$REVIEW.: The set up of the Logitech 750e was very easy as long as you follow the basic steps and dont try to skip anything. It was pretty much plug and play setup and It included the inline Ethernet adapters so all you had to do was plug one into a wall socket near your router, plug it into the router, plug to other adapter into a wall socket someplace around where you would want surveillance, then plug the camera in.Put the setup disk in computer and install the desktop software. During this setup process it searches for your camera(s) on your network network, then you can see what your cameras see so you can adjust as needed.The camera itself is of very good quality and the field of view is wide. Each camera comes with a microSD card preinstalled so you don't have to save video to your computer. Yes you can save all video to your hard drive if you want.Everything was extremely easy to set up, (note) but as networks tend to be temperamental dont unplug anything while powered up unless you want to reboot everything to get the cameras back up.

$review_text.: The short radius does not extend far enough to reach the outside of the recess in back of the TV making these pretty much worthless.  Instead, I ordered the 360 degree swiveling adapter and that worked great. My need was for connecting a Google Chrome device on a TV mounted to the wall.  The product may work better for other purposes, but failed at satisfying my need.

I didn't even open the manual, and I'm no computer geek.  Making connection with my WiFi network was a two minute affair, and I found all the stations I was looking for in a few minutes.

$REVIEW.: There are lots of bluetooth headphones out there, but few that have NFC capability. NFC makes the initial pairing so much easier, but it also makes using the headphones with multiple devices much easier. Without NFC, you often need to search for which device it was last connected to, disconnect it, then reconnect it to the device you want. With NFC, you simply tap and it switches over, and it can also automatically turn the bluetooth radio on if needed. Tapping again will disconnect, turn off the bluetooth radio (if it was off when connecting).The bluetooth connection and NFC worked perfectly, paired up instantly and audio streamed without a hitch. Would be nice to have a wired jack, just as an option or if the battery dies.For the price, I am quite happy with the product so far. These headphones are not going to be audiophile quality, but they sound just fine to me for casual use. The earpads are foam, which let your ears breathe, and they also do not seal out outside noise, which may be a good or bad thing depending on how you want to use these.My main concern was the durability of the unit, but it seems fine so far. The folding hinge is made of metal, which looks like it will be durable and much better than if it was plastic. There is a ribbon cable at the hinge, but the way it was made, it looks like there is not much stress on it, so hopefully that will hold up well. The hinge when folded does expose the ribbon cable and the internals of the hinge, so I'd be wary of debris getting in there when throwing it in a bag. Wish it would have come with some sort of case or pouch.I have not tested the battery life. Charging is easy with any standard micro usb charger.There is a microphone which is embedded in one of the earpieces. I don't intend on using this too much, but I tested it with a call and it works OK. It sounds somewhat like you're speaking on a speakerphone, kind of like you're slightly too far from the mic, but it's not too bad and no one had any problems hearing me speak.The buttons are a little tight, requiring you to press a little hard to register and they make a bit of click sound, but that is a minor gripe.So far, so good, will report if anything ends up breaking or going wrong with these. For $35, this was a great deal.Update:6 months later, have run into serious problems with these headphones and am changing my rating to 1 star. One, the battery no longer holds a charge, it only works when attached to a USB charger. Secondly, only the right side has sound, the left no longer works. Between these two issues, the headphones are now useless. The headphones were only used lightly and never transported or bumped around. They were kept in my living room for occasional listening. Some of the other reviews have mentioned similar issues, leading me to believe this isn't just an isolated incident. When they did work, I was pretty happy with them for the price.

$REVIEW.: This camera cannot double as a baby monitor because the audio is essentially non-existent. That said, even as a surveillance camera it may not be the best option due to these pros and cons:+ Affordable (much cheaper than the Foscam)+ Great features (e.g. pan/tilt/night vision)- Quality (first unit was DOA)- Ease of Installation (the instruction manual is terrible; I could only hook up normal in-network viewing, not via the internet)- Miniscule Audio (as noted above)If you're willing to put up with the lack of audio and the difficult installation, TENVIS is willing to pay you $15 for you to buy the camera and give it a 5-star review here on Amazon (no wonder this thing is so highly rated despite it being a terrible product).I ultimately bought an Infant Optics 2.4GHz baby monitor. No need to lose even more sleep than what the baby is already causing me.

$review_text.: My Samsung tablet came with charger. Albeit a very short one. It's pretty much useless if you want to use the tablet as it charges. Sounds like no big real. For me, I like to often use my tablet from bed. Sometimes to watch a movie. The charger is needed then for example.  I looked for a longer one and Amazon came through again.  This six plus foot long charger cable fills the bill perfectly. And the price was low enough to justify the purchase.

I don't see why that would be a problem seeing as how it comes with a remote control but to each their own.  I have had it for a couple of weeks and it is a definite improvement over the 1500 model. For the price it is a good deal.  It is especially good if you own a Samsung TV since they have the Anynet+ connection.

$REVIEW.: The adapter works better than I expected, given that there were a few bad reviews,i.e


the adapters failed to operate when connected as some reviews indicated.Actually, the adapter works well displaying all types of videos whetherstored on my iPad (iOS 4.3) or being viewed directly online from a website.With the early iPad, as some have also indicated, there's no "mirroring" capability,but that does not greatly limit this adapter's overall utility


When comparedto my Blackberry Playbook with direct HDMI output and "mirroring", the iPad mayproduce an occasion jerkiness in displaying the video, but that's most likelythe result of the early iPad, e.g
single processor, and not the adapter.So, based on my experience, this adapter is a very useful accessory for the iPadand any problems working with an iPad should not be related to the design northe functionality of the adapter.

$REVIEW.: I've been using this for a few months now as I got tired of losing my phone connection every time time the power flickered.  I also wanted to be able to use my phone for an hour or two after the power went out (I have a big UPS on my home network).  The light on top is handy if you're working on the computer at night.  We have some power failures almost monthly and it's worked fine through all of them.The only really annoying part was installation.  The adapters it came with are not all that universal.  I could not plug it in to my Panasonic one since the plastic surrounding the metal part of the connector would not allow mt to insert it all the way in.  A sharp knife and some trimming resolved that and it's been working fine.  Not a perfect fit, but no problems after several months now.  Just need a better design on their adapters to make them more universal.  It also did not match the voltage precisely, but the next step up has been fine for my Panasonic phones.

$review_text.: I messed up, and didn't read the reviews here before I bought this junker.On the good side, it is really easy to setup.  Also, my Harmony recognized it right off, so the remote works perfectly.  Thanks Logitech!Other than that, this device is crippled out of the box.  All it can do, is play MP3 and AVI files.  Anything else you want to do requires a plug-in.  Now, you may be thinking, most media players and web browsers need plug-ins.  True, but they're usually free.  Not the Archos plug-ins. They're $26-$40 (prices are in Euros 20-30e)each.  All-in-all it's about $120 worth of plug-ins.Even the web browser itself is a plug-in.  That's right, no web browser included...that's another $40 (30e). c'mon!  BTW: It's Opera. Why am I paying for Opera?No Winamp support either, thanks Shoutcast for (finally) creating your own, in-browser, player. Now I can play Shoutcast, with my $40 web browser.There are plenty of other media extenders on the market, that do not need additional, expensive add-ons. If that's what you're looking for, get one of them, not this.  They may not record TV, but this one doesn't either, without a subscription to the TV Program Guide (another $26 - not counted in the plug-ins).The Archos TV+ is a just a hole in your media center, for you to throw money into.

$review_text.: First off, it says on the back of the box "This product is not a toy and is not intended for children under 9 years of age"......However I ordered them for our 3 year old who, without details is quite advanced for her age, for use while listening to her ipod, laptop or dvd player in the car. So spare me the "bad parent" sermon and keep reading for a review on the headphones....We didn't want a pair that only allows minimal sound like most children headphones...due to the fact that any I have purchased prior didn't block out other noise and therefore were not loud enough to hear. She knows how to adjust volumes to decent levels which having the volume control on these Jack Skellington headphones were a plus for us and adjust nicely. I tested the sound quality on them with a range of different music genres and have to say they are pretty decent. Not nearly as good as my Crossfade Vmoda's but definitely better than my husband's $50 Subjekt's. The construction of the headphones aren't anything to do cartwheels over other than the design on them are cute especially if your child or yourself adore "Jack." They are made of plastic and like anything made of plastic could snap in half if not cared for properly. Moving on, they are wide on the headband part more than most children or adult bands I've seen which was REALLY odd to me at first but daughter seems to appreciate the fact that they don't painfully pin back/down her ears BUT because they are wider, they slip back and forth easily depending on how hard our daughter is rocking out with her music. And no she doesn't have an abnormally large head for you comedians out there....Anyway,she hasn't complained about how annoying it is that they fall off from time to time so I'm assuming it's not too bad of an issue. Both sides of the band adjust for length. They kind of snap into "8 leveled" grooves. Our pair easily  snaps into each level and stays there but I can see how in time could freely slip out of the groove. The gray ear cup cushions are decent and comfortable especially with the wide headband. However I could see the material on the cushion, if snagged, tear easily...Feels somewhat thin to me. The headband is averagely padded...nothing to boast about really however they are better than a straight plastic or metal band. The cord is quite long and is thicker than most cords in this price range. The connection point of the cord to the headphones is sturdy and seems pretty durable and intact.Overall, truly reasonable for $24.99....least for us and our daughter loves them...to each their own. Hope this helps someone!

In that lens the filter starts to feel a bit thick, which is not the case in larger lenses like the 77mm version of it in a Canon 24-105 F4L or a Canon 100mm f2.8L. If you are seeking a filter for a compact lens you may wish to look for a thinner filter, like the B+W XS-Pro filter line.

$REVIEW.: I couldnt wait to upgrade to the fire HD. The device was impressive: quality screen, fast wifi, HMDI port...The main problem is the lack of customization. The navigation bar cannot be edited and it now spans two screens instead of the one on the kindle fire.When you turn the device on you get movie ads. super annoying.When you are in your carousel and hover over a book, you see ads (customers also bought) and when you hover over a website you get (trending now). I thought these would be ok but they are very intrusive. they move and seriously clutter the screen in portrait mode. The kindle fire OS was so clean and organzied now it is cluttered and ugly. Tech support says there is no way to turn these off so reluctantly I am returning this which is sad because the hardware is amazing!Why cant they let us pay to turn these off? I dont mind ads when i am shopping but not when I am just browsing my own device.The fire was supposed to be a multimedia device not a cluttered ad. Worse than watching tv with commercials. Booo amazon. I have been a kindle fan for years but I am guessing I will never buy one again with this new focus.

$REVIEW.: We got the Logitech to put in our bedroom.  We mainly use it for a couple of nano 6G's.  This speaker works fine and sounds great (I acknowledge that my ears aren't the best).  So why not 5 stars?1.  There's no dedicated adapter for the nano 6G.  You actually use the one for a larger iPod (classic).  The nano snaps in fine, but I feel that if I press on the nano's screen too hard, that I'd break the dock connector.2.  The remote works well, although I think it's designed more for a click-wheel iPod.  You can go back through the menu on the touch based nano, but not forward.  So navigating the nano requires touching the screen, which leads to problem number 1.Those are the only 2 issues for me.  I suppose if I were using it for a click iPod, it would be perfect.  We have an older Logitech speaker and it has the same issues when used for the nano.  However, we got that one for the iPod mini.  The remote in the new Logitech is much much much better than the one from the old Logitech.ft

$REVIEW.: It's basically like a giant folder to put electronics in. I've packed this thing with at least 50 pounds of gear and literally traveled half way around the world with it. I did start to pop a few seams on the shoulder straps, but since have been a bit more careful and I might take it to a seamstress to have the edges reinforced. That being said, besides a backpackers pack, I don't think you will find a much heavier duty bag. I would have broken a dozen normal backpacks in the time it took to pop a few seams on this one.Pros:-Heavy duty, fits very large laptops and similar shaped stuff.Cons:-Given the huge physical dimensions of the bag, it fits a surprisingly small amount of clothes, misc. items, or really anything that isn't relatively flat.-My laptop has suffered a little damage, but I wouldn't consider the amount of abuse I've put this and my laptop through to be normal use.Other thoughts:I did a test between this and an old old Jansport bag (also tough as nails).  I can fit just as much clothes in the jansport as this targus, and the transport "looks" about half the size. However I can't fit a laptop in the Jansport, and if I could squeeze it in, I couldn't fit anything else in.. go figure.

$REVIEW.: Great product, can't really beat it for the price.  I use it to run backups on my home PC using 1 of 2 hard drives, and I alternate storing them off-site at my workplace.My only qualm (hence 4 stars) is that it keeps the hard drive spun up when the computer turns off.  It would be great if it powered down along with the computer.

$review_text.: I decided that all I needed was to listen to 2 channels and that Dolby surround sound  was a nice trick that didn't mean much too me to justify the cost. This Harman Kardon HK3480 receiver allows listeners to have a very capable and powerful amp at a very very low price.  Typically, surround sound receivers will cost at least three times as much and give you much less power per channel.  For instance, I had a Denon 2805 which I paid over $800 for which had 7 channels of surround sound at 100 Watts per channel or listed as 135 Watts when playing two channel.  When I compared its two channel ability  to this Harman Kardons 125 Watts per channel the difference was night and day.  With the Denon the bass through my audiophile speakers - by my ears better than B&W; can be purchased at discount used at Audiogon.com) was grainy and distorted.  With the HK the bass became clear accurate and deep.  With the Denon the highs by my ears were slightly harsh and digital, and with the HK they were natural and warm yet still open.  Apparently Denon overstates their power and HK understates theirs.  The HK Amp will drive small and large speakers with warm deep clear sound and precision (it is low powered amps with distortion not high ones with clear sound  that blow out speakers).  If you don't need Dolby surround sound and if you are on a budget or not and just want strong clear warm sound don't look any further.  This amp is for you.This HK easily bested the Denon 2805 Home theater receiver falsly advertised at more Watts at about 1/4 the cost!P.S.  The row of small round buttons that look a gaudy silver in the photo are actually black and attractive.  My only complaint style-wise about this otherwise attractive receiver is the open gash with RCA plugs on the front pannel.  An optional cover would have been nice - but afterall, it is already competing with their much more expensive receivers!(One additional speaker note, if you want some bookshelf speakers with audiophile grade sound and plenty of bass at a great price, the Onix Reference 1 in the low 500 range at less than half price new on at Audiogon.com is the way to go.  Wonderful sound with a natural rosewood veneer.

$REVIEW.: I installed this into my early 2011 13&#34; MacBook Pro with no trouble. You will need a 00 Phillips screwdriver for the case and a Torx 6 to remove the nubs on the existing HDD and put them on the SSD.  My experience transferring data was a little different from what I've read. Because I bought a smaller SSD, I couldn't do a direct data clone. I also couldn't just load Mavericks from a flash.  I formatted the drive, then rebooted in Internet Recovery mode.  This caused Apple to take over the computer and automatically download the original OS, Lion.  Once that was done, I was able to upgrade to Mavericks and then do a Time Machine backup to right before I took out the original HDD.  It was a long and laborious process, but the only way I could get it to work.  The result is a computer that is lightning-fast (boots in 10 seconds and loads Word in 5 seconds!) and feels brand new for 1/10th the price of a new Mac. I only wish I'd done this two years ago.  If you want to compare your before and after speed, try the Blackmagic disk speed test.  I was amazed at my results.

I have a headset microphone, but the hard plastic clicks often when my jaw moves and I got tired of editing it out.It was a breeze to set up, though I have to say it took me a few minutes to figure out how the stand worked. It works fine with Windows 7, Audacity, Dragon Naturally Speaking, and for voice-overs in PowerPoint. I'm sure it works well with other software; those are just the ones I've used it with.So far I've used it only with solo recording, so I can't say how it would work with more than one speaker. For my purposes, though, it's just fine.

$REVIEW.: I am extremely overprotective of my digital files. I back them up on discs and thumb drives when I can, but I Always back them up on my external hard drives. And yes, that's plural. I back up my backed up content, and then make another backup for those. All in all, there's usually at least three 1-2TB drives with my stuff on them at any given moment, and a few more in waiting. I have all the major brands, Western Digital, Toshiba, and Iomega. This is my second Seagate and so far I like it even better than the previous model I own--Seagate Expansion 2 TB USB 3.0 Desktop External Hard Drive STAY2000102. Both are fast (when using 3.0 USB, and still pretty good with 2.0), both are incredibly quiet, and don't overheat. Though they all essentially do the same thing, back up your files, external hard drives aren't all created equal. I'm happy to say that this is one of the finer models I own. Here's my pros and cons:PROS:- Fast (but only Really fast if you're using USB 3.0. With regular 2.0, it's about average)- Quiet (by far the most quiet hard drive I've used. I find myself checking it to make sure it's actually turned on!)- Doesn't get extremely hot. Whatever cooling system Seagate uses seems to work. I've had no problems with overheating with their products.- Strong casing. Though I always prefer the hard metal casing for my hard drives, the plastic on this model is extremely strong and doesn't act like it could crack at any moment like theSeagate Expansion 2 TB USB 3.0 Desktop External Hard Drive STAY2000102does.CONS:- Software. I understand that the software included with this is VERY minimal and not required at all for normal use. Its simply there for a few benefits, like automatically shutting down after so many minutes of non-use. For some, this is an added bonus. For me, I'm superstitious and would prefer absolutely no software to be included whatsoever. It really isn't much of a worry, though, just don't install anything if you aren't interested in it.Overall, I'm extremely pleased. Fast, quiet, and cool are really the three most important components of an external hard drive, and this 2TB Seagate release fits the bill for me so far. It does just what it is made to do: store my stuff in a safe place. As long as it doesn't crash on me, I'll be extremely satisfied. I only wish it was cased in metal instead of plastic and didn't include any software at all.**NOTE: if I have any crashing problems or difficulties with this hard drive, I will naturally update my review accordingly.

$review_text.: I recently invested in a new iMac because of inadequate storage space on my previous model.  But since the exchange also bumped me up to a machine with USB 3.0 capability (now standard on all new Apple products, but you won't notice any more speed unless your accessories are also USB3.0),, it was difficult not to put to the test the purported improvement in speed of USB 3.0.  Accordingly, I picked up a light and compact WD drive--the My Passport 1TB USB 3.0.  Then, noticing the relative scarcity of "brand name" hubs with USB 3.0 connectivity, I first purchased a cheap 4-port version that could barely muster the strength to show on my iMac's desktop.  So I put it away, determined to remain content with a 7-port CyberPower USB 2.0 Hub that had served me well for the past 5-6 years.But the "need for speed" (and power) continued to gnaw away at me.  When I saw this EasyAcc USB 3.0 Hub, I couldn't resist.  Now I'm glad I didn't let the first, inferior USB 3.0 hub cloud my judgement.  The EasyAcc evidences better build quality, has a conspicuously more rugged transformer, and is even more stylish than the previous, retired model.  Most importantly, it takes the honors in the performance department, as demonstrated by the following speed test:1.  First, I copied my entire Applications Folder (10.8 Gb) to my new WD Passport drive with 3.0 USB, using the CyberPower USB 2.0 HUB. Time for completion: 7 minutes, 31 seconds.2. Next, I copied the same folder to the new WD drive with 3.0 USB, except using the EasyAcc USB 3.0 HUB.  Time for completion: 4 minutes, 44 seconds.The preceding test should make the case for both the pictured EasyAcc and USB 3.0 connectivity.  As for 7 ports vs. 4, the new iMac, unlike the previous model, practically makes a 7-port hub imperative.  With a laptop like the Macbook Air a 4-port hub is likely to suffice.  But not with the new iMac.  Apple's brain trust, for reasons known only to them, have removed the "Audio In" port (requiring the user to connect an audio interface such as the Griffin iMic or Behringer UFO202 to one of the 4 USB ports on the iMac).  Moreover, as was probably widely known by buyers before purchase, the innovative and seminal American company that banks on the predictability of unpredictability simply "excised" their vaunted versatile internal Apple drive-burner (the "SuperDrive"), cutting it out like a mere inconsequential "tumor" (for the sake of showing it can be done? or for a "pointless" thinner screen?).  Whatever the reason for these two curious, seemingly cosmetic or even arbitrary, removals of key features, the burden of compensation for the double loss is now placed upon the user.  The only solution has been to connect an audio interface plus an external burner to the second of the iMac's 4 USB ports (beware, however, the over-priced external SuperDrive, two of which I've had to "put down" like destructive pet pigs due to their insistence on "eating" my discs.Thus, instead of getting four USB inputs, the owner of the new iMac is likely to feel "robbed" of the original USB 2.0 ports, then compensated by Apple with a mere two 3.0 USB ports.  In fact, I was deeply regretting making the switch to the new iMac until coming upon this 7-port EasyAcc HUB (along with a decent-sounding Behringer audio interface and a dependable and inexpensive external Samsung burner).  In short, I couldn't get along without this 7-port HUB.  And USB 3.0 connectivity certainly lessens the pain of losing the Audio Input plus the iMac SuperDrive.  (If any additional consolation is needed, you can always turn the computer sideways and marvel at the thinness of the screen.  Just don't count on your friends sharing your enthusiasm. They probably already have a Vizio or LG high def TV set that's  three times larger than yours--and with screens a lot thinner--if they thought it of sufficient importance to bother to look.

$REVIEW.: This speaker looks like a mini-boombox from the 1980's, yet delivers music the "modern" way through Bluetooth. The Bluetooth range is around 20-25 feet before it cuts out, and the sound is decent enough, considering the price point. I can also plug in my Sandisk Clip Zip MP3 player that doesn't have Bluetooth. If there's no electric power nearby, you can use 8 AA batteries. This is waterproof and even though it's plastic, it seems strong enough to withstand some rough handling. Now don't go dunking this in the pool, it's not waterproof for that scenario, but occasionally getting splashed or rained on, this should withstand that no problem. An AC adapter is included, but you will need to purchase 8 AA batteries yourself. The speaker measures approximately 9.5" high x 5" wide x 5" deep.Tech Specs:Frequency Response: 30 Hz - 18 KHzDistortion: Less than 0.5%S/N Ratio: 65 dB (typical)Channel Separation: 50 dB (typical)Operation Distance: Up to 33 feet in an open areaOutput Power: 5W Max.Review sample provided.

$review_text.: The size is right, its about the size of a paperback.  I mainly listen to AM & FM band radio, and the reception on this little radio is awful.  Its astounding it costs so much, is from a company with a good reputation, and yet performs so poorly.  If you're addicted to all those non-AM & non-FM frequencies, okay, this radio is probably mediocre: bad reception, but inexpensive for what you get.  When one considers the actual performance of the device, it really disappoints.If I were stranded on a desert island, Gilligan-style, I'd want one of these, but here in the big city there are cheaper, and better alternatives.

$review_text.: I bought this because I'm required to carry a battery backup for my Ipad, and this looked like an inexpensive solution. I had little intention of actually putting it to much use; it only met a requirement. On one 4-day trip, though, I forgot to carry my power adapter, and as most people know, the Ipad can't be recharged via computer connection. So this battery was all I had for recharging purposes. It performed perfectly, giving my ipad a charge from about 70% to full, and giving my iphone a full charge as well from about 60%. This was enough to carry me through my trip without having to visit Best Buy or someplace to get a charger. Saved me money, people!

It does everything that I need it to do:  auto focus/flash, zoom...It uses AA batteries which is a plus in my book because I don't like having to recharge batteries (or buy replacement rechargables).  Since AA batteries are available everywhere, I never have to worry about battery levels.

The iPod and screen is totally protected, while you can see it perfectly. I love how it looks.The case opens easily if you open it from the top, not the bottom.One of the reasons I bought this case was for the belt clip feature, which I am not happy with. It is awkward to put on and take off the belt clip (you need to take it off to remove the iPod from the case). Worse, there is nothing to squeeze to open the clip to put it on and off. Once you get it on your waist, it is very difficult to get it off again. That's why I gave this 4 stars rather than 5.

$review_text.: I have been running two of these for at least 5 years now, probably more.  I use them exclusively as a hardware VPN between my office and my house.  They have been rock solid.The VPN tunnel was far from easy to set up.  When I first started, I had dynamic IPs on both ends of the tunnel which required dynamic DNS services and hours of playing with the settings to get it to connect.  But once connected, it was *always* connected.  I have drives mapped across the tunnel and do nightly off-site backups to NAS devices through it and never had an issue.Now I have static IPs at both ends and that setup is far easier.  One RV042 is even behind a NAT router and it still works great.I have tried unsuccessfully to get a software VPN client to connect to it.  It's definitely not for the faint of heart and if that is what you want it for, I would not get this model.They have been going strong for years and if you need a VPN tunnel I would recommend these. Though reading the comments, the battery issue has me a bit worried...

$REVIEW.: I began with my first one, and I noticed it had a bright pixel, so I contacted amazon's amazing customer service and they sent me a new one with one day shipping


When I got the second one, I found that it had FOUR bright pixels and one dark spot, in addition to many smaller dark spots along the edges of the display

I was planning on dealing with it because I didn't want to deal with the hassle of setting up a new one

That plan went down the drain when I couldn't boot to windows or restore it


If you're looking to get a replacement, make sure amazon has it in stock


I say this because the first time I tried to get the second replaced, my cs rep thought it would be adequate to have me pay for one for $50 more than the original and she'd do me the great favor of waiving the shipping cost
When I told her it would be a problem, she offered me a $20 promo credit

Of course I never got that promo credit, and I cancelled the return and replacement order because $300 extra taken out of my account just doesn't work


I waited until I saw it in stock shipped and sold by amazon, and tried again

This time everything went perfectly and I'm happy to report that the third one is 100% perfect


I would recommend this to anyone who is used to windows 8 and very patient


If you're used to an android tablet, it will take a while to get used to


Give it a couple weeks and you'll be using it in a completely different way than any other tablet

If not, return it and buy a Nexus 7.


$SUMMARY.: It may take a while to get a good one, but when you do it's great.

$REVIEW.: This is an excellent mouse. Up till now I've been using a Logitech MX510. The MX510 is excellent, but I prefer the MX1000. The MX1000 is silky smooth. It just glides and the pointer is spot-on accurate. Now this mouse might not be for everyone. It is a little bit chubbier and heavier then other Logitech mice. This is not problem for people with big hands like me. I find the chubby design & deep thumb groove very comfortable. If your a gamer who consistently picks up and re-centers the mouse a lot, the weight may be a problem. Even though it is a little on the heavy side, it is very well blanced, and the extra large mouse feet make it easy to push around. I have used the mouse to play games like Battlefield Vietnam, Unreal 2k4, & to photo edit in photoshop with no problems. I haven't experienced any of the lag others claim to have experienced. Actually I can't tell the difference between this mouse and my corded MX510 in response times. This is the only cordless mouse I have used without any noticeable lag. I also like the button placement better on this mouse compared to the MX510. The application switch button is placed in a much more desirable location on the MX1000, and I like the click wheel better, it's a tad smoother then the MX510. Overall this mouse feels very nice, it doesn't feel cheap. That's probably cuz it's not, but it's worth it! Treat yourself and get one. By the way, the battery will last longer then any other cordless and the battery indicator will tell you when to charge. How cool is that?

$review_text.: I bought this for $67 used ("like new") from Amazon's Warehouse Deals (free prime shipping!)Great things about this device:* Stellar graphics in maps and user interface* Fast route calculations and recalculations* Quick address entry (vs. Garmin's lengthy method of inputting city first, then street, then number)* Descriptive voice prompts ("next right" instead of "right in 200 feet")* Accurate text to speech pronunciations* Sturdy windshield suction mountSome issues:* Screen completely washes out when sunlight is behind you* Voice prompts tend to prefer route numbers ("Illinois 10") over actual street name ("Springfield Ave")* Poor support from Motorola; latest maps are more than a year old* Software has some glitches here and there; almost feels like beta version* Takes slightly longer to acquire satellites than Garmin* No speed limit display except on interstate highways* Can't change units from yards to feet* Some voice prompts come too late ("turn at next right" when you're 1 second away from the intersection)* Voice recognition can't input new destinationsOn net, this GPS is only so-so. If you're a sucker for extremely polished graphics, you'll love this, but functionally a Garmin/TomTom/Magellan might be better, especially since those companies' latest map updates are more than one year newer than Motorola's at the time of this review.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this card to act as a solid-state drive for a linux PC I was building.I was surprised at how long it took to install the OS on the card, and so I did a little bit of testing.While the reading speed was indeed about 40 MB/sec, the writing speed was much slower: approximately 10MB/sec or even 8 MB/sec, in my testing based on the ext4 file system.I then switched to a Kingston card of the same capacity and same 266x rating, and I got 25 MB/sec writing speeds. Since the Kingston card costs about the same, I do not think that the Patriot card is very good in performance or value for money if writing speed is important to you.

$review_text.: This is a no-frills, off-brand cover for about ten bucks. It really needs the cover in addition to the back in order to cover all the sides, so it will cost quite a bit more if you purchase the branded cover to use with the back. One of the benefits of purchasing the back separately from the cover is the ability to customize a bit. However, when you can get an off-brand back and cover for just a few bucks more than the back alone, I'm not certain why anyone would purchase just this item. For example, seePoetic SLIMLINE Portfolio Case for Apple iPad Mini.The included screen protector was poor quality and difficult to apply. Thankfully we had another because it was useless and far inferior to other screen protectors we tried. The packaging is anything but frustration-free - the plastic around the back is incredibly difficult to remove, and I can easily envision someone scratching up the cover with a scissors or knife trying to get the "protective" part off.At the end of the day, I'd say it's just an OK item. The item protects the mini from fingerprints but probably won't do much to protect it from a fall. At the end of the day, I think there are better options available than this back that leaves one side open for the addition of a magnetic cover.

$REVIEW.: Designed for university and college students, faculty, and staff, this Microsoft Office suite is thorough. It provides a 4-year subscription to the following software: MS Word, Excel, Access, OneNote, Publisher, Outlook and PowerPoint.It does not contain a disc, but simply an online security key. It appears that you you need to have a Microsoft account to install the software, though there may be a way to skip that.Installation on our two laptops went beautifully, with everything working fine. You can install the software on two PCs, Tablets, or Macs.As a bonus, the software includes free minutes on Skype, and SkyDrive with 20 GB of storage. At around $60, this is an affordable option for most college students.The software is compatible with Windows 7 or newer, so don't purchase it for your XP or older machine.So far, so good. The programs have worked without any major glitches. So far, we've been very, very pleased.

$review_text.: Love these Sennheiser wireless headphones. At age 72 I found my hearing beginning to have trouble picking up some voices from movies on tv. And visiting a friend with the same trouble but who had purchased a pair of these Sennheisers more to help prevent disturbing his wife when watching tv at night, I found they helped overcome my problem. So I bought two pair with one charging cradle just to be sure I wouldn't run out of power in the middle of a movie. What a great buy. Comfortable, occasionally a bit difficult to keep on my head when I bend over to pick up a newspaper or something, but with a range allowing me to roam my house and not miss a play during a football game or a pitch during baseball, I consider this one of my better purchases of recent years. I recommend them enthusiastically.

 For those who don't understand, take a moment to read the directions and look at how this device is supposed to be oriented on an antenna mast
 There is no problem mounting this amplifier on your antenna mast out in the elements

 Not yet wanting to take the precarious trip to my roof, I attached this amplifier to my antenna lead inside my home where it enters my basement over two stories from the antenna


 It immediately boosted signals to the tv in the basement rec room


 I was really hoping it would compensate for signal loss to another tv in an upstairs family room


 It did, and I am very satisfied with this purchase

 Would definitely buy again.Oh yes, when I get around to scaling the roof I'll likely move it up there.

$review_text.: With the webcam war between Microsoft and Logitech, Logitech has so far been on top with its quality web cameras especially in low light conditions and video quality.This time around, the Microsoft LifeCam Show is now available with it's thin and sleek design.  The LifeCam show comes with a 1 ft. stand, a magnetic stick and also a clip on for laptops.  Also, boasting a good number of fun features, easily outnumbering the amount of features found in Logitech's QuickCam software and even Apple's visual effects.The ease of install is simply installing the program on CD, which I tested on one Laptop and it took around 10+ minutes (which is not bad compared to other webcam software programs that have to load all the special features).The first test was through AIM (easy to use on AIM) and video quality showed quite a bit of artifacting and noise in low light room conditions and increasing the quality in full video was about the same when viewed from a laptop.  On the opposite end, I tested to see how things looked when viewed on my 24" iMac and it was soft and not as clear compared to a similarly priced Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000.I then did a test on two well known video-streaming sites which I did a broadcast using the Microsoft LifeCam Show and overall, a similar look as I had on AIM.On good light situation, with proper amount of sunlight in the room, thinks looked a bit better and although you have control over brightness, saturation, sharpness, etc.  I was not able to come up with very clear video.Even using the Microsoft software, in a smaller screen, things look clearer but still too dark.Then I started to do some mobile lifecasting with the product and I wish the wire was a bit longer, so when walking around or placing your laptop in your bag and just doing a lifecast, you really need to keep the lifecam closer to you (pinned to your bag arm strap or your shirt) rather than the extra line to hold the camera up while walking.As for the special features, their are many which were quite fun (from rain, lightning, static images to moveable images and facial changes).  I must admit though, that some of the effects that require body movement hung and I was waiting for minutes.  Granted, I was testing this on a 3 year old laptop with only 2GB of ram but loading some effects took much longer than I would like.And as for software, you get the Microsoft camera program, you get the ability to install Microsoft Live chat, etc.Overall, the product is easy to use, it looks sleek and cool, a lot of effects to keep people happy, in fact my wife and my child loved the many effects included.  But for many people who are looking for a camera for lifecasting or streaming broadcasts, the camera doesn't do well in low light conditions.  You definitely want to have a lot of light nearby.  But otherwise, the camera may be too dark for some.  Also, I wish the cord was much longer for those who want to do mobile lifecasting and tend to keep their laptops in their bag while walking or for those who want to lifecast and need the additional length.So, overall, it's a good camera but when compared to a Logitech Webcam Pro 9000 which is similarly priced, the LifeCam show doesn't function well in low light conditions even when you have tweaked the controls.
$review_summary.: Easy to use, comes with a lot of fun features but for it's price under lowlight conditions is where the LifeCam underperforms

$REVIEW.: For about $6, this was a great product, to install it onto my iPad, i remembered many people having problems with the orange fiber cloth, so i decided not to use it and use another fiber cloth to clean my screen completely


Then i took off the first layer (*1), i matched up the circle home button with the one on the screen protector and then i made sure it was parallel with the sides of the ipad before putting it on


After that was done, i started to bend the screen protector on the the screen while using some stiff card to make sure there were no bubbles

Once that was completed, I took off the second layer (*2) easily

After i was finished with the whole thing, i tried to remove some of the bubbles on the side.Overall, this took at most five minutes and was really easy to install, many of the people are complaining maybe because of their impatience or lack of hand eye coordination skills
I would have given a 5/5 but the screen protector slightly reduces the image quality as other customers have said (*3).(*1) - In the instructions, it says to peel off the blue layer while putting the screen protector on


I took it off completely and was careful not to touch the protector
Came out fine.(*2) - Orange layer, held it by the little slip on the corner and pulled it off.(*3) - The image reduction is not that noticeable.

$review_text.: I've used a lot of cheap blanks in my day.  I remember first stumbling upon Maxell XLII's cassettes and remembering how great they were with music...quality you could hear, back then.  With digital, I didn't give a lot of thought to the blanks...I thought "digital is forever".  Well, yes and no.  Hard drives crash.  The cloud is still, well, the cloud.  How many different media services have you seen start up like gangbusters and go under?  So, I always would burn optical backups of programs, documents and pics.  Now, in reviewing some of my older stuff, it's clear, that the cheaper blanks I used haven't held up well.  It's not like I leave them in a car, or anything, but, even then, some data would be undreadable...some audio-cd's would de-laminate.  There is some thought that the "gold" layer on these won't suffer those same problems.  So, while I will have to wait 10 years to truly judge, I can say that Verbatims I've burned in the past, have held up well...their dye is quite good.  The no-name generics, well, they've struggled.  So, it stands to reason that Verbatim's top of the line "gold" standard would do just as well if not better than prior Verbatims.And while I can re-rip music, my personal documents and photos would be impossible to replace.  I no longer have "film" backups to go back to for my pictures, hence my interest in archival quality media.If I want to trust my data for life, I am sure to keep it in different formats and on different media...anything important, I burn to these archival gold...as some memories, can't be recreated.

$REVIEW.: I way trying to get this card at Frys Electronics and wow, was shocked and amazed: They had NO PCI express cards, NONE! What the hell??? Who is idiotic enough to buy a PCI card still? That standard is so over, once you get a board without PCI slots (which you should) your card is trash

I don't understand why these ancient standards linger around so much

Anyway, I was deeply disappointed about Frys
Sadly, I can see why brick and mortal computer retail is dying, the often just don't have the stuff you want

$review_text.: I used to have the Logitech mm50, which I loved
 Since getting a newer iPod nano 5th gen, I needed speakers that will charge it while playing.The POSITIVES of this product is the sound
 This will definitely fill up a room, but not a terribly large one at that

 It is well balanced for consumer ears and does not produce any noticeable distortion thus far

 The second positive is the ability use the remote to control your music


 You can even use it to navigate the folders, although I'm not certain if this will work for iPod touches or iPhones.Onto the NEGATIVES
 After about a year or so, minor problems begin to creep up that really start to annoy you

 First off, the speakers will turn off for no good reason in softer passages of music played at low volume, especially with classical music


 Second, the remote build quality has little to be desired
 The button labels are starting to wear out very badly

 The older Logitech mm50 had none of those problems from what I recall.Another annoyance, though this may be minor for some is that often times when the speakers are relatively low in battery, the both the buttons on the unit itself and the remote won't work as intended

 It will turn on for a brief second before turning off, and turning it back on properly loses its volume settings


 So if you had your speakers set a low volume and this happens, it will start playing loudly


 Not very good for a relatively quiet office environment.OVERALL these are good speakers, but if you're picky, you might not like it in the long run.

$REVIEW.: These monitors are SO good

 I've used only a few flat panel monitors, and pretty much none of them was ever as good as my old Sony Trinitron tube monitors


 The clarity just isn't there.These are the first monitors I've ever purchased where I could honestly say I won't be wanting to fire up the Sonys anymore!  While they were wonderfully clear, they simply don't equal these Viewsonics in clarity and sheer eye-popping color

 These really are amazing
 I've purchased a total of five of them - they are all identical in their rendering of video output from the same video card - at least to my eye
 Now, I only use autocad a little, mostly I write software, so text clarity is important to me
 Turning these on their side (with a rotating stand that attaches to the back, they DO NOT rotate by themselves), these monitors are just plain perfect for me to write code


 I use them in a Right-Oriented, Horizontal, Left-Oriented fashion so as to make the most of my triples, and so far, this is the best setup I've EVER had.

$review_text.: I have been through a couple of indoor HDTV antennas. None came close to the performance of this one. I am in a notoriously 'bad reception' area just outside of Chicago. The best antenna I had before this one was an RCA omni-directional; but I still could not get CBS 2 with it nor could I get all the channels it could receive at once. I constantly had to get up and move the antenna while simultaneously checking signal strength on my T.V.(thank God for that feature on my T.V.-Samsung ROCKS!) But it was truly a pain in the butt constantly moving it around and holding it in the air! When I got this one(in less than five days with standard free shipping I might add-thank you Amazon), I had it out of the box and attached to my T.V. within five minutes. Definitely get the 'amplified' version of this antenna, there is a difference. This is the Terk HDTVa, not 'i' - it is worth it, trust this! Go to [...] to compare. This was the third highest rated Terk antenna on their site, the other two were outdoor antennas! That and the fact that it is one of the highest rated indoor antennas on Amazon and TERK's quality were the only factors that influenced my purchase. Because it is one ugly antenna! But if you like modern art, you'll love the look too. Point is that it works well. It took me a weekend of playing around with it to find the "sweet-spot". This is when I was blown away! Not only do I get all of the UHF/VHF signals, but I have not touched the antenna in weeks. Once in awhile I get a little scramble on CBS, or some of the less powerful signals, but it is not often and it goes away. I also pick up 47 channels now! Half of them are in Spanish, but that's' O.K.; it still impressed me. Before with the RCA the best I could get was 31 - That's a big difference. Auto-scan your t.v. before you hook up the TERK! I don't know why this works, but it does; I've done it several times before and always got better results. Make sure you auto-scan your t.v. several times with the antenna attached with the antenna in different locations until you get the 'Optimal' locale in your room. The first scan I did allocated 34 channels, second scan I got 38, the third time was the 'sweet-spot' that netted me 47! Note:that I did this over a course of maybe 2 days of occasional 'fidgeting'. This just comes with the territory if you want free HDTV. The picture quality is superior to all of my friends with cable and dish(they told me this, not my words) But I agree and it is worth it. Also the rabbit ears are a lot longer than they look so extend them all the way to get the best reception on that hard to get signal - that's how I 'found' CBS. I knew this was worth it when my wife saw a food show on WTTW in 1080i and said, "My God that food looks so real I could touch it and I think I can smell it too." - Enough said.

$review_text.: First of all, I have to say that this is one of the classiest and feature rich keyboards ever made. It comes with a leather wristpad, a zoom lever, buttons to adjust volume, and it looks damn good in black.My dissapointments are as follows:1. My Dell precision M70 will not boot up with the keyboard plugged in. I have to unplug it, let Windows load, and then plug it back in.2. The very first time I launch Firefox, the Zoom function will go crazy and totally zoom out on my screen. I then have to "unzoom" it back to normal.3. The keys are not as "soft" as my previous Microsoft Natural Elite for CTX. I have some carpal tunnel in my hands, and while the pain from using this keyboard is noticeable, it is not unbearable.Conclusion: I am going to keep this as my home keyboard, for casual use. I would not recommend it for work because of all the hassles involved.EDIT: This keyboard, particularly it's Intellitype software is a nightmare. The "u" key randomly doesn't work. The other keys seem pretty flimsy too. The Intellitype 5.5 software causes my laptop to zoom out and in when various applications are launched, even Microsoft Word. The only good thing about this experience is that Microsoft has such great customer service, and will allow me a refund--this does not include shipping costs, so ship using the cheapest methods!

$REVIEW.: I'm writing this review because I recently purchased a pair of Noise Canceling Headphones for some cross-country airplane travel I have coming up

 I'm a UM2 owner and have enjoyed them immensely but I thought for sure that a nice pair of noise canceling headphones would make for a quieter, more relaxing flight


 So when I received these new noise canceling headphones I immediately tried them...and to my surprise the sound quality was NO WHERE NEAR my UM2's!  It wasn't even close.Then I compared how much noise I could hear with both, again the UM2's were far better and they don't bill themselves as noise canceling

 Thus the reason I went out and purchased the noise canceling 'cans'.On top of that, I had to play the volumn louder on the noise canceling headphones to compete with outside noise
 The final note I made was it didn't take long before the noise canceling headphones started to feel warm and uncomfortably so.I had "heard" enough

 I boxed them up and returned them the same day


 Sometimes, you don't know how good you have it until you buy another set of headphones


 Yes, when I originally purchased my UM2's I compared them to a number of high-end ear buds like a few from Shure, Etoymotic and a few others and it was the clear winner with much cleaner, detailed sound.But I quickly found out I didn't need to spend more money because what I have is truly an outstanding product

 So I wanted to share my experience.

$review_text.: I put off buying a DVI cable when I bought my last PC because it was new technology and my budget was able to spend another $60-$80 on a video cable.Recently I was working on calibrating my monitor for color perfect workflow (so my digital photos would print the same way they look on screen and at the photo shoot). As I was doing this it occurred to me that I was still using a DVI to VGA converter from my video card and running an old-school VGA cable to my monitor. Because I felt silly using state of the art technology for color calibration while not using the same for my video connection. I looked around and found this cable on Amazon and ordered it.The cord comes packaged in a printed plastic zip-lock style bag. There are no instructions or documentation that come with it. Some people might find this odd, but you really don't need any documentation. It is a cable; you plug it in and screw down the connectors.The cable does its job. I have noticed that fine details are sharper and more clear. It is not mind-blowing, but it is better than VGA.The construction of the cable seems nice as well. It seems very sturdy. I know another reviewer said it was flimsy and another said the contacts were all bent, but this was not my case. The shielding is robust and the cable head seems well constructed. The connector pins were all in good condition. The screw connectors were made well and easy to use.For most people this will be a great cable. The length of this cable is about six feet so you are only running this cable from your computer to your monitor. This means the cable does not need to be "gold-plated" or "double insulated" or any of the other "sales terms" used by companies like Monster and Best Buy (Geek Squad).My recommendation is you save yourself $50 or more and buy this cable rather than getting charged quite a bit more for essentially the same product in different packaging at one of the retail chains.Overall, I would definitely purchase this again.-Cheers!

$REVIEW.: I  recently got an iPad Mini but ordered a case, screen protectors, and these ear buds from Amazon. Read reviews and specs for Sony, Bose, Panasonic et al. Specs for these just as good or better, price less than half or better, excellent comments on Amazon and a trust in Amazon for good products. Ordered them and got more than expected. Well constructed with metal, not plastic. Angled and marked &#34;L&#34; & &#34;R&#34; for ears and you get 4 sets of silicone pads for perfect fit to your ear canal. Outside sounds blocked out, tonal range excellent and comfortable to wear for hours at a time! The iPad Mini does have speakers but so small and you have to compete with dogs barking, phones ringing, people talking, and food being cooked to hear. These buds block all that out and the full range of tones and stereo is excellent. By the way, I am 65 and my hearing ain't what it used to be. I now enjoy listening to the 60's Oldies on Pandora, watching videos on Amazon Prime, or playing my own music downloaded to the iPad from my iMac on iTunes. They come with their own pouch for storage, have a long warranty, and excellent customer service in the e-mails received from the company itself. Had not heard of GoGroove before and this is apparently a new product. I don't understand all the specs and special materials used, but they are comfortable and work very well. Only downside is that my old eyes without glasses can't see the &#34;L&#34; and &#34;R&#34; markings. I suggest color coding like black for left and silver for right or a combo that a customer could order to go with their favorite pro or college team's colors. I got 99.99% of what I wanted. Go for it!

I am using them at home on computer, via personal and business laptop and my work computer too, but the center retractor section is a bit heavier than expected when in use, tugging/pulling on ear piece inserts a bit, even utilizing the clip on.

$REVIEW.: I purchased these mounts for the side and back speakers of a 7.1 home theater setup
I got them at the same time as myPolk Audio RM6751 Satellite Speakers, so I did not know what to expect.The mounts are really easy to install

The base is attached to the ceiling or wall using two screws


I used drywall screws to secure my mounts and they're holding perfectly.A number of adjustment screws in the mounts allows you to rotate and bend the mount to suit your specific needs

In my case, I'm using the rotation and bend to aim the speakers towards the center of the room, where surround is meant to converge.The mounts come with various attachments to use for different types of speakers and it even included an allen wrench to use for adjustment of the screws
This came in handy, as the allen wrench is easier when you're on top of a ladder


All considered, it took me about 5 minutes to install and aim each mount
After a couple of months of continuous use, the mounts are holding find


I'm very satisfied with them and would definitely recommend them for similar applications.

Before these two devices were in place, we'd get an annoying hum or sound buildup from the laptop. I figured this was a ground loop issue and went hunting for a cure. Based upon the price, I figured these would be junk; however, I was thrilled when they got deployed. These completely eliminated the audio buzz/hum we were having in both room. It works just as well as a similar $50 unit I also bought. I figured these would be junk, and boy was I wrong.

$review_text.: Bought this device for my wife, who was simply fed up with her Windows laptop - every time she opened the laptop, it had updates to do, viruses to scan for and so many "housekeeping" type of activities, that she dreaded to turn it on.  Even without those, the laptop would take a long time to boot up. Now, to be fair, she had a "cheap" laptop - a $700 Lenovo that gave us all that it promised to, but was simply a pain to actually use.Anyway, fast forward to today - 6 months in to having her Chromebook - and she loves it.  Is it perfect?  No, but close to it for the way she uses it.  It could be a little faster at times, but it is lightyears ahead of her Lenovo, even on the day we bought it.  For half the price, her Chromebook gives her twice the experience.The best parts for her are: boots in seconds, wakes from sleep almost instantly and she doesn't need to worry about spam, malware or anything else.  When she has 15 minutes to use it, she is USING it, not waiting for it to be ready to use.The best parts for me are: nearly zero "IT" support and a wife that actually checks her email.  With Windows, I was constantly having to intervene when things went wrong.  She has used a computer for years, so it wasn't "user error" or things like that.  Its just all the crud that comes with running a Windows machine.  On average, she needed help one out of three sessions with Windows and it isn't like that with the Chromebook - I can think of one time in 6 months that she needed help, and that was that our cable modem needed a reboot.  Now, because her laptop is so easy to use, she actually USES it!  I can actually communicate with her via email, calendar, google docs, etc.  All that and no admin overhead?  I was really skeptical, but now I'm sold.

$review_text.: First of all everyone was complaining about getting the 550 version but im pretty sure they fixed this issue already.  I ordered mine on 11-29-13 and got the 590 version.  Actually the camera arrived 2 days later... and i live in Hawaii!I was thinking about getting a GoPro for a dash cam but they are just way too expensive for me.  I had been looking around for a cheaper dash cam but $25 was too cheap and $200 was too much.  I came across this one somehow and saw how good the footage was on youtube.  Its not the best but for $100... it was just right and the interface was simple and easy to use.  You don't even have to read the manual, tho the manual is useless anyway.  The camera is about the size of a GoPro but thinner and a tad lighter.  It is threaded on the top and bottom so you can mount it using any tripod upright or upside down.  Daytime footage looks very nice and night time (in city) is okay.  It has a mini HDMI port on the camera but does not come with the cables.  It can take still photos and 5MP by pushing one of the buttons.  The editing software it comes with is pretty basic but i noticed when i try to stitch it together, it hiccups 2 secs at the end of clip #1 and 2 secs at the beginning of clip #2.  Playing the clips individually comes out fine.  It also comes with a window mount, similar to a GPS suction cup mount, and it holds like glue.Features:Full HD - 1080p/30fps or 720p/30fps. Not super clear to read license plates in the far distance but pretty darn clear. Records only in 3 min or 5 min intervals.128 Degree view - This is not fish eye with a lot of distortion but enough to see beginning of side streets at an intersection.Focus - 1.5m - infinityAudio Recording - Also records your video in audio.  Picks up everything in the car and conversation near your window but nothing further.  Can be turned off.2.4" LCD screen - You can watch what you're recording, review the footage, or turn the screen off to save battery.  Not a touch screen.Time Stamp - All recordings can be date/time stamped.  This can be turned off.Automatic Record - You can set the camera to record once you turn it on or when it senses voltage from the cig lighter.  If you turn this off, you can start the recording manually by pressing one of the buttons.Emergency Recording - Footage is looped and replaced when you run out of memory but you can permanently save recordings with a push of a button to prevent it from getting replaced.Collision Detection - Camera has a shock sensor with 3 sensitivities to automatically start recording.  I believe this footage is automatically saved as an emergency recording.Motion Detection - When camera is off and your car is parked, this can be turned on to start recording from any motion in the cameras view and i think in the cabin.LED Light - Comes with a really bright LED to probably help enhance night shots.  Never used it but i heard ppl complain it reflected off the windshield.Built in Battery - Lithium-ion battery.  Some ppl say it lasts a couple hours recording with LCD screen off.  Never tried it.Mounting Hardware - Comes with a super strong suction cup mount and tripod mount.  Mount has a huge range of motion.Cigarette Lighter Adapter - Comes with Cig adapter with a mini USB port.  This is used to charge the unit or you could run the camera off of it.  The cord is pretty long so you can route the wires out of your view.Memory - Doesn't have internal memory and uses a micro SD card up to 32 GB (class 4+ recommended & SD card not included).  32 GB equates to about 8-9 hours of footage.  Night time footage seems to use less memory.  Although it has a mini USB port, it does not come with connecting cables, only charging cable.Footage Files - Records only in 3 min or 5 min intervals but stitched together should come out smooth without notice.  Plays with Windows media player, VLC player, and Quicktime.  Files save as a .MOV when i play it with VLC but the file folder says file type as TMT3.  Im not a computer guy so i dont know.  Also comes with basic editing software (ArcSoft) and can be played in that.In all... This is an ideal dash cam with all the features you need and small enough not to obstruct your view.  If i were to do it again... i would still buy it.  4 out of 5 stars because i know there are a lot better stuff out there, but at a cost.

$REVIEW.: I needed some small speakers to go in my home recording studio so, I looked around a bit and found these. For the price, you can't beat them. As others have stated, these ARE NOT "professional" studio monitors. In fact, it says right on the box, "stereo speaker set". But, I'm OK with that because, guess what? I'm NOT a professional!! I'll just list the pros and cons below:Pros:1. They are LOUD! I usually only put the gain at about 1/4 to 1/3 full.2. They're pretty compact, don't take up a lot of space.3. The built in amp is awesome. I could use these with anything.4. I really like the bass and treble controls. I have the bass turned up to 1/2 and it THUMPS!5. They're really easy to set up.Cons:1. The cabinets are made of thin plastic, would probably break fairly easily if dropped.2. There's an annoying blue "power" light on the front of the main speaker. Don't stare at it too long or you'll be seeing blue spots for a couple minutes.3. The gain, bass and treble controls REALLY should have been placed on the front of the unit. Bit of a hassle when you want to adjust something.4. There's no mid-range speaker OR control knob for adjustment. No biggie.Again, overall, they sound AWESOME for the price and they look pretty good too.
$review_summary.: Good bang for the buck!

$review_text.: Though product descriptions can be lacking at times, when a description says "Fits most SLR/DSLR flash mounts/hot shoes (Minolta & Sony excluded)" I would interpret this to mean that Nikon cameras would be included. That may be a big leap of faith - or maybe I read too much into this, but this doesn't even come close to fitting in my Nikon D7000. When I tried to put it it in literally cracked itself. If it weren't inappropriate to say that this is a piece of $#@! than I would, but I should probably find a better way to say it... Don't waste your money on a product that can not do what it is supposed to do.

$review_text.: Please carefully read the forums before you use this in a NAS environment
I purchased two identical 2TB drives 16 months ago


They both completely failed simultaneously or near simultaneously (company was fine on Friday afternoon -- RAID 1 array had dropped both drives by Monday)
This has happened to many, many people to the point where QNAP has decertified these drives due to a large number of customer failures during life
The way modern drives are designed they will often self-correct as they fail until one day they catastrophically die
No bad sector warnings like we were accustomed to in the nineties and oughts

Which let you lose ten files instead of 220 thousand files
These drives have key features that make them particularly unsuitable for NAS such as deep error recovery


Go buy a NAS-specific Seagate or Western Digital drive if your NAS data or your time mean much to you


 And always make backups


Glad I did.

$REVIEW.: To be fair I was not expecting very much from this product. I used it hiking in the grand canyon and to my surprise it did work, somewhat. The charging capacity only would charge and ipod nano about half way which got me thorough the hike. Unfortunately after using the USB slot the connection adapter fell into the unit it self. Basically after the second use i could no longer charge anything, so at the end of the day it can be used as a solar power flash light which makes the purchase not a complete fail.

$review_text.: I pre-ordered my Prime 11/24 from TigerDirect and received it on 1/4.First impressions:Very nice packaging, just big enough to fit the tablet's surface area, with a very solid construction to it. I had no fear of shipping damage after I held the box in my hands. Inside was 10.1 inches of widescreen gadget glory, and a few accessories, (Charger, USB cable, microfiber cloth, manual)Tablet was heavier than I imagined, but had a GREAT feel to it. Mind-blowingly thin. The back of the device has a nice matte feel due to the anodized brushed aluminum surface. It is a pleasure to hold in both hands, and absolutely is nice to look at. It is a little bit heavy when holding with just one hand, but that is to be expected with 10.1 inch tablets. The edges are a little sharp, not annoyingly so, but definitely noticable. The finish on the back is a very dark grayish-purple. Yes, purple, but not immasculine. Its a great color for the device, absolutely no complaints on style.Screen:This thing is gorgeous. The pixel density is just right for this size device, and reading web pages is an easy process. The contrast is fantastic for an LCD, and the colors absolutely pop. I'm no display expert, but I know for certain this is the best display I have ever seen on a tablet, smartphone, netbook, and 99% of laptops. It can get obscenely bright in "Super IPS" mode, which is great for using outdoors, which was once no-mans-land for LCD displays.UI/SoftwareIt is running Android 3.2.1 Honeycomb. Just that sentence alone will give you some insight on the UI's look and feel and responsiveness. I like the look and layout of Honeycomb, but the optimization and snappyness is subpar. Of course I will attribute this purely to the sluggish mess that is Android Honeycomb, and not to the blazing fast quad-core monster inside of the deivce. The included Asus UI is great, I have no complaints about any of the menu layouts or widgets etc, in fact, it is very nice to look at. Props to Asus for making a smart, sensible UI layer that anyone can use. The included cloud storage, "Webshare" or something of the sort is nice to have, but I will probably stick to dropbox for my cloud storage. Asus includes remote desktop software that works flawlessly, and a DLNA streaming app that I find intuitive and well executed.Honestly, any software problems or sluggishness will be addressed with ICS on January 12th, so I am not worried about it for now.Hardware/performanceHoly crap.This machine is fast. It absolutely slaughters every other device in EVERY benchmark. Well done, NVIDIA, this Tegra 3 chip is a phenom. The performance is most apparent in gaming, when all four cores are working to their full potential. Games have that extra layer of realism that really makes the difference between mobile gaming, and real, console quality stuff.One spec I did not realize was included in this machine is the ability to play games in real, stereoscopic 3d when connected to a 3DTV. I played Riptide GP in 3d, and Shadowgun in 3d as well on my 50 inch samsung plasma, and I was floored! Definitely a huge statement to the performance of this machine. Well done, everyone.Really no more needs to be said about this device's performance other than "its fast. really fast."CameraCameras on tablets look ridiculous. This is true with any tablet. One cannot pull out a 10.1 tab and casually snap a few shots. The whole thing is a rather hilarious affair. Otherwise, the Cameras on the TF201 are absolutely top notch. Video is clear and smooth in 1080p, and still shots look better than my point'n'shoot. The webcam works great for skype. Good work team.Video playbackFlawless with MX Video Player. 1080p30 on a 50 inch plasma is fantastic. No complaints, and no more needs to be said. It just works.And now for the bad.The GPS issue is a well documented problem. There are ons of explanations for why the GPS is not as accurate as one would hope. Basically, Asus missed a key design point here. The aluminum construction blocks radio waves in a big way. It is a simple fix that could have been prevented by Asus when designing the thing.Wifi performance is also affected, though less noticably. The range is not as good as my thinkpad's. Not a dealbreaker, but it is a rather glaring oversight.EDIT: (Lighthearted sarcasm alert)Who uses a tablet without 3G for GPS anyways? I mean cmon guys. Its a wifi tablet. Using this as a nav system in my car would give me a good chuckle, and really nothing else.Ignore the one-star whiners that don't even own the thing. It is hands-down, the best device on the market.

$review_text.: This camera is amazing. Some of the video that I've taken is as good as High Definition on PBS. However, the setup has to be right. Most importantly you need to take the video outside or if you must be inside then with as much light as you can get. It reminds me of the old super 8 movie days - I wish I had kept my light stick !Now with the negatives on other reviews.No viewfinder - so what? - good riddance.You have to remove the battery to hook up the hdmi to your tv - again, so what?No auxilary external mic input - so what.....you get the idea - if you want that stuff (by all means) go buy a different camera - personally I wouldn't pay $50 more for all of that stuff...There is no "defect" that has baring on using the product as an everyday  family camcorder.Anyhow, I'm amazed at how much High definition video fits on a 8gb sdhc card. I would say an hour of video fits easily.The software that comes with the camera is not usable. Seriously - it is junk. Plan on buying other software to video edit.

$REVIEW.: I installed this in my netbook to replace a failed HDD and did a fresh install of Windows 7 x64 Ultimate. Boot time is ~25 seconds, down from 50-60 seconds. I disabled defrag and indexing because they are unnecessary and increase wear and tear of the drive. I can boot the netbook in 25 seconds and have firefox open 5 seconds later. However, this does not make up for the anemic CPU in my netbook. Before, I rarely had 100% CPU usage, usually extended periods of 40-50% usage. Now I have 100% bursts: The CPU is the bottleneck now. My total windows experience score is 2.9(due to CPU), but the SSD gets 7.8 out of 7.9 possible. If I were to put this drive in a full-fledged modern laptop with a quad core CPU and 8 GB of RAM, I imagine it would fly.

$review_text.: I own this camera, my second digital camera, and I am exceptionally happy with it!  I will not go into all the technical details about this camera, as this information is available in the product description and in other reviews.  I will say that this is not a camera for one just getting into digital photography.  This is a (near) professional quality instrument and has so many options that one not grounded in digital photography would be quickly overwhelmed.  It is also higher priced than the typical consumer-grade digital camera, with an asking price of right arund $1400 dollars at the time of this writing.  Once you add a couple of filters, a telephoto zoom lens, and some other accessories, you quickly have an investment of over $2,000 dollars.  Thus, this is not a camera for the masses.If you are looking for a camera that provides you with all the versitility of a SLR quality film camera, you have come to the right place.  Canon's 20D will absolutely overwhelm you with its extensive options!  This is truly a versitile instrument that will allow you to do virtually anything in photography!  I don't think it is an exaggeration to say that the Canon 20D is the best camera for its price in its class. It blows the competition away.The camera body has a firm heavy feel to it.  It is not a miniature digital camera at all.  It fills and fits the hand nicely, much like a SLR should feel.  The buttons, wheels, and controls are all within finger reach, but there are so many options that one has a pretty good learning curve to be proficient with the camera.  By the way, the instruction manual is well over 150 pages, and it does a mostly adequate job of introducing the camera controls to the operator.  Still, it has taken me several weeks of use and review to learn the camera's many features and then remember them so that the operations are automatic.The pictures I have taken are very pleasing.  One can shoot in low light, bright light and all conditions in-between.  A flash is available and pops up automatically if desired for additional light.  This camera takes excellent pics in low-light conditions.The lens that comes with the camera is acceptable and I am pleasd with the sharpness of the images produced.  Other reviewers have stated that compared to fixed focal length lenses, such as the 50 mm, the variable zoom lens is not as sharp.  My view is that the lens provided is very adequate for virtually all applications, however, if the operator wants the very sharpest images possible, especially for portrait work, then perhaps a fixed focal length lens is beneficial.  I purchased a EF-S 28-135 IS lens for a telephoto zoom, and am happy with it.  Again, the quality of the zoom does not approach that of the Canon "L" series lenses, but then how many consumers can afford a single lens that is over $4,000 dollars?  From my perspective as an amateur that shoots a lot of images, I think the 20D is more than adequate for my needs.I highly recommend this camera to any amateur photographer that seeks a highly versitile top-quality camera that is a definite cut above the rest.  If you can afford this camera, buy it.  It will give you the creative options a photographer desires in a camera, and will give years of pleasure.Jim "Konedog" Koenig

$review_text.: I think this is a decent and inexpensive mouse, especially considering the fact that it has a fourth button that can be customized to do a number of things. It was plug-and-play on both a Mac with Snow Leopard and a PC with Windows XP, however I assume to get the fourth button working on Windows I would have needed to install the included software (unlike on OS X which let me configure it in System Preferences without any extra software). If you're left-handed, of course, you might not get as much benefit from the button because it'd be a little hard to reach.It's fairly comfortable to use and works well. There's slightly more traction than I would like between the mouse and my mousepad, but it's not the end of the world. The scroll wheel however is kinda weird: It has a lot of resistance when you turn it, but if you spin it a few times it acts like it has almost no resistance.
$SUMMARY.: Works well if you're right-handed, but scroll wheel is kind of odd

$review_text.: Ok, it's just a plug strip, nothing to gush over. But it is well designed and having one socket with a flipped direction is handy. The price seemed reasonable. I bought two of these to replace some aging ones I owned, and will probably buy more. They come with a good equipment protection guarantee, but I have never tried to collect on it.

$REVIEW.: Based upon previous reviews, it does fit fairly snugly, provides adequate body protection as described. I only gave 3 stars because, it is a little difficult to attach or switch lenses while it is in place. The cover over the flash shoe is clumsy when trying to attach an external flash. All operating buttons/shutter covered and accessible, but I had difficulties in two areas: (1) because the entire Pro Skin is black, all the button function lettering also is black so unless you have all the function buttons memorized, it is nearly impossible to read the button functions especially in dim lighting situations and difficult to make adjustments quickly. (2) This may just apply to me, but I found it particularly troublesome when trying to push the shutter as I could not feel the actual pressure when attempting to lock focus when pressing the shutter button halfway. I will probably keep the item, using it only as a protective cover when packed in my bag while traveling, but will remove it when in the field and actually shooting (I might also keep it handy in case of rain or other inclement weather).

$review_text.: Monster Digital 240 GB Daytona Series 2.5-Inch SATA 6 GB/s Solid State Drive / B008VD4TRSThis is my first SSD, and I absolutely love it. It took about 15 minutes to install in my Alienware computer. We setup the drive through the Windows Disk Management system, and that was a little fidly as it needed a Windows Update before the drive would work. Though this is a 240 GB drive, it effectively has only about 223 GB (which I believe is a pretty normal delta).The write speeds are incredible: I moved a 170 GB folder on my older drive and the estimated move time was 3 hours (and I know from experience it would have been even longer). The SSD drive was able to move the same 170 GB in under an hour (about 50 minutes), which was delightfully impressive. I've been using the drive for weeks and have seen no slow-down of the speed, so I couldn't be happier. The only downside that I can see is that these are still very pricey.NOTE: This review is based on a free Advance Review Copy of this product provided through Amazon Vine.~ Ana Mardoll

$review_text.: I got this mouse to replace a generic mouse that came with my HP Desktop Computer a few years ago.  The generic mouse lasted for a few years, but eventually went on the fritz and was losing the connection to the receiver, even after replacing the batteries.  I did some research to look for a new mouse knowing I didn't need too many bells and whistles.  This one fit the bill nicely.  It has regular buttons, thumb buttons and a roller with a button.  All standard stuff.  One unique thing is that the wheel button also clicks left and right, essentially making it three buttons in one.  You can also download free Logitech SetPoint software which allows you to program all the buttons to do just about anything you want.  That is a nice feature.  My only problem was getting the sensitivity right.  I was having trouble with the Win 7 Mouse settings where I couldn't get a good balance on the mouse movement.  It seemed too fast or too slow.  I used the SetPoint software to adjust that also which made it better.  It really just took a little while to get used to the new mouse movement.  The quality of the mouse is great with good tracking.  The USB receiver is tiny and doesn't get in the way of anything.  Overall it is a good mouse and does the job with a lot of ways to customize it through the software.  Recommended if you are looking for a standard mouse for your computer.

$review_text.: My last protector did its job...and died.  So I went looking for a quick replacement that wasn't too expensive.  After reading the other reviews on this product, I clicked order.  I received the unit in just a couple of days. Brand new in good packaging.  Looks to be very durable.  Some reviews talked about the tightness of the outlets.  Yes, it was a lttle harder to get things plugged in, but I find that to just be an additional security measure for them not coming loose if the unit gets bumped around.  My only reason for not giving 5 stars - my previous unit had each of the outlets marked for what it contained.  That made it easy to tell which plug you need when unplugging a device.  However, that was not a deal breaker and overall I'm happy with the purchase.

$review_text.: The wall mount is made in China - like most cheap things we buy.  The bolts on it will break off if you use them.  Buy stronger bolts, and put a little soap on the threads before trying to run them into the studs in your wall.  Otherwise it will not matter the type of bolt unless you purchase a Grade 8 bolt.  If the mount sags, then you are putting too big of a TV on it.  I put a 24 inch LCD TV on it, and it works fine.  Those who complained about the sagging should have probably spent an extra $10 to get a stronger bracket.

Since I've had problems with some Kingston memory, I decided that Lexar was the way to go - this being my 3rd thumb drive.

$REVIEW.: I was very happy using one of these cards with Comcast Basic Cable and Windows media player to record HD shows from the basic channels. It worked so well I had just bought a 2nd card so I could record 4 channels at once. Mainly the Big 4.It was nice to see the FCC made Cable providers have to deliver local stations unencrypted so we could get local channels for news, emergency alerts and some entertainment without being gouged for every thing these cable companies provide.Wow, things have changed though.... Sorry Avermedia and Amazon. It was great while it lasted.FCC leadership must be getting a kickback for letting companies like Comcast encrypt everything now. That makes these QAM tuners obsolete for many of us that are too far from getting any Over the Air signals.  Even the Cable boxes convert to the old channel 3, rather than just unencrypt the signals. Also making the built in QAM TV tuners useless. Unless you have a cable card ready set. AND, In two years, they can start charging us for the BASIC tuner rentals too.Time to cut the cable and watch the stream.At least water is still free and safe.  Oh wait.... Here comes Fracking....

$REVIEW.: Update: I forgot to mention that my motherboard does not have Sata 6 so My max speed is based on Sata 3
I am sure this would perform even faster if your motherboard has sata 6


I am happy though :)I bought this hard drive because of the amount of good reviews both here AND on newegg
I wanted to replace an old 74GB raptor 10000 rpm I had which was decent and had a windows experience index of 5.8 (i dont use that as a benchmark, just for reference)

but was getting old and I wanted the speed...I ran crytsldiskmark as a benchmark on the raptor to compare with the SSD
I will just post the sequential read/write speeds although everything was amazing
The raptor had 53.77 MB/s read and 55.31 write

Its not bad considering this is a 5 year old drive

I researched its numbers online and I believe when new it should be 63 read and 62.5 write

So my drive has a bit of wear and tear but its holding up ok.Well the SSD came up with 219.8 MB/s read and 111.0 write
thats a 400% increase in read speed and a 200% increase write speed

On other comparisons


Boot time was on average 1 minute and 36 seconds (to desktop) with raptor and now on average 36 seconds with ssd


Same programs and drivers installed


Also as I mentioned I use the windows 7 experience index for reference


It went from 5.8 to 7.3
If this isnt enough info to convince you to buy this drive, I dont know what is


Its the best value for speed and size for a main hard drive.Finally i would like to point out something in case anyone does not know...DO NOT defragment this drive

I researched it to be sure and found several sites and forums advising against it and i agree
Fragmentation will slow up your typical drive and a defrag is good to speed things up, however this drive reports a 39% fragmentation and still outperforms any other mechanical hard drive.

It was $599, which is amazing for this size and quality TV


We were a little worried about it being damaged in shipping, but amazon offered upgraded special shipping where they actually set up a delivery time and brought it into the house and set it up and made sure it worked which was nice


The picture is very good and the TV is easy to work
The only reason for 4 stars is during the day the light causes a pretty bad glare on the screen, but we mainly watch TV after dark so it's not too big of a problem
I definitely recommend this TV.

$REVIEW.: This has to be the best cooler per dollar you can buy. The mounting is a little tricky, but with patience, any one can master it.  My CPU ( a 3770) runs 20 degrees cooler than with the stock cooler.  It's enough cooler for any usage short of extreme overclocking.It's also relatively quiet. Less noise than the stock.  No rattles at all, just a gentle fan noise.The only con is that the fan seems flimsy.  Now it does work, but it seems like it's not going to last.  The mounting is easy, so if it does fail, it's simple to replace.The cooler is big, so do check those dimensions before you buy.

$review_text.: So I ordered this card as a replacement for my Gt 520 after it stopped working there were new reviews concerning this product at the time but because the price was so low ($25) shipped i decided to get it. The next day after my order shipped a review was posted and to my disappointment it was a 1 star review from a verified purchaser who was not descriptive as to why they disliked it. So I decided that I would write a review that was constructive concerning the product. First to start the card is great and is a much need improvement compared to my old GT520 which also only had 1gb of memory. This card has 2gb which from my research was not very applicable because this card supposedly could not utilize it. Well after testing it, it does in fact use all 2gb. I tested playing the sims 3 with many expansions at the highest settings, and there was absolutely no lag. Also I tested with skyrim, and it recommended "Very high" settings, which also played very well. The card cools fast and works well with two monitors (26 inch and a 20 inch). It does take up two slots in your motherboard, so make sure you have space for it. I had to remove my usb 3.0 card to get it to fit. Most people should be fine. Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.

$review_text.: The Belkin F7D4501 is a good product, despite all the reviews on here. However, I cannot negate the validity of the other reviews because, they are all true and the product was a pain to setup. First of all, you MUST have Windows 7, which may throw people for a loop when an XP users buys this, thinks they'll be setup in no time, then spends hours scratching their head. So, remember, you MUST have Windows 7, which is why I said it would be a great product next year by the time that Windows 7 because and old format that XP users then upgrade to.Anther thing, you must check to see if you have an Intel Wireless Display or you are out of lick as well. I did however get it to work with my wife's brand spanking new laptop. Good for her, bad for me because I wanted to use it with my laptop in my office. I will keep the Belkin and when I get a new laptop, which will be soon, I'll be good to go.However, I'd be MUCH happier if Belkin would soup this wireless unit up a bit to be used with smart phones and tablets so you could just use your Netflix app and wirelessly watch your programs on your television via iPhone.

It is definitely handy to have a real keyboard when you're typing more than just a few lines of text, so I use this keyboard when posting to forums, responding to detailed e-mails, or taking notes at meetings

So far, the only difficulty that I have experienced with it, is that the space bar did not work in the Google Chrome app; however, it's been a while since I've tried using it, so this problem may have been resolved through an app update


The keyboard has a micro-USB port for charging, so it hooks up to just about any other charger I have, and I've never run through my entire battery in the course of a day
I am very pleased with this keyboard.

$review_text.: I really, really wanted to like this light but it fell way short of my expectations. I liked its compact design and it seems to be made well. I can't attest to its durability since I probably won't be using it. In another review, I raved about the Mighty Bright XtraFlex2 book light. The Kandle doesn't even come clost to the Mighty Bright in illumination or adjustability. I own the Kindle 3 (latest generation) and thought the Kandle would light up the entire screen. It doesn't, so can understand why those with the Kindle 1 and DX owners don't particularly like this light. The brightness falls off considerably about 3/4 of the way down on my 6" screen which isn't acceptable. If the light head assembly could be pulled out perhaps another inch, I think the Kandle would illuminate the screen much better.Pros:Small size and portabilityPleasing designCons:price is excessive for what it islack of full screen illuminationavailability/price of CR2032 batteries if traveling

$REVIEW.: A solid wireless desktop. Has most of the bells and whistles that you might want.The mouse is very big. I would recommend trying it out in a retail store to get a feel for it. The keyboard is enormous and heavy. However, it does have a very nice wrist pad built in, and is great for typing.The bluetooth adapter is small, and uses the windows bluetooth stack. I did not use the adapter, since I already have one. I did not experience any lag with the keyboard or mouse, contrary to what other reviewer reported (I think this is purely a placebo effect on their part). I have not used it long enough to comment on the battery life.

$REVIEW.: This drive is a little chattery and seems to be very fast.  It has enough memory for anything I could ever dream up.  I upgraded my Dell XP desktop 512 meg mother board memory to 2 gig which suits the drive and XP just fine.  Amazon packing was poor but the price was right.  The WD drive box bounced from side to side inside the outer Amazon box due to zero side cushioning by Amazon.  Fortunately there are hard plastic end spacers inside the WD box.  When I power down the PC the drive makes sort of a growl when it apparently goes into parked position.  Installing the drive as a replacement main drive for me was more or less simply plug and play.

No matter where I went inside the house or out, upstairs or main floor, with the antenna or without, it never did anything.Darn.

$REVIEW.: I was a bit disappointed at first with this charger
I had been searching for solar chargers when this popped up, and didn't read the description carefully enough to see that this isn't a solar charger
Almost sent it back, but because of it's size, decided to hang onto it
 I can get quite a few half charges on my iPhone with one full charge on this thing
I use a wall adapter to charge it, and it takes about 8 hours to charge
 It does NOT charge my iPad 3

When plugged into my iPad, it keeps the iPad battery from draining any further, but does not charge it during use

You might get a slight charge if you're not using your iPad, but I definitely wouldn't buy this to charge one


Works great with my iPhone, and the size makes it extremely portable
Comes with a nice bag for storing also.

$review_text.: A few years my OEM battery on my Late 2008 MacBook got all bloated and fat.  The trackpad could not click because of it and the lid was kind of out of place.  I took it to a Genius at an Apple store to see if I can get it replaced for free, but was turned down. Decided to remove the battery and just run without it since I mainly use my machine at home. Well, it is PITA to have it without a battery inside it so I needed a battery replacement.The ones from Apple are 129 plus tax, kind of expensive if you ask me.  So I decided to look elsewhere.  I bought one from eBay and it was really cheap and it didn't even work at all.  When I shook the battery it hard some rattling inside it. I immediately returned that garbage back to the seller.  So I was skeptical about getting another non OEM one but after seeing all the positive reviews on this Anker one I decided to take my chances.Great battery.  It feels solid and fits inside just like the OEM one.

Those were incredibly cheaply built, did not have polarized plugs.  They did power the camera, but cause horrible interference on anything else plugged into the same outlet.The second was the Eurus/HQRP power adapter for sale here for about half the price (item B000FPWRAQ).  It was DOA.  So I finally decided to bite the bullet and get an OEM adapter.This works perfectly.  It's solidly built.  No problems, got 2 and both work great.

$REVIEW.: I would rate the Firestick antenna as a 5 but their website could have been better and so I gave them a 4 overall.The Firestick II was part of the new CB rig that I setup on my Jeep Wrangler (JK) unlimited sport 4 door.  Before buying an antenna I did some studying and research on the proper method of installation and the importance of the correct equipment.  I was led to the Firestick web site where they have a wealth of information that one could learn from.  My previous (8 years ago) CB rig used a magnetic mount antenna and it came with the CB.  I knew very little about the different types of antenna and knew nothing about the need to use a SWR meter for a CB.  Friends that have had two meter rigs used a SWR meter but I never knew that CB required adjustment.And so that is what was great about the Firestick web site.  They kept it simple enough that I did not need to understand radio wave theory to learn how best to install the cable, mount and antenna.  The only additional thing that I would have liked on their website would have been to have some pictures of various installations along with explanations of what works best.  The saying that a picture is as good as a 1000 words is correct.But on to the subject of the antenna.  I thought about getting the 3ft antenna but opted for the 4ft antenna instead.  I mounted it to the spare tire carrier with a Rugged Ridge antenna mount.  With the quick disconnect and spring it sticks about 3ft above the top of the soft top on my Jeep.  I followed their instructions and went with a separate ground line and verified the electrical power was clean.  The coax cable, quick disconnect and spring all came from Firestick.  Upon power up for the first time I calibrated the SWR meter and tested the system.  On Channel 1 the SWR was 1.3 but it went up to 1.6 on Channel 40, suggesting that the antenna is electrically too long.  Therefore, the beauty of an antenna that was top loaded and has an adjustment screw.  With some trial and error I was able to get it adjusted so that the SWR readings for all channels ranged from 1.15 to 1.3.  I had to remove the brass lock nut to get it set just right.  It is amazing how little things affect the SWR.  Just for testing I measured the SWR with the spare tire swing gate open and closed.  With it closed I was able to keep it below 1.3 on all channels.  With it open the SWR went up to 1.8.  I have not tried it with the soft top down but I do expect some differences since the soft top frame is only 6 inches from the antenna with the top up and it would be below the antenna when the top is down.The antenna is build strong and you can tell that the workers that made it took pride in their work.
$SUMMARY.: Firestick II is impressive for the price

I travel a lot, so nothing stinks more than landing in a hotel with wired internet only, or pay for wireless.This thing is easily set up, and once you plug in the ethernet wire -- boom, your own little network. Not only that, but like I said, its fully configurable -- use it to extend a wireless network, add it to make your printer wireless, whatever you want.  I like just having it on hand just in case.One note for those wondering, this does not work with open source router software like DDRT.  Stinks, but for the cost I was ok with that.

Good battery life, lasting at about 10 hours per charge2

The oled screen has a good picture3


Small and compact.4


The 5 way tactile joystick creates  super easy one handed navigation (unless you have large thumbs).5

The user interface is super easy to get used to, it doesnt use silly symbols that expect you to know what they mean.6
The radio picks up in just about all places.7


You can browse photos or create a slide show while still listening to music.8

The voice recorder come in handy and has a nice sound.9


The inline recording works well.10
With its included features, for the price, its steal.Cons1
Converting videos can be a pain, even with the included software, and videos take up a ton of space.2


It can be hard to see the screen sometimes in the light.3
You can only charge it from a usb port unless you buy a usb to wall converter.Really the bottom line for this mp3 player is if you have $110and want a versitale and compact mp3 player with  a ton of features get the Zen V Plus.

$review_text.: I purchased these headphones from a T.J

Maxx for $20
That was 2 years ago and I've been happy ever since

They serve mostly as my home computer headphones for watching videos, playing games, and chatting with family
I have had no problems at all with this headset and don't foresee any

The cable length, being a generous 10 feet long, make them great for listening to a stationary device and still being able to retrieve nearby objects

I have also used them in portable MP3 players, CD players, and Radios


There has been no decrease in quality when going from device to device
The adjustable bracket isn't very necessary for my use, as unadjusted, they fit me just fine but they are great as a music player for babies in utero

I don't feel that these headphones are worth anything more then $20 and over that, you can find better quality.

$REVIEW.: First, let me say, I would have given this projector 4.5 stars if the rating was available
 Basically, it's a really good projector
 It has everything you need, and the picture quality and brightness is really good.However, this unit is really big and not just a little ugly


 I mean, I suppose the picture quality is the primary objective, but couldn't they have made it just a little prettier?It doesn't actually look that much worse than other units in shape, etc

 But it's huge, which makes the utilitarian appearance stand out
 Also, it's white
 Which means that if you want to use it as part of a home theater setup like me, it's more visible in a dark room.Ugly and more visible make a bad combination.I'm really happy with my projector

 I'm sure I'll get a lot of use and satisfaction from it

Unfortunately, there are a couple of caveats to note.First - the lens hood had to come off as it kept getting stuck in this bag's suspension mechanism.Second - the zipper runs from only one side, so trying to zip it up while the camera strap hangs out is less convenient. I'd have preferred two zippers that met in the middle.However, for the price, this is a decent camera case, and I expect to use it quite a bit.

$review_text.: The Google Chromecast definitely has a target audience


I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend since she does not have a SMART TV and was stuck watching Netflix and YouTube on her phone

The setup for the Chromecast was idiotproof in my experience and I had absolutely zero issues with it then (and continue to have zero issues)


It definitely has a target audience of those without SMART TV's but can still be useful to those who do have SMART TV's as you can control the streaming from your phone, and even stream a few more things to it than your SMART TV probably has apps for

Everyday use is far too easy to have any complaints about and even controlling it from multiple different devices (for example, adding YouTube videos to the queue) is not difficult at all


The best part, however, would be the ease of connecting your devices to it since, well, you don't have to! If your device is on the same Wi-Fi network as the Chromecast, it will automatically add in the &#34;cast&#34; button in to the supported apps
All in all, a great product that I would buy again if need ever arose.

 Unfortunately the new battery would only provide about 1 hour of video viewing before going dead
 I contacted the seller and was promptly sent a replacement

 The second battery offered approximately the same length of service before going dead


 The seller offered a full refund including free return shipping but at this point I had already discarded the original battery so if I were to return the new battery my Zune would be unusable, so 1 hour of use is better than no use.

$REVIEW.: Unless there are "generic" batteries that I just haven't found out about yet, I have been very unimpressed by the generic batteries that I've purchased for use in my Canan Powershot camera.The one I currently have, for example, made by "Premium Tech", fits Canon NB-41, stinks, for lack of a better word.  It may have been ok for a few weeks.  But that's it.  Then it's pure frustration thereafter.  After a recharge, it will show on your camera that it is "fully charged" but will "conk out" within seconds.  Turn it back on, and again, the battery indicator says "full", but it blacks out after 10-20 seconds every time.  What a joke.  Junk.My Canon battery, by contrast, which came with the camera 4 years ago, has been used FAR more times (by the thousands) and still keeps a charge very well.  It's really not even a discussion, as far as I'm concerned.  The generic battery was a waste of money, and a big frustration too, when it fails on you in the middle of something right after a "recharge".

$REVIEW.: This Seagate Wireless Plus 1TB Mobile Device Storage with Built In Wifi is fantastic.  My needs are simple--loading a few songs, a few movies, a few of my own video projects to show view/listen to on my iPod Touch.  Sadly, there is no app available for my tablet (which doesn't have access to a true 'android marketplace'), but I'm sure I'd use this to pull media up on that if I could!  I'm not going to get overly technical for this review because I'm not that kind of girl, but I will go into a few pro's and con's.Pros:-It's a nice size.  This is small enough to fit well in most computer case pockets and light enough that it won't drag you down.  It's design is pretty sleek-- black and smooth with an on switch and a blue light that flashes to let you know when you're logged on.-It's 1TB.  That's a lot of space for the normal computer user.  For me, I love the idea of storing video on here.  I personally dislike having video on my mobile devices b/c of the space involved, but this helps curtail that!-The speed of the streaming video and music is really nice.  I didn't have to wait at all for most of the videos I tested this with.  The music, as well, played on my mobile device rather quickly.-It works on mac and pc!  Now, I must admit, I always have trouble with Seagate on my Mac and I did with this one at first, too, but once I figured out that I needed to change my wireless network to the special Seagate network, it worked perfectly.Cons:-The instructions aren't very good.  I wish they'd come with something slightly more user friendly.-I have phantom files in my iPod app.  I deleted them on the drive after testing them on various mobile devices, but they insist on still showing up in my app. They don't open, of course, but the thumbnail is still there.  That is a bit annoying, as I haven't figured out how to delete those yet and don't want them clogging up the screen.-I would have loved a little more protection on the outer case.  As I mentioned, it's a nice size, but I would have liked a little more 'something' to protect this a bit more from falls or damage.Despite the few flaws I found, I actually really like the idea of this and it works well enough for my needs.  This device will definitely come in handy!

$REVIEW.: Let's face it, most people want a camera that is easy to use. This was my first criterion in looking for a digital camera. But I didn't want to compromise on much else either: megapixels, flash flexibility, close focusing, size and weight. This camera can be used right out of the box, with plainly labeled buttons and knobs. But I tried all the features too, like zoom, no flash, night photography, close-ups, mixed lighting. My results show that this camera has the right mix of technology and ease of use. The software to bring the pictures to my Mac was also simple. The video recording capability was fairly good - not tape quality but lots of fun. Be sure to buy a 256MB memory card to supplement the 32 MB installed. I can take 500 good quality photos with the one chip. My 8x10 prints were super! Let this be your next camera.

$REVIEW.: Well, a lot to like and not like about this camera.  My previous camera was a wonderful Sony dcr-trv30..LOVED IT! Filmed for 10 years with it, a joy to work with -only it used dv tapes and only 720 quality picture. So, time to upgrade.  Let me begin with that as an amature, you will most likely find the CX560v very worthwhile. However, if like me, a semi-pro using it often, think carefully before investing in this product.For some odd reason, the industry seems to think that smaller is better; maybe for traveling? Sony also thinks we have small fingers and really good eyesight and can manage with a 3" screen. A few gripes are as follows: If you film on auto, the faces are too bright/washed out from a distance -use the assignable wheel and be ready to adjust-always. The touch screen will get oily and is messy. The assignable wheel in front of viewfinder would have been better in back and not so extremely sensitive. The 3" screen is downsized from previous model -why? Why must everything these days be made smaller? I am semi-pro videographer and expect to see the people large enough to adjust exposure, etc. The shoe mount for external mic/light is recessed into camera, so my RODE mic will not slide in. My old Sony remote tripod will not work with this camera, must buy new Sony proprietory tripods. The built in usb cable is so short, practically worthless, need extension. Must have screen open or it will shut off. No viewfinder, forget about bright outdoor filming. So many misses with this one. Love Sony products and it frustrates me that they skimp on the important features to give gimmicks like GPS, why? If anybody will ever use this, let me know. All I want is large viewing screen, gradual adjustable iris, a useable shoe, better than 10x zoom(this camera does have digital zoom, but it is phoney and gets grainy, they all do) Is it that tough? You can keep your photo capability(even at 12mp doesn't come close to a slr quality), gps, smart movie, on-board editing software and save the public a bundle. Better to buy previous model, cx550v, it had 3.5"screen and shot in only 1080i, but really folks, if you shoot for highest 1080p, compressing it to a dvd will negate the quality in picture anyway, even on a bluray (if it is a long video). So, hope this helps. If you got the bucks, check into Canon video cameras, they have larger screen sizes though cost a bit more but only have 32GB. I have owned this camera just for a month or two-will post more as the learning curve allows.Well, after enjoying this little camera for a little over 2 years now, the adjustable dial in front has stopped working. I can longer adjust the exposure or Iris so this camera can only be used on 'auto'. Hugely disappointed in Sony quality standards. Will never buy a Sony again. Will stick with Canon products.
$SUMMARY.: Small screen, gps, proprietory shoe, why Sony, why?

$review_text.: I've been using these for about a week now, and I am very pleased! They give great sound, thanks to being able to adjust the levels of the desk speakers vs. the subwoofer (which I have on the floor, 4' behind the desk) via the remote control. I LOVE having the remote control! I especially like the fact that it's wired, so no matter how messy my desktop gets, I can always follow the cord to find the remote (lol.) Being able to easily turn off the subwoofer and the satellite speakers (via the simple push button on the remote) will undoubtedly save on power consumption, small though that may be. I also like the way the bottoms of the satellite speakers have a non-skid coating. The previous speakers I had used to slide off the desk all the time, and eventually broke because of that. No such worries now!My only complaint is that even though there are small raised lines on the volume controls of the remote, I wish that each one would have at least one REALLY raised line, to make it easier to make any adjustments. Right now, my fingers tend to slip off them, so something raised up higher would help with that. Aside from that minor problem, I really couldn't be more pleased with this set of speakers, especially at such a modest price!I think I should add that I consider myself to be an audiophile, and if there had been any hiss at all, or pops, or anything bad, I would have noticed them and send them back right away! I use my computer to watch movies and play CDs - all kinds of music, everything from classical to pop - so it is very important to me to achieve a clean sound on my speakers. In the past, I spent over $300. to achieve decent sound. I never thought I could get anything close to that for well under $100, but I have now, thanks to this set!

$review_text.: This case is much better than I expected, it fits like a glove and feels awesome.  The radio feels even better in my hand when in this case than it did.  It is a molded rubber case so yes, you have to roll it back to remove the battery or access the charging pins.  I wouldn't want it any other way, it would not do a good job of covering and protecting the radio if this area was left open.  I buy a ton of stuff from Amazon and this is honestly one of the best items I have ever purchased.

$REVIEW.: Picture quality and sound (via headphones) were pretty good.  Liked the screen size.  However, after one day of use in the car one of the units stopped playing and constantly flashed &#34;Open/Load DVD&#34;.  The DVD was loaded properly (I checked it several times) and the case was closed properly (opened and closed it several times just to be sure.)  So, we had one very happy kid with a DVD that worked, and another who had to while away the time in the car the old fashioned way - by looking out the window.I also felt that the units seemed very plasticky and of cheap construction.  I returned them the day after we finished our road trip.

The metal construction feels solid. Screwing the camera into the mechanism to attach to the tripod eliminates any risk of the camera falling. Very safe!We also like the levels at the upper hand of the tripod as they helped us align the camera horizontally.The handle at the top allows us to follow the players on the ice while maintaining the horizontal plan. If you pull in the handle harder the camera will move  along the vertical axis as well.Great tripod for the price.The only con is the weight of the tripod, a result of its solid construction.

$review_text.: I've found in business life, the more uses I can get out a single product, the more it deserves a place in my travel bag.  TheAerb Portable Wireless Bluetooth Keyboardis a great tool for a traveler especially those who use devices with no physical keyboard present that like the feel of real keys.This keyboard/mouse pad combo offer lots of great options for android and PC users.  I tested this unit with my Nexus 7 with great results.  In terms of size, the keyboard is about equal in size to most slide out keyboards on certain smartphones.  Apple, Android, and Windows; all the buttons you need to get the most out of the keyboard are right there.  This keyboard has an internal rechargeable battery and is recharged with the include USB cable.The keyboard/mouse combo really help keep things packed tightly on the go.  The unit is compact and easy to store for travel.  It turns on easy with the slide switch up top and pairs just like any other typical Bluetooth device.  This product features a back-lit keyboard, making it awesome for a dark ride on the train or a dark plane; it's also perfect for overhead presentation when you may have the lights in the conference room off.  I used this keyboard for a presentation I had last week and found it overly useful and much more versatile than a typical slide clicking remote.Overall, theAerb Portable Wireless Bluetooth Keyboardis a good buy considering price and function.  Though made of plastic, the unit is durable and works really great.  It appears there are several varieties available on this product page so you can choose color and design you most like.  For the frequent traveler and presenters, this is a fantastic product and thoroughly recommended.Disclosure: I received a sample product from the manufacturer for the purposes of providing this review.

The only reason it gets four stars instead of five is that the auto power feature on my iPad Air doesn't always work with this case. It always powers on when I open the case, but it doesn't always power off when I close it. It's a minor thing for me as I have my iPad set to power off at a short enough interval that it doesn't drain my battery.

$REVIEW.: I bought these ear phones yesterday from Best Buy. I had a rewards coupon for $35.00.  Usually I use the Bose MIE2i Earphones but they were starting to sound like static.  I have had them for a long time so I was probably due for new ones. I have had my eye out on the Bose noise-canceling (299.00) but my daughter wanted a new IPad so I sacrificed for her. As I was talking to the Associate I asked him for his opinions on alternative earphones. He listed a few and then mentioned these  Monster Intensity are nice headphones, sound quality is great. Since I couldnt use the coupon on the iPad due to other discounts, I figure I would give it a try for the price after rewards coupon. Tried them last night because I wanted to listen to my ipod during sleep and I had a hard time getting the ear buds to stay in my ear so I decided to put the smallers covers on. Stayed in my ear better but after 10 mins - and I mean literally after 10 mins - my upper left ear was starting to become sore!! I was like &#34;No way! Really??&#34;. So I watched a tutorial online from the Monster site to make sure I was putting them on correctly. I dunno.. I got them in but during the night all I felt was pain in both ears!! More like a soreness but it hurt!! And they kept falling out which was very annoying. So as my recommendation, if you have Bose or considering them and can afford them - Go for it!! They are so much more comfortable, no pain and can hardly tell they are in your ear. Sound quality in very good especially when using during phone calls. Plus no pain when sleeping on either side of my ear on the pillow. I plan to get the Bose noise canceling next pay day and hope those ear buds are just as comfortable as the Bose MIE2i Mobile Headset. Good Luck!!

I ended getting a pair of super cheap koss kph6 / ur5 (it comes with an extra set of foam ear pads) and the pads fit my px100 perfectly!

 I have 5 fans in this case (three fans that came with the case, plus two on my CPU), and the lot of them combined don't make as much noise as one of these
 They're not jet engines, but its noticeable even while wearing my headset
 The airflow is iffy, I don't have an anemometer to measure actual air flow, but after installing them I had difficulty telling which side the air was blowing out of because so much was blowing back out the intake (they don't come tabled with arrows so I had to guess based on the fan blade shape)

 Ended up disconnecting them and I'm going to look for some nice Noctua fans.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this camera bag as an in-between sized bag for my Nikon D7000 DSLR camera
 It is perfectly sized to hold my Nikon D7000 fitted with a Nikon 16-85 zoom lens, the camera's charging system, and a second lens of equal physical size to the 16-85 (or smaller)
 The bag is just big enough to hold the D7000 fitted with the Nikon 70-300 VR zoom lens (and the 16-85 as well), but it is a fairly tight fit
 I use this bag as my go-to hiking kit
 The bag has belt loop straps in the back that I actually use to clip to the chest strap of my backpack

 It is a little cumbersome if any climbing is necessary, so in those conditions, I just slip the whole camera bag into the large compartment of my backpack

 If not climbing, "hanging" the Lowepro off the front of my pack provides easy access to my camera, while keeping it safe from the bumps and leaving my hands free for hiking poles - without a camera swinging to-and-fro as I travel in rough country

 For reference, the hikes that I take are substantial - I have taken this camera kit on about 10 different hikes to the summits of 14000 ft peaks in Colorado..


and captured some very nice shots along the way that would just not have been possible if I had my camera stashed away inside my backpack
 By the time I had taken off my backpack and gotten out my camera the shots would no longer be available to take (big horn sheep, mountain goats, and the like)

 Highly recommended!

$REVIEW.: I installed a pair of these as an alternative to a wireless bridge to get network connectivity in a distant corner of my home (relative to the router). I was initially skeptical, and I understand that the details of your home wiring does matter. I was apparently lucky, I get essentially the maximum speed my connection allows all the time, which is a surprising step up from the okay-but-not-great wifi coverage I was getting.I give this four stars over five for two reasons. First, these only come in pairs. I need three, and it's annoying I can't buy a single additional unit. The second reason is that it's not quite as simple as advertised. The paper manual is an ikea style step by step picture pamphlet, which may not be the best idea for network hardware. You may as well just skip to the pdf on the CD, the thing that got me was that you have to push the button within two minutes, but you also need to hold them down for less than three seconds, until the power LED flashes. Once I knew the trick and got them set up, they've been great.

$REVIEW.: I guess I shouldn't have been surprised at how terrible the sound quality is on these headphones, and why they only ship from overseas and why you can only seem to find them in one or two places. The drivers in these headphones are simply too tiny to reproduce sound with any clarity or fidelity whatsoever. Yes, they are extremely thin and small and light, so I guess if those are your only criteria these might work well for you. But you will not be happy or even satisfied with the sound quality. There is zero bass response and everything sounds terrible, maybe except for basic spoken word like podcasts. I also didn't like the fold-out ear holder mechanism. It doesn't work as well as other wrap-around style headphones and these headphones feel like they're going to fall off while you're moving. Just stay away from these and look for something else because they're a waste of time.

$REVIEW.: I needed a sleeve for my iPad 2 (with back cover & smart cover) that would fit nicely and provide some protection so I could put the iPad in my purse or bag when I travel. This sleeve is PERFECT for that.  The iPad, with both covers, fits nicely within the sleeve and is adequately protected. The zipper is heavy duty and I love it that it has a dual zipper pull. This sleeve offers a perfect size and fit for the iPad 2.I highly recommend this sleeve if you are wanting to put your iPad in a purse, bag or backpack to take where ever you go.

$review_text.: I have already been owning an iPad for one and half year and I needed a smaller tablet to bring with me during my frequent travels and especially with a front camera to videocall home via Skype.The need for the camera was the strong requirement that unfortunately prevented me from buying the new Kindle Fire. So I opted for the Dell Streak. I wanted a 7" and I wanted good performing processor. I considered the Samsung Galaxy Tab P1000 or P1010 and the Dell Streak 7, same price range and same 7" size. On Amazon I found good reviews for both and read about the Galaxy better screen and better battery life but from my perspective I preferred to value the dual core Cortex-A9 Tegra2 processor in the Dell instead of the single core Cortex-A8 in the Galaxy and I also valued the upgrade to HoneyComb for the Dell, not available for the Galaxy.So I bought the Dell Streak 7". I initially bought a used/refurbished one to stay on the cheap side but it failed to boot up, it kept on looping on some Dell logo then full black, then back Dell logo until it hanged and I needed to press the reset button. I sent it back to Amazon, which refunded me immediately and even provided a pre-paid UPS pick-up service. Excellent!I then opted for a new Dell Streak 7", just 30$ more than the used one and I got it the next day.It works nicely and I like the form factor. And it automatically upgraded immediately from Gingerbread to HoneyComb, the latest Android release. Skype video calls work reliably and I can also easily switch between the front and rear cameras. I do like the pictures taken with the rear 5Mpxl camera.I like web browing and email clients and I do like the HoneyComb GUI.Now the negative facts:- battery life is not good. I can keep my iPad in stand-by for two full weeks using it only in the evenings and week end. I cannot on the Dell, the battery drains out in few days of stand-by. I have even tried to configure the wifi power management to switch off when the screen goes off, instead of staying on during the day for regular updates. But it does not help much. I guess the reviews in Amazon comparing the Galaxy and the Dell were true about battery life!- the screen resolution is not optimal for HoneyComb. I guess that HoneyComb is working on some 1024x768 and then gets downsized to the 800x600 of the Dell. Or something like this. It is clear because the text in emails or web pages is not sharp, especially small fonts, it is full of grey around and does not look nice. This is the well-known effect of anti-aliasing, all those artificial grey shades from black to white to fake your eye and try and show more pixels than they are available on the real screen. I guess the reviews in Amazon comparing the Galaxy and the Dell were true about better screen on the Galaxy! Please note that the screen is anyway excellent for ebook reading with both the Kindle sw client and my favourite BlueFire reader!- during my first two weeks of use of the Dell and right after the update to HoneyComb, the Dell has hanged up twice and I have had to use the hidden reset button. It has not happened anymore, I do not know if there has been some further update in background. It seems to be hopefully stable now.- when switching away from the web browser and moving back to the desktop, or when starting a new application like the email client, everything hangs for maybe up to 2s, it seems the platform is busy doing something heavy. Then it becomes responsive again. Maybe 512MB of RAM is not enough?- I have not found many games in the Android Market, there are more available for the Android phones - I have a Nexus One - I guess developers have not invested much in HoneyComb. Who knows if Dell will bring IceScream Sandwich to the Streak? that would possibly solve the lack of apps.- it has been a real pain to install the USB drivers and connect the Streak to my Windows XP laptop. It was simply not getting recognised. I have luckly found good info from Google. I had first to update to Windows Media Player 11 and then hack manually into the MTP configuration file in some windows directory and manually add one line with some USB vendor/product ID. It seems that if you run Windows Vista or Windows 7, the Dell connects immediately and is recognised easily so the problem comes from my old Windows XP set-up.So, in the end, how do I rate the Dell Streak 7? I find it outstanding value for money, I have a small compact tablet with up-to-date web browser, good ebook reader and Skype video call. So I am satisfied with my purchase and I would recommend it to my friends, of course being aware anyway of the limitations I am facing. Overall, the iPad is a totally different class of device and more than double the price, so you do get what you pay for. And the Dell fits the bill perfectly.
$SUMMARY.: excellent value for money but far from an iPad

$REVIEW.: I love this. Way better than the TomTom since you can have a case on your phone and be able to use it. The GPS doesn't seem to be more accurate, I could be wrong. The bluetooth speakerphone is poor. I never use it, you have to shout and put your ear up to the thing to listen. The volume also comes out of the unit unless you turn it down. When you get a call you'll have to turn the volume back up. I just use this to charge my phone in landscape mode basically. I do not have an AUX input so I use a FM transmitter when I want to listen to music. I just don't want to look down while driving.

 But after reading a thread in the Kindle Discussions, I pulled the tab up inside the cover a bit and really pushed the Kindle into the cover and it worked
 Now my Kindle stays put and doesn't fall out and I don't accidentally hit the next page button anymore
 Best of all, I can clip on the book light and read in bed

 I'm still only giving it 3 stars because I feel Amazon should have made a more user friendly design.

$review_text.: I bought THREE of these units because the size/price was good.  But unfortunately, I got what I paid for.  All three have the same problem:  when browsing the internet the browser constantly shuts down unexpectedly.  Nothing heavy - just searching with Google and average we surfing.  After a few minutes - it just shuts down the browser and returns to the home screen.  Only happens when you hold the device in portrait mode.  I can surf for 30+ minutes with no problem holding it in landscape mode.  But as soon as I rotate it to portrait mode, it only takes 3 or 4 more page loads and it shuts down.What is strange is - I thought it was just a crappy web browser on the device so I downloaded and tried 2 others from the app store.  All have the exact same problem.  Not sure what it is - but it is not the web browser.  Something about the device just cannot handle browsing in portrait mode.Since 95% of what I bought these for was web browsing - they are useless to me.  So I am returning them.

$REVIEW.: CONSTRUCTION: These headphones broke two days after I received them--about five minutes into a 5-hour plane ride to a fairly remote island with no stores selling headphones. Needless to say, I was upset. I will update this review if I attempt to act on their "1-year warranty".SOUND QUALITY: comparable to headphones under $10. Slightly better bass, but vocals sound muffled. In fact, I've tried $10 headphones that were much better in both sound quality and construction. Are they noise-isolating? barely--not enough to hear music on a subway ride (again, I've had cheap headphones I could actually use on a subway ride).FIT: design is awkward and uncomfortable--if you fall asleep listening to music, you can't sleep on your side. The design neither contributes to comfort nor sound isolation--it's pretty superfluous.HEADSET: the microphone is a tiny pinprick, bad quality as well. The only other feature is a button from which you can pause or play music--very rudimentary.BOTTOM LINE: These are just plain bad. I would heed the overwhelming amount of negative reviews (coincidentally, all rated uninformative by some vicious defender) and save your money. Don't think it's a steal when it changes to $14--they're not even worth that.

My real gripe is that the magnetic closure on/off function is not reliable. One time it works, the next it doesn't. If this feature is important to you, I'd skip this case.Apparently Poetic is responsive enough to customer feedback to monitor the reviews here. After I posted the above, Poetic contacted me to say they were sending me a newer version of the case. They did, and it does work flawlessly. I highly recommend it.

$REVIEW.: I am REALLY picky about electrical equipment, stereos, mp3 players, and sound quality.  This little thing is not meant to replace some awesome sound system. It's tiny.  It's not meant to replace really great quality headphones or earbuds (of course, most earbuds are crappy, including the ones that come with iPods).  But this little iHome portable speaker is truly amazing.  I have a number of smaller portable speakers by Altec Lansing.  This holds it's own against the ones I have that cost $100, except maybe cannot pump out as much volume.  I have been testing this in various ways.  The main reason I picked it up (didn't order it at Amazon, but I'll be getting some for friends at Amazon cause I buy most stuff here) was to try out with my wife's iPad on movies where the sound output level is annoying low (The Kings Speech download from iTunes has a mastered volume level that is just too low to listen well enough to on the iPad).  This little speaker solves that problem. It does not make the volume way louder but louder enough to make the difference when you want to watch a movie on the iPad and it's recorded or mastered low and you do not want to use headphones.Now, for what really impressed me and could make this a traveling companion I won't do without.  I played numerous songs on it, comparing the sound of this little speaker with the sound of my 15inch MacBook.  The sound on this little iHome is seriously better. Deeper, fuller sound, better bass response, and better mids by far.  Just an all around better audio listening experience than the MacBook by itself.I have not had this long enough to test battery life, but if it's adequate, this is a home run and crazy good for the cost.  I expected it to be useful; I didn't expect it to be great.ONE MORE THING FOR iPod USERS:  This is according to taste, of course, but I find that this little speaker has particularly good sound for playback from an iPod if you set EQ to "small speakers."  I've tried all the settings, and that, to my ears, produces the fullest, richest sound from these little speakers.
$SUMMARY.: You cannot believe how good this is for the price.  Amazing

$REVIEW.: This subwoofer has not only been a great addition to my home theater, it has also been an indispensable component of my gastrointestinal health. As an avid audio fan, I needed one of the best subwoofers to satisfy my love for bass. As a person who suffers from chronic constipation, I need a subwoofer so powerful, so gut wrenching, that it could actually achieve the famed "Brown Note" frequency. This subwoofer easily reaches the Brown Note and caused my body to immediately defecate and evacuate my two-week old backed up stool. Now instead of having a Code Brown at the hospital, I get to enjoy a Code Brown in the comfort of my own home.I almost cried out of happiness the first time it reached the Brown Note. I was about ready to go to the hospital for another digital evacuation. I instead decided to play some bass songs which almost immediately caused my rear end to forcefully vomit last week's meals. I reported my success with this subwoofer to my gastroenterologist, Dr. Pough, and he has since been subscribing this subwoofer to all of his patients. He actually went out of business a short time later because all of his patients were cured. He now sells these subwoofers out of his parents basement. I heard this subwoofer even cures diverticulitis. Who knew?!Anyways, if you want great bass and a clean colon at the same time, give this subwoofer a try.

$review_text.: Although I dislike buying something such as a bag online, the numerous pictures of people placing their expensive DSLR cameras into the top section with the lens attached made me comfortable with the idea. I am concerned that the zipper at the top of the bag would some day scratch the LCD screen on the back of myCanon Digital Rebel XSi 12.2 MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens (Black). On the plus side, the compartments hold the individual units, extra batteries, lens covers, and just about everything I can imagine.I wish it came with an instruction book on what the best way to carry a tripod with the 'tripod' straps would be, since its internal structure is padded yet not armored to the point where I wouldn't fear a flexing or bending of the bag due to the weight of a tripod. Still, anything is better than carrying a tripod on a shoulder strap or in one hand when climbing a mountain to get a great shot overlooking the Valley Of The Sun or Sonoran Desert, and I imagine not falling over due to imbalance will pay off. I imagine that once I start obtaining additional lenses and extra doodads, the rest of the pockets will really pay off.The best part about it is the price! The price of a "camera only" bag from Cannon tends to be more expensive than the full backpack. I am quite glad to have bought this, although I admit I have not taken it out for a real test. Considering I just spent all my money on an expensive camera, I feel safe knowing I am carrying it in this case on my desert adventures.

Whenever you zoom or change the subject during video recording, autofocus goes back and forth and frequently loses focus completely.Canon's 70D uses phase detection autofocus, and when I tested it, works very very well.And I thought as D610 is announced &#34;after&#34; 70D, it would incorporate the new phase detection autofocus, but it did not. Then I wondered &#34;why&#34; Nikon replaced D600 with D610 in such a hurry.... well, see the rest of the 1 star review....

$REVIEW.: The concept of having a compact, cap less device is great.  Patriot devices even work.  I commend the manufacturer for sealing it to afford water resistance; even after being washed in the laundry, the drive worked without a hitch once dried.But my principal gripe is that the Patriot's devices are not made per standardized specifications.  Patriot's grey Axles have a few bytes less memory than the reds, so directly copying an ext4 image from a 32GB red to 32GB grey is rendered impossible.  The reds are made with a mix of fast and slow chips, so some support 10MB/s xfers where others are around 1MB/s.  It is very frustrating that Patriot skimps on product QA for design control while valuing their products with great QC.

$REVIEW.: This protector does a good job for the most part, but I'd like to see a new version made. My suggestion is that they manufacturer should put a sticky strip along the bottom part. I say this because I use a CarrySpeed LCD viewfinder on my T2i. When I go to take it off, the magnetic frame is so strong that the bottom of the protector startes to flap up (letting dust underneath of it). Eventually, I think it will snap in half if I'm not careful (usually I'm careful).  Also I found that the protector wiggles a little bit if you intentionally want it to. It might not perfectly match how well the stock eyepiece fits on the body. No biggie, just saying. This is an affordable way to protect your T2i screen and a pretty good option for people that want to use LCD Viewfinders.

$REVIEW.: Had suffered with a Walkman and then a Shuffle (former too bulky and poor reception, latter no control)

 This is a perfect answer with good reception from the radio;  sound very good; buds comfortable; storage more than adequate; small and attractive; very good price
 Only negatives so far are that the clip broke off and that the battery recharge is not as advertised--about 5-10 hours


 I bought a two-year replacement warranty because something this good can't last!  (I thought well enough of it, just the same, to buy two more as gifts.)

But it happened again and I had had enough.  I put it in my desktop thinking it didn't like the server but after a couple months of use IT DID IT AGAIN!  All data was lost.  I am no longer going to use it for anything other than a pagefile drive.  At least if the pagefile goes Poof it's no big loss.  Overall this is my second disppointment with the Gigabyte brand (a Dead motherboard and now this).  Also this is not any noticeably faster than an SSD drive which holds a lot more data for the same price and is more reliable.

 Not having to use a USB dongle is a plus, and the wireless range is quite extensive - farther than you can read the laptop's monitor

 The center wheel is smooth in operations, and all button presses/clicks have a good tactile feel to them unlike some low end mice

 On/Off switch on the bottom prolongs battery life as there won't be an accidental activation while traveling

 Battery life is very good - I'm still on the initial battery.

Didn't really care about the speakers, but they are nice, including subwoofer. The space bar doesn't always pick up my keystrokes, but this is my first time with chiclet style keys, so maybe I need to adjust my typing style. I like the full 10-key pad and the backlight on the keyboard. Pleased with battery life so far. Screen is very nice with no glare, which is a pleasant change from my last laptop that had a glossy screen. Doesn't heat up even while playing demanding games.

$REVIEW.: If you do a fair amount of research on this little Netbook, you'll notice a lot of trash talk about the 1.6GHz Via processor not being up to the task, especially when used with the also trash talked Vista Business OS.After receiving my little HP 2133, 1.6GHz, 2MB Ram, & Vista, I can say that most of that bad press is from snotty people who want to nit pic everything to death. This "Open Box" Netbook works great (for a mini). Granted I spent several hours optimizing it (web sites like hp2133guide dot com help a lot), but for the large majority of us out here, the 1.6GHz Mini-Note with Vista (and with a few tweaks) runs fast enough.It does run hot on the bottom, but I don't sit with it on my lap very much. I haven't found anything it won't do (yet). It talks nicely to my Linksys wireless G home network, and thanks to the under appreciated Express Card slot (which was a "must have" for me), I can even connect to the internet anywhere (Verizon KPC680 Express Card) - No "hot spot" needed. Email, YouTube, music, word processing, & it even runs Quake3 pretty good (just testing it). Oh, and the 6 cell battery pack lasted 5 hours before I gave up waiting for it to die. I got mine 100 bucks cheaper at Tiger Direct dot com (open box). Nothing missing & works fine.I drop a star because it does run quite hot on the bottom, and I had to do a fair amount of optimizing of the Vista OS before I was satisfied with the performance. Turning off a handful of Vista's features, and tweaking some settings, really help to turn this Netbook into a nice usable tool. Four stars.

$review_text.: This is a great glare shield and only degrades the picture a very small amount (compared to some other products I've used). The distortion is really just a slight &#34;dim&#34; look to the picture. This is very much offset by being able to actually see what's on your screen in glare-causing situations.Application is easy enough... but also VERY easy to screw up. My first 2 attempts lead to small particles being trapped under the film and ultimately throwing those sheets away. Thankfully they give you 3. The final attempt I peeled the backing only as it came in contact with the screen with only ~1/2&#34; exposed at a time, which worked well. They recommend doing this in a bathroom with hot water running so the steam pulls particles out of the air; I'll definitely try this next time.Overall I'm very happy with the product and the price.

$review_text.: First off, I was one of the very first to jump in and order this case for my Macbook Retina that I got in August.  The case took a while too finally ship but I must say that the customer service was great during that time despite what some other reviewers may have cited.  When I finally got my case it was a gorgeous red shipped in a FedEx box.  The case was easy to install...actually, compared to other cases I've had on my other Mac Laptops...the locking mechanism makes it easy to slip the case on and off.  The fit is tight and snug and the case protects the corner well by some extra millimiters of plastic around the sides and corners.  I did have one issue with my case in which the area below the apple logo near the hinge was slightly scratched from shipping -- I spoke with a wonderful customer service -- rep 1st via email and finally via phone and she offered to easily replace or refund my product for me at my discretion.  I have had this case for over a month and it has picked up a couple dings and scratches but thats better than having that happen to my MacBook but the case still looks great.  I had to take my Mac into the Apple store's genius bar over the weekend and had about 2 Genius bar members come by to touch and check out my case...pretty nice :)  Soo overall, good sturdy build quality, case has locking tabs to enable easy snapping off of the top and bottom covers, has a lip to make my macbook easier to open -- and finally, it just looks really cool -- I've had many steers and people simply coming by to touch and give a simple nod of fashion approval.  No fears sliding it in and out of my Timbuk2 Messenger bag as I commute on my motorcycle to work and where ever else life takes me.

$review_text.: This little speaker unit packs a punch. I am not a techie (sp?), but from the reviews I read before purchasing it, the small size limits the bass so if that is important to you, it is good to know. The sound can fill a very large room. One of the ways I use it is in teaching massage classes. The current class has 14 students in a room roughly 40' x 60', and on low to middle range volume it can fill the whole room even when lots of people are talking.It is a great speaker, no complaints, it is very simple and easy to use.My only complaint/word of caution is in regards to Amazon. This product was listed as a supersaver, free shipping available. so I just "assumed" that that was automatic and the checkout process gave me the option to do a quick check out, since I was done shopping I tried that and it irreversibly charged me for shipping. So don't make the same mistake I did with Amazon. That was really lame.

The LCD screen MUST be spotless before application or the purpose of the screen protector is partially defeated
I used a high grade microfiber cloth of my own to insure all smears, streaks, spots, dust and lint were removed from my screen
It is probably next to impossible to apply the screen protector without amassing a number of air bubbles
I spent well over an hour or two with the squeegee card that resembles an ATM card to remove most of the air bubbles, particularly the bigger ones
I eventually gave up when I reduced the number of remaining air bubbles to about 6 relatively small ones

Air bubbles inside the screen protector look like water spots but are hardly visible when the screen is lit up
Over the course of a few days, I noticed much to my surprise, the residual air bubbles dissolved and disappeared and the screen protector has totally adhered to the LCD screen with no air bubbles or flaws

The key is patience and plenty of time to do the job of application correctly and effectively


The reward is a screen protector that protects your LCD screen, reduces eye strain, reduces UV radiation, and enhances contrast and colors
I am highly pleased with the results

But great results come at the price of alot of patience, labor intensive activity, reading the instructions carefully, squeezing out all the air bubbles and thoroughly cleansing the screen beforehand of any smears, dust and lint particles, stains and the like
I am rating this item 4 stars simply because the microfiber cloth they furnished did not effectively wipe my screen clean prior to application and the process tends to be both extremely time consuming and labor intensive with squeezing any air bubbles away with the squeegee
The work environment MUST be clean and dust free

No exceptions
This product is manufactured in Japan and appears to be high quality material maybe similar to InvisibleShield.

$REVIEW.: I've only had this lens for a few days and I will say it has impressed me. It does have drawbacks, needs lots of light and is somewhat heavy. I would not like to carry all day,but for my need it isn't a problem.I have a couple of photos on display taken the first day I purchased the lens . It was a very overcast day and I think they turned out reasonable for the weather. My test at home when the sun popped out were outstanding. As for the push and pull adjustment I see no problem with it.I think with a little more experience it will be a very good purchase for my budget. I know there are higher quality lens but price becomes an issue,when you are a amature hobbiest like I am.I would recommend for any one who likes to take wildlife photos. The 5 star rating is for the money and quality it is a very good lens!
$SUMMARY.: Very good in bright light!

$review_text.: I really like this sound bar and the quality of the sound for the price


 However, it has proven difficult to get to work with my Logitech Harmony Remote because of the way it automatically selects inputs sequentially rather than going right to the one you want.

$review_text.: The fourthApple iPod shuffle 2 GB Blue (4th Generation) NEWEST MODELgeneration shuffle is a great improvement over the second generation which I loved in terms of the addition of voice-over, fast forward, etc, but why couldn't Apple have retained the same size as the 2nd generation?  The 4th generation's size makes it inconvenient to attach the clip without interrupting the music selection.  The only way to overcome this decided disadvantage is to clip the shuffle on before turning it on. However, I still am happy I bought it.Now that I've tried the Apple iPod shuffle 2 GB Blue (4th Generation)for a month, I'd like to amend my previous review by saying that this version of the shuffle is truly a remarkable engineering achievement.  Even though it's capacity is only 2 GB, it's sufficient for hours of enjoyment and has great features e.g., long battery life, voice-over information about amount of battery left and title of songs being played and the artist.  What more can one ask for for a reasonable pice of less than 50 bucks?  I had previously commented about its too small size, but I now find this not to be the disadvantage noted.

$REVIEW.: Great notebook, with solid feel and decent performance. I increased the RAM to 16GB and installed a Corsair SSD. It is blazingly fast! I also like the fingerprint reader. The only thing I don't like is the button to open the CD/DVD drive. It requires a very hard press to make the disk drawer open.
$Helpful?.: [4, 4] $SUMMARY.: Solid, Stable and Reliable

$review_text.: Figuring that Norton could remove it's 60-Day Trial version from my new PC, I went directly to install from the CD.  Norton tried to uninstall the prior version, and clasped my PC in a deadly embrace.I had to restart the PC 24 times before I finally gave up as Norton was (continually) "removing a former Norton product".  I give up hard, and learn slow, apparently.  The process was unstoppable.I had to E-mail a request for help, and within 14 hours I got a response that was: no help.  The Tech did not read the question nor understand the problem.  My second E-mail to them got a much more helpful response, except it suffered the same problem.  He didn't read/understand the problem either, because he gave an unworkable solution.  The Recovery Tool I had already tried  will not work on the 2009 version of the product.By shutting down the PC for several hours (while waiting for the 2nd Norton response) I decided to see if I could solve the problem.  Fortunately the PC had become unfrozen, and I was able to delete the (remnants?) of the trial version.  Then the Retry to install was easy and immediately successful.Lesson learned?  Believe them when they say to remove ALL prior Anti-Virus products (including their own).  Use the Control Panel to remove it/them.The product itself looks OK, at first look, and I hope it  turns out to be worth the $ & Install hassle.  One thing:  it seems to me to be a strange (Symantec) "License" that lets you one (1) User have this on 3 of your PCs.  How tight-fisted/short-sighted is that?I will update this later if (as expected) I have some good things to say -- and/or not.

$REVIEW.: I just got this case in the other day and it's great! I take my Audio-Technica ATH-M50 headphones to and from work on almost a daily basis and I wanted a nice case to transport them in that was not only sturdy, but also big enough to where I didn't have to constantly fold my headphones up. This fits my needs perfectly! My ATH-M50 headphones fit in this case as if it were made for them. There is also plenty of room for my small portable amp. Also the inside has a nice soft cloth interior which feels very high quality.PROS:-Strong and sturdy, you won't have to worry about your headphones getting crushed-Protects well-Big enough to where you don't have to fold your headphones up-Has enough extra room to hold small portable amps-Fits Audio-Technica ATH-M50 perfectly-Great priceCONS:-None!
$SUMMARY.: Awesome Case! Fits Audio-Technica ATH-M50 Perfectly!

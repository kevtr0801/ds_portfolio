$REVIEW.: I bought these for my father, who is getting hard of hearing, so that he wouldn't have to turn the TV up when the whole family is watching.  They have worked great!!  The only problem is a repetitive ticking noise that appears sometimes.  We think it might be from a local wireless internet connection, though.

$review_text.: I love the way the colors render on my new MacBook Pro and particularly like the LED backlight but found the glossy screen distracting. I was always adjusting the angle to try and eliminate reflections from light sources as my MBP gets used in all sorts of environments. I read an enthusiastic blog review of the Moshi screen protector on and decided that it might provide a real solution. I'm glad I did.While the price seems steep this isn't just simple piece of plastic but an engineered laminate. It is applied after cleaning the screen with a supplied mono-fiber cloth. Only the edges have the adhesive (easily removable and leaving no residue). The aluminum case actually is slightly raised above the level of the glass screen so getting the screen protector lined up was very simple. Because only the edges have adhesive there are no bubbles to contend with. Unlike other plastic screen covers which may exhibit some rainbow effects when viewed at certain angles (sort of like a diffraction grating) this cover provides no optical changes other than a slight dulling that you would expect with a matt finish. It is an excellent product as far as I'm concerned.

I am using it with a D-Link Dir-655 N router

While there is a slight improvement in signal strength and through put I would not recomend spending this much money on it


I would spend the money on the router and use your existing G adapter


The only thing that may be hurtng the performance is that the computer it is installed in is not that robust.It has a 1.5 Pentium chip and 768 Gb memory using XP SP#3.

$REVIEW.: I had been looking for a way to protect my pen when I take it out and about, since I used to take it out in a little pouch I have which did not offer a lot of protection. I was returning a pen case, which did not fit my pen since it was an Echo and the case was for the Pulse, to Best Buy when I saw this case. Since I prefer the small A5 notebook to the regular sized single or three subject notebooks, this case is perfect for me. A word of warning, this portfolio only fits the smaller notebook and journals, since Livescribe has not made one for the bigger notebooks. Then again, there are already portfolios for regular sized notebooks, so if you truly need one, you can find one.Material: I give this a 5/5. The outside is a sort of faux leather material that has a nice feel to it, it is mostly smooth with a slight texture, and it looks nice. The inside is a sort of smooth, but slightly rough fabric. This fabric gives enough cushion and smoothness for the pen to go in, stay in and get out of the holder without the back of the pen being scratched or damaged in anyway. The portfolio looks and feels nice.Notebook Slot: This gets a 5/5. It is strong enough to hold the notebook in place as you write, but it is easy to slide the cover into and out of the slot. Also, the notebook will not jerk up and down in the slot to any kind of movement, it is stuck in place which is nice because you do not have to worry about it working itself out of the slot.Side Slots: I give this a 2/5. The slots in the front cover of the portfolio are too small to really hold anything that I need. It would have been nice if they were at least big enough to hold one of the flip notepads or if they were big enough to hold pages from the A5 notebooks. You could put the ink refills there but it was so tight I was afraid they might break. So, for me, these slots are useless because they are too small to hold anything I would like it too.Bookmark String: This gets a 5/5. This is a nice feature that I have never seen in a portfolio before. The ability to mark where you are in your notebook without having to flip through a bunch of pages is a good feature. I like it and use it a lot.Elastic Band for the Pen: I give this a 4/5. This does the job of keeping the pen secure to the portfolio. I have not dropped the portfolio yet, but I have walked with it in my hands and the motion of my hand did not cause the pen to move out of the slot. However, the roughness of the band gave me concern when I first saw it and my concern was right on. On the rubber grip, I can see tiny scratches from the band. I would have liked for there to be a smooth cushion to protect the pen from getting scratched. As long as you do not let the band anywhere else but the rubber grip, the rest of the pen will be fine.Elastic Band for the Covers: I give this a 4/5. The band keeps the portfolio closed just fine. There is enough elastic in the band for it to hold the portfolio closed if there was nothing in it or if there was more than just a notebook in it. The only thing I would have liked was either a slightly raised area or a small strip to the side that would give you a better grip to remove the band from around the cover. I have really short finger nails so it is sometimes hard to get a grip on the band, it just more annoying than a defect to me.Cost: This is a 4/5. It could have been cheaper, but the convenience in carrying a notebook around with a safe place to put the pen made it worth the price. It is a nice looking, feeling and well put together portfolio that is worth the price.Protection: I give this a 5/5. The notebook has held up for the last four months I've had it. I've carried it around in my hands and in my backpack, and the portfolio protects the notebook and pen just fine. I have yet to drop it with the pen inside, so I cannot speak to that. If I ever do, I will edit my review to include my opinion of that. But, I think that the pen will be well protected form a fall.Overall, the portfolio is a nice accessory for the pen that will allow you to use one item to transport both the pen and the notebook at the same time. It is a good buy at a slightly expensive price that that reason alone.

$review_text.: I live in an townhome and was trying to get internet access out to my detached garage because the WiFi signal in my living room wouldn't reach.  My plan was to use the powereline adapters to extend my network to the garage, then connect the garage adapter end to an extra WiFi router I had laying around. I honestly had my doubts that it'd work since I doubt the garage and my unit are on the same circuit , but decided to try it anyway. Surprisingly, I was able to get intermittent connection in the garage, but it wasn't consistent enough to be of much use. I then had the idea to put the 2nd powerline adapter unit in my son's 2nd story bedroom which faces the back of our home towards the garage and connect my 2nd router there. I now have good WiFi internet access in my garage.Before connecting the router in the house, I did some internet speed testing between the powerline units and speedtest.net and was able to get ~20 mbps download and 2.5 mbps upload which is what I subscribe to with Time Warner. Out in the garage, which is about 100ft from my place with other units as obstructions in-between, I'm getting 7 down/2 up over WiFi. All this to say that these adapters work as advertised, allowed me to solve my access issues, and they were literally plug and play.

$REVIEW.: I've only recently started getting serious about headphones, beginning with purchasing a pair of V-Moda Crossfade LP shortly before Christmas 2013
Since then, I've also gotten a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50RD, Sennheiser HD598 and these V-Moda Crossfade M-100.I was expecting to feel a bit disappointed when I got these, as they have been hyped up so much that I thought surely there was no way these could sound so good
Obviously, I'm no audiophile (yet?) and there are probably some outstanding headphones out there I have yet to get my hands on, but I do have to declare these the best that I have personally heard, and I really haven't even burned them in yet (if you believe in that stuff..which, I'm not quite sure if I do, come to think of it...)These aren't as bass-heavy as the Crossfade LPs, which are a plus for me, as honestly I was never overly impressed with the Crossfade LPs
But the bass is there, and it's kicking

They've sounded great with every genre I've tried them out on so far
Rap, rock, country, blues, you name it
My Sennheisers (which I really shouldn't compare to the M-100s because open vs


closed back and all) might be better for certain genres, my Audio-Technicas for others, but these headphones are the most versatile of the bunch, if that makes any sense.If you're looking for a true, accurate representation of the music you're looking to, or I guess a flat sounding or flat response headphone, these might not be the ones for you
They're fun, however, and make music a joy to listen to


I usually listen to these on my Macbook Pro through a Fiio E07K USB DAC/amp and they sound great.Oh yeah, I haven't even gotten to the design and accessories yet

They look awesome


I know I'm not the first to think of this, but my first thought when I saw the matte black version was, "if Batman rocked headphones while fighting crime, THESE would be the pair!" My second thought after that was, "why the heck would Batman wear headphones while fighting crime???" But I digress


I love that you can customize the shields as well, and if the ear-pads are on the smallish side for you, you can order the XL pads from their website, although the black ones are currently backordered for forever and a day, seemingly.I haven't had to deal with V-Moda's customer service reps yet but they seem to have a reputation for being on point and truly looking out for their customers

V-Moda's warranty and lifetime Immortal Life program (after warranty expires you can still get 50% off a new pair of headphones if they break) are great.Overall, these are a great pair of headphones

The only real con I can think of is the price, but if people are willing to spend $400 on a pair of inferior Beats, they should be ok with spending $300 for these.

$REVIEW.: Got it at a lower price from a local (bleep) during its specials


Also, D-link is currently having sales on its products at giant retailers like (bleep)

Check out Dlink DI-713P(with a printer port) before you consider this model.I used to have the Netgear RP114 router for a year with the Earthlink DSL service: after putting the Dlink 614+, a Toshiba Satelliet 1805 laptop conncted via a Dlink Airplus DWL-650+ card had faster internet connection than with the Netgear
This relatively new router model is better than the others in its lineup in that it has a 256bit encryption mode and can transmit upto 22Mbps on certain wireless cards(like the DWL-650+): whereas the 614+ has four router ports, the 713P has three router ports and one printer port but has only a 128bit encryption mode and max
transmission of 11Mbps.The looks are nice too: plastic case, but two tone colors with nice design with a large D-Link logo on the top of the box.The range is pretty good: note the router be placed at a appropriate place for better reception (places where there are less electrical interference).Ok, the thing is, it took me four hours to get technical service, all the while agonizing over the router that refused to work on the first installation.It turns out that the manual is poorly written; insufficient information about the encryption mode, which I mistakenly turned it on during the installation procedure, was the problem and took forever to find the right method of hardware rebooting(the manual said it wrongly: how can a machine be rebooted after having its power turned off???) Thankfully, the technician(who must be overworking) helped me out to the end, which was really nice(to see some humanity still being served at the end of the telephone line).A piece of warning: if this is the first time you are using a router, be advised to consult the DSL provider service first
You need to use the PPPoE for Earthlink(and other DSL services alike), and for the person who below says this machine does not work with Earthlink DSL is mistaken
It works fine- too bad that the manual is somewhat obsolete in telling you this


Get a friend who knows something about networking, and buy him a meal after his/her headache-the machine will work in the end.There is no wireless router currently at this price range, so if a price is your priority, check this out


After pain, you certainly gain something in this model.

$REVIEW.: We have been really happy with the iPad Defender from Otterbox.  This thing is tough!  If your goal is protection, this is the best thing going.  It also allows for multiple ways to stand it iPad up for viewing in landscape or portrait orientation.Things a buyer should be aware of:1) It is HEAVY.  I have not weighed it, but I would not be shocked to learn that it doubles the weight of the iPad.  Given the protection provided, this is a concession I am OK making.2) The stand that lies retracted in the screen cover is VERY tight when you first get it.  It takes some use to loosen it up.  Until then, you feel like you may break it trying to raise it.CONS - does not come in lime green for my wife...

I turn on the noise reduction and can hear background hiss. If this is supposed to drown out other low frequency noise I am not sure how? Its more annoying then any background noise around me.

$REVIEW.: For the price this drive is a great deal, storage wise.  It looks nice next to my aluminum iMac.  However, the noise it makes might drive you crazy.  If you have a loud computer that already makes a racket then you won't notice a thing.  My iMac is almost silent.  When in use this external drive clicks away as it seeks.  The fan noise isn't a big deal in fact the fan is unnoticeable compared to the noise that the drive makes.  Like other have said, it does get warm but its a large hard drive and this is common. Unlike some other external drive, this one will never spin down the disk (great for accessibility but may shorten it's overall life).  I would highly recommend this purely for backups where you only connect the drive temporarily. Next time, I will consider spending a few more dollars to get a higher quality and quieter hard drive.UpdateAfter only using this product for a few months, it died.  The cause of death was a slight bump.  After that came the tell tale sound of a scratched drive.

In my last apartment, the landlord had a guy that took care of everything to do with the internet. I got this unit when I bought a house last winter, at Meijer with 15% off it was comparable to Amazon's price now. It is perfect for my husband and I, who each have Dell notebooks. I connected it to the Surfboard modem my cable co. provided, piece of cake. I used the included CD, set up a WPA key and was surfing within about ten minutes. The only time I had a problem is when I upgraded to Dell Support Center 2.0 (I got a "problem applying profile" message), but when I uninstalled Support Center that went away. It has been over a year and no major problems, I would highly recommend this unit for a beginner like myself.

$review_text.: I recently built a computer with a small case, and didn't have a lot clearance for anything larger than the stock CPU fan

 The CPU was getting cool, but the hot air was staying in the case overheating everything else, giving my stability issues


 I just get all hot air out and cold air in fast enough
 I was using a FX-8120 CPU, known to get pretty hot.I put in a Corsair H60, and it solved my problems


 Instead of blowing air over a traditional heat sink, which just spreads out hot air all over the case, you can just blow all the out air out the back or side through a 120mm fan hole

 My case didn't actually have a 120mm space for a fan, so I mounted the radiator outside the case, behind the computer


 All the heat is dumped outside the computer, keeping everything inside cool


 No more temperature issues.I would recommend this to anyone who wants the performance of a high end air cooler, but doesn't want a bunch of noisy hot air blowing around in their computer.Pros:+ All one piece, no handling of the seals or liquid+ Easy mounting onto AMD CPU (uses existing motherboard backplate)+ Quiet+ Can be mounted so hot air is blown directly out the case

( A big plus for cramped cases, like mine)+ Opens up water cooling to those who would have never attempted+ Good build quality, not flimsy at all.Cons:- Does not cool the CPU any colder than a high end air cooler
 This is not a custom high-end water cooling loop in a box

 No overclocking record breaking with this.- Many motherboards depend on the CPU fan blowing air down onto the voltage regulator mosfets

 You may have stability issues unless you mount small heatsinks or a small fan blowing on the mosfets


 ( A general con for water cooling in general


I only list it because this product is marketed towards people trying water cooling for the first time, and would not know this.)- All one piece means mounting can be awkward until either the radiator or the CPU plate is attached somewhere- Hoses are a bit stiff to bend



$SUMMARY.: excellent cooler

$review_text.: What a great device for those of us who want a hands free experience.  My 1st gen iPhone discovered it as soon as I turned on the earpiece...no password required, it just connected.So I called and called people and they all said it sounded great.  I had this in my ear for over 2 hours and it was very comfortable.I also signed up for the free 1 year Vocalyst service.  Overall it's nice, but I don't think I will be paying for a renewal next year.  I've set up contacts, my location, sports etc.  Listening to the text to speech in your ear is OK at first, then it just becomes annoying.  Listening to weather was interesting and when sports headlines are read to you, you laugh at the emphasize or lack there of when listening.  Having my email read to me was fun at first, then not so much as it became tedious.  Basic service is $30 a year and the pro service is $60.  Apparently you can have it sent text messages for you and a few other things on the pro-version.If you are looking for a small, comfortable earpiece, then give this one a try.  I'm not sure all of the extra features really make it that much more worthwhile over a different one through.All in all, set-up on my iPhone couldn't have been easier, I was off and talking right away.

$REVIEW.: Very happy with these.  I bought a new TV and the sound was tinny and hard to hear.  I looked at Logitech 506 forsurround sound, but there was no way to directly plug into my new set's optical output.I really didn't want to buy a separate receiver, and I already had a blueray so I didn'twant to get one of the home theatre combo sets.  Plus if you go that route you end upwith a stack of remote controls and a complicated setup.  I've got kids and wife all usingthis set and they want to be able to just pick up the TV remote and turn it on.So I decided to forego surround sound and go with plain old stereo.  I think it was a good call.I wanted bass and volume and these do a great job, just plug them into the TV headphone jack.  No additionalamplifier is needed and the TV remote controls the volume.  You don't need an additional remote that way.They really have the power to fill the room with sound, and have knobs on one speaker to separately control the bassand adjust the volume, so you can tweak how loud it is with the TV remote control.

$REVIEW.: Didn't buy a more expensive iPod because Apple products don't last and if you have problems with them you have to either drive 200 miles to their store or mail it in and get ripped off for the repair.  The ONLY reason I buy Apple iPods is because it is relatively brainless to download/buy music.  Still my big gripe with Apple  is I can't figure out how to load songs I bought back to my computer so have had to re-buy some songs.  Like the iPod, HATE Apple.  You can buy an Apple product anywhere but try to get service where you bought it, fat chance.

$review_text.: This is evidently Sigma's third release of this lens, and it now includes HSM (HyperSonic Motor) so that it will work on cameras like the Nikon D40, D40x, D60, D3000, and D5000. These cameras have no built-in body autofocus (AF) motor. The AF motor is built into the Sigma lens, instead.The easy way to make sure you are getting the HSM version is to check the sales ad for the filter size.  The older lenses had a 67mm filter, while the new lens has a 72mm filter and lens cap. Looking at the lens, it seems a little shorter in length, yet slightly bigger around compared to the older lenses, due to the larger glass.In shooting with this lens, I find the image quality to be simply superb at f/5.6 and f/8.  At f/8 it is every bit as good as some of my Nikkor prime lenses.  I don't make that statement lightly!  I am a strong user of single focal length prime lenses.  The reason I bought this lens is because I own the Sigma 10-20mm super-wide, and found its image quality to be excellent at f/8, also.  I am a tripod-based landscape shooter, so I am mostly concerned with maximum sharpness, low chromatic aberration, and nice contrast.  The newest Sigma 18-50 f/2.8 EX DC HSM lens delivers on all those fronts. It is a lightweight carry lens for everyday "normal" use.Opening the lens up to f/2.8 lowers sharpness, especially in the extreme corners.  The nice thing, though, is that my Sigma is about as sharp wide-open, as my Nikkor 24-120mm VR lens is at f/5.6.  It is quite usable and impressive at f/2.8 and even has very low vignetting, which is an unexpected bonus. Stopping down to f/4 brings this lens into a high-sharpness range that gets progressively better to about f/11.  After that significant sharpness is lost due to diffraction (light being diverted by the edges of the aperture blades).  At F/22, this lens seems less sharp than when wide-open.  I consider the maximum-quality usability range of this lens to be between f/4 and f/11. The larger and smaller apertures are there when you need them, but with some loss of sharpness.The short focal length range (18 to 50mm) is necessary to keep image quality under strict control.  Most "professional" lenses will not have a large focal length range, since it is very difficult to correct for lens issues over a broad range of lengths in one lens.The Macro feature on this lens is quite usable. I was carrying a 60mm Micro Nikkor in my daily carry bag, but no longer do so.  While not true macro, it is very close, and allows me to get up to within a couple of inches of my subject at 50mm.  Quite impressive!Pros:Light-weight and small sizeSolid EX buildVery high sharpness between f/4 and f/11f/2.8 when you need it!High contrastFast and Quiet AF - HSM StyleMacro that works pretty wellLow priceCons:Short focal length rangeLoss of sharpness in edges at f/2.8Diffraction unsharpness quite noticeable at f/22Mild vignetting (light falloff on edges) wide open.I've been using this lens for several weeks now, and would buy it again!  No lens is perfect, and I don't expect this one to be.  However, it easily meets my needs for a very sharp lens that will replace my use of several prime lenses. It adds little weight to my digital Nikons, so I can take it with me everywhere.  It has become the daily "carry" lens on my Nikon D300.  The images I have created with this lens, so far, have made me very happy.  I enthusiastically recommend it!
$review_summary.: Excellent Image Quality, Low Cost, Great Build!

$REVIEW.: Glory be, I love this thing. It takes great shots. I got it because the Wired reviewer said it takes great low-light shots. It does. It also records in RAW.I discovered that SilkyPix, the RAW editing software that comes with the camera, is a powerful image editor. I can change the perspective, the light temperature, the contrast, the gamma, everything. I ditched my copy of Aftershot Pro for this. I also discovered, by looking at my shots in RAW, that the camera actually does some image bending in-camera as it prepares its jpg's.The camera takes great IA shots -- fully automatic -- but I mainly work in Aperture priority mode. And You can pick your aspect ratio -- 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9. I love fitting my shot to my picture.One thing: do get an &#34;Auto Lens Cap&#34; to go with the camera. After owning it a year I gave up on Panasonic's removable lens cap.I wrote to Panasonic. SilkyPix comes with the CDC-LX7, which also comes with an f 1.4 lens. Boy, am I tempted. So obviously I will get another of this product line.

$review_text.: I wanted to set this up on my desktop for my work laptop which is in a laptop stand connected to external monitor, keyboard & mouse.Unfortunately, the power & usb cables included in the box are ridiculously short


They're just over 3 feet long (about 40 inches)

That's long enough for the USB cable since the hub would sit only a foot or so away from my laptop, but the power socket is about 4 or 5 feet away, so it's not nearly long enough
 Usually, USB & power cables are 5 or 6 feet long, why is this one only about half the length?  It's probably more than long enough if you're at a hotel, but, the power cable isn't practical for the way my desk is set up (your mileage may vary).So, I haven't used it yet


 I'll stick it in my travel bag since I think it will work fine when I'm travelling

 Most hotels these days that have wifi or wired internet access usually have a power socket on the base of the desk or bedside lamp so the short power cable won't be an issue there.I would return it, but I procrastinated & now it's too late.

$REVIEW.: It's a cheap price--and a cheap product.  Feels like if I drop it, it will be ruined.  However, reception is excellent.  Audio is a little tinny, but loud.  You will want the programming software and cable.  Even though it's field programmable, it's not very user friendly.  However, programming is a breeze with the cable and free software.  There are some things that could be improved upon (like faster scanning, continue scanning after transmit), but it's still not a bad unit considering it's a full dual-band radio.  Battery seems to last a long time (several days between charges), but you can't go by the battery meter.  It literally goes from full power to dead in about 30 minutes (not much warning).  The PTT switch is a little sensitive, so you have to be careful about accidental keyups.

$review_text.: These are cheap earbuds designed for those who use their phone both for music & talking. While my phone doesn't include an mp3 player, I've been needing a new headset for my phone, & I don't do blue tooth (Blue tooth reminds me of a sci-fi flick where an alien has attached themselves to someone's brain by extending tentacles through their ears; yes I have an imagination & I grew up on cheesy 50's & 60's sci-fi!) so decided to give these a try.Unfortunately the jack is too large for my phone (someday I'll learn to read!), so I can't comment on the microphone. I SUSPECT the earbud quality is acceptable for a conversation.I did try them with music, as the jack will fit into my pc's cd driveI'm not impressed, though you can't expect much for $19.99. The earbuds were a bit too large for my average sized adult ears,  the cord was too short for a pc about 4 feet away from me,  & the music was quite screechy sounding (though on the + side they were very sensitive, they were quite loud at the cd drive's lowest setting).Caveats to the above: This was designed to be plugged into a phone in someone's pocket. The cord would be long enough for that. This was also made with the expectation of being used with mp3 (& likely low bit rate at that); mp3 sounds so bad anyways that the headphone sound quality isn't as important.I'm probably not the best person to review a $20 product aimed at a teenager, my bad for not reading more thoroughly before selecting it.As I can only review from my personal point of view,  I reluctantly give it 3 stars; I would have gone 2  if that was available.  2 stars for quality, 4 stars for it's intended use (teenagers with a cheap mp3 enabled phone).  Though I'm not sure if Ipods are really that cheap though.......!Edit 12/9/10: I purchased an adapter yesterday so these would fit in my phone. They did not work at all with the adapter.

The wife loves it for is size and how light it is.  The only flaw is the recharge time on the flash, it is kind of annoying as others have stated, but that is the trade off for only having 2 AA batteries.  I've been using with Enigizer 2500 mAh rechargable batteries which allow me to take lots of pictures on a single set of batteries and would highly recommend them.

Personally I prefer made in the good old USA, and two, the magnetic closure makes me a bit squeamish for having a strong magnetic force that close to CPU and other hardware. Tablet consumer reviewers, that I've researched, indicate no ill effects from magnetized cover closures but I'm &#34;old school, hence, my uneasiness. Overall, as long as the cover holds together, the keyboard functions, and the machine shows no ill effects from the magnetism, I will consider it a good product. If it were mine, I'd go deeper into describing it's actual functionality but this has been bought as an untested gift.

$review_text.: I've been without cable for a couple of years now, and was very excited about the possibility of receiving a couple of local channels.  The antenna was easy to connect, and all of the parts appear to be of very high quality.  Unfortunately, I tried several locations around my television room, and was unable to pickup any channels.I emailed customer service, and had a response back in about an hour.  They sent me a report showing that even though stations were well within range, the terrain in my area negatively impacted reception.  They had me try the antenna with no amplifier, still to no avail.  A second email was also answered quickly.Customer service was outstanding, but unfortunately the antenna didn't work for me.
$SUMMARY.: Great service, but didn't work for me

$REVIEW.: These plugs are very well made and I had no problems threading the wire down the center and getting it held in place with the center screw. I guess it all depends on the price you get them at, since there are a few other options sold on the site that come down to a few cents cheaper per pair. That being said, Amazon Basics is a line o products that one can trust to always deliver a decent quality product for a fair price, and these banana plugs it perfectly into that model.

$review_text.: I want to say up front that I really wasn't expecting this to work as nicely as it has turned out to work. I was thinking that it would be a device that does okay at a few things, but ends up feeling pretty limited. In actuality, it's managed to really surprise me with how much of my computing time it has taken over. I've actually been finding myself reaching for it when I'm sitting at my desk with my (much more powerful and running MS Windows 7) desktop.The limitations here are really important to consider. You can not install a whole lot of extra software onto the device (by default, anyway, with some tinkering you could make it behave like a more standard Linux-style device). You're not going to be installing MS Office 2013 on here. Though, if you really wanted, you could use Office 365. (On that note, though, it'd be worth giving Google Docs and other options a chance. For most purposes, like writing school papers and working on resumes, the 'free' options are more than adequate.)What the device can do, is anything that you're currently doing through a Chrome window on a desktop or another laptop. For a lot of people this will mean social networking, video calls, taking online MOOC classes, reading the news, writing on blogs, shopping online, and that kind of thing. For a lot of people, there are enough Internet-based services that this'll probably cover everything you do with a computer regularly.Speed - This thing runs extremely fast. 4GB is a lot of memory on something that isn't doing a whole lot more than running a web browser. The processor keeps up with its needs very well. The Haswell architecture has a really good reputation for power-efficiency, and I haven't really been bothered by battery limitations. A lot of devices start threatening to cut me off entirely at 10% or so of power, to ensure they have enough in reserve to not lose anything in storage. This seems content to run down to 5% or so before it starts to nudge me about a potential problem.Storage - 16gb is pretty small, but you get a decent chunk of Google Drive storage for 2 years (100GB) as part of the deal. You can also easily bolster it with USB thumb drives and SD or MicroSD cards, or even full-sized external hard drives.Doing More - When I have wanted to do things that the Chromebook can't, there's a remote desktop feature in Chrome. I flipped it on and basically used the chromebook as a remote client for my desktop. The desktop did all the work of running the software that the portable device couldn't, and I could see and interact with everything that was happening remotely.Video Out - You can get video to another screen with the HDMI port, but this feature was working strangely. It didn't seem willing to go to 1920x1080 for me, and so the resolution was never quite right. This may have been something to do with the fact that I was hooking it up to a TV rather than a device designed to be a monitor, and I hope it's something they eventually fix in the software so that it works more smoothly.ChomeCast - If you have a Chromecast, you can easily 'cast' your Chrome tabs on the Chomebook to a TV that way. Easier than using the HDMI-out, really. It only shows the tab and not your mouse cursor, which makes it impractical as a way to totally use the device with a TV as the screen. For watching videos or reading a lot of text on web pages, though, it works very nicely.Keyboard/Mouse - The trackpad works fine and includes gestures (for example, 2 fingers on the trackpad dragging downward is scroll down). The keyboard is full-sized and reasonably comfortable. It took a few days to adjust and for my typo-rate to drop, but things are fine now. There is bluetooth support, and you absolutely can hook up an external bluetooth keyboard and mouse (I'm sure this also applies to USB if you wanted). I did it. It worked fine.Internet access - Wireless only, no ethernet port (it's not really big enough to have an ethernet port.). You might be able to do wired internet using a USB adapter, I'm not sure. Keep in mind that having Internet access is pretty important to really using this thing, though. It's designed to be an Internet-heavy device.Value - This is what make's the Chromebooks really shine. It comes with the previously mentioned Google Drive space, and also passes for a plane-based Internet service. If you're someone who uses those things anyway and is paying for them, buying the chromebook pretty much pays for itself and it'd almost be silly not to try one out. (If you don't use those things, obviously it's not such a big deal.) Otherwise, the value you get for the simple hardware that's included is still good.Security - And for a few people I know, this is going to be the main reason I recommend a Chromebook. I think we all probably have one or two people in our lives who really aren't comfortable with computers, don't take naturally to figuring out what's safe to click and what's not, and never install patches. Often, they just use the computer for email, a little social networking, and maybe some browser-based games. These devices do those things well, and their limitations are actually a huge benefit because they auto-patch and they don't let you install the kinds of things that often lead to horrible virus infections. For some people, having one of these will work out far better than having a Windows Desktop with much more powerful hardware, because it does what they need to do and refuses to do the things that might get them in trouble.There's a lot to digest there, but the upshot is that this is a really surprisingly nice device. It has a few issues that I've come across and it's definitely not perfect, but it really does well at the things it was intended to do. On the other hand, it's definitely not for people who need to install Windows software, who don't have an Internet connection, or who have the skill and motivation to maintain tight control over their own computers.

$review_text.: I've been using this switcher for a year now and am still amazed at the performance. It is absolutely invisible as far as video and audio quality are concerned, meaning there is no coloration or degradation. What goes in is exactly what comes out. Switching is silent and immediate. It was simple to add this to my Harmony 550 remote and works flawlessly with it.The only negative aspect I have experienced is that it is a relatively light weight piece. If you have all 3 inputs connected to even semi rigid or heavy cables, it can be a chore to route them all and keep the switch in one place. This is a minor but real quibble. I had help holding it in place while routing wires but if you're on your own, I suppose you could stack a couple books on it while you run your cabling. The box is definitely heavy duty enough for that.Bottom line, this is the best bang for the buck component switcher available.You can spend more on a component switch. But I promise you if you do, you're just throwing away your money.

$review_text.: This folio does the job it was bought to do


 It is thin and lightweight, yet it gives some feeling of comfort that my $500 Nexus 32gb won't be destroyed if it falls a couple feet to the carpeted floor.It isn't particularly well made, but what do you expect for $15


And given the relative dearth of Nexus 10 cases right now at any price-point, you get what you can get until what you want it finally on the market.Although the Nexus 10 is probably the most easily handled tablet without a case, given the grippy back panel, it is still nice to have a case with a cover to prevent random accidents from marring the finish

I looked at every single Nexus 10 specific cover, case and pouch I could find and found this to offer the best of everything I was looking for.Easy access to all ports - YesFake leather - yesMagnetized Closure - YesEasy to insert and remove tablet, yet holding securely in place when you want it to - YesMultiple viewing angles - Yes (Two

Well, I've tried TDK Music blank CD's and they don't work in my Philips CD Recorder.  Then I tried Maxell Music blank CD's and some work and some don't.  I finally tried Sony Music CD's and hooray, they work.  If you have a stand alone CD recorder, don't waste your time with TDK and Maxell, only to see some or most don't recognize the OPC code.  Get the Sony Music blank CD's because they work.  They have the OPC code and are recognized without a problem. Thank you Sony!

$review_text.: I travel a LOT, so a good laptop bag is essential. I've been happily using my Belkin laptop bag (which I also reviewed), but decided to give this Case Logic one a try.Here are some features about this bag that I loved:- I have a 15 inch laptop and it fits perfectly and is well protected- The eReader or tablet pocket was my absolute FAVORITE. It's lined with this amazingly soft fabric and would fit a Nook, Kindle, iPad or whatever else you use- The security strap is great for strapping the bag to your carry on, chair, or wherever else the bag needs to go- There are just the right number of compartments to allow you to organize your things well, but not lose them altogether (I have that problem with my current bag). The accordion compartment is great for separating various computer components.- This bag fits a LOT. I always wind up stuffing last minute odds and ends in my laptop bag to avoid unzipping the suitcase. The Case Logic bag comfortably carried my laptop, 2 chargers, mouse, eReader, cell phones, book, headphones, lint roller and GPS, with room to spare.My one pet peeve is that this case is made of that scratchy fabric that's very durable and I believe waterproof, but kind of unpleasant to the touch. It also tends to attract a lot of hair and with 3 pets in the house, that'a concern for me. Then again, most people could probably care less about the fabric, so it's really just a minus for me.

$REVIEW.: Overall the remote works well.It is a bit slow to  send commands to your equipment, ie there is a lag. THe result is you may push the button too many times.The buttons are way too small.  I have skinny fingers and I can never find the buttons.  They are laid out in a way to make the remote look cool, but they are not functional.  The egonomics on my Dish DVR remote is much better.Consider getting a different version of the remote that has bigger keys and a better layout.2 year UPDATE: the volume button is failing. the display is failing.  the remote does not sit well in the charging cradle, thus you may not get a charge.  I plan to buy a different (no frills) version of this remote.FINAL REVIEW.  Battery died, buttons failed.  This thing was a $250 p.o.s.  I wish could change the number of stars, but I cant.  it would get a zero

$review_text.: Before I start, let me say I'm pretty much a brand-agnostic shooter.  I've owned multiple Nikon, Canon, Pentax, Olympus, Panasonic, and Sony systems and like them all for their own strengths and weaknesses.  So, I write this review not as a fan-boy of any type, but just a person that loves camera gear :)That said, what is nice about the E-M1?  Surely if you're a prospective buyer, you've read countless reviews and accolades of the camera.  Though I'm not intending to repeat everything on the internet, I will just go over what stands out to me after a day of shooting with the camera (I received from Amazon yesterday).If we could rate half stars, I would rate this camera 4.5 stars.1) The ergonomics - They're pretty darn nice, actually.  The camera has a real grip, unlike a naked EM5.  I stand 6 feet tall with moderately large hands, and my pinky starts to slip off the bottom of the camera (half-on-half-off) but it's still a great feeling - very secure and no sense that I would drop it.  As of yet have not used the camera strap at all, just the bare camera and 20mm/1.7That said, the new grip does &#34;bulk up&#34; the camera slightly, compared to say my former EM5 or the GX1 I also have, but it's still certainly much smaller than my 6D.Control wheels feel very nice indeed, sure clicks.  The mode dial has a lock button that frankly I find nice but unneeded - that mode wheel is VERY firm and basically &#34;protected&#34; by the profile of the camera, and I'd be highly surprise if I ever, every accidentally change a mode -- I leave it unlocked!Buttons - I wish they were a bit clicky-er and less mushy.  They're not nearly as annoying as the EM5 buttons, but they are still a little too mushy for me.  Same with the shutter button - it's almost a hair trigger and very sensitive, but I got used to it pretty rapidly.2) Operation - So far, so good.  Yes, you have to get used to the byzantine Olympus menu system - get ready to study if you've never used Olympus before.  That said, I have pretty much warmed up to the things one can do with the Olympus menu and button customization.The &#34;2x2&#34; operation mode is AWESOME.  I love love love it, and while it takes some practice to get used to (to prevent changing one parameter, when you thought you were on another), overall it's so very useful.  My rear dial is aperture control, my front is EV comp - a flick of the switch on the back with my thumb, and the front becomes ISO, the rear WB (for me) -- just great.I also really love the flash sync speed and 1/8000s shutter - I've already put both to use just playing around and find them very nice.Olympus quirks still exist  - Press screen to get anywhere-AF box and you lose the histogram, etc, meaning you have to revert to normal &#34;joystick&#34; AF selection to get your histogram back.That said, the quirks are easily overtaken by the level of customizability.  I mean, one can save a Myset now and map it to a MODE DIAL setting!  Freaking awesome -- If you're like me and you NEVER use &#34;P&#34; mode, save yourself a Myset and map it there -- beautiful.AF seems fairly snappy, about as snappy as one can get with the 20/1.7 mounted.  My 12-40 arrives in a few days, so hopefully I can do a proper test to include some C-AF with tracking, etc.3) Image quality - So far it's about the same as the EM5.  Don't expect a massive upgrade in image quality.  That said, it's still a very, very capable camera and unless one is doing some extreme shooting, it should be able to handle almost anything the owner could throw at it.  JPEGs out of the camera look good.The EVF is very nice, but I'm not too picky when it comes to EVFs, so as long as I can use it, I'm happy.  I'm just as happy with my VF2 on my GX1 or even my former XE1's VF - again, I'm not too picky!The negatives - There are very few.  I really wish the body had the flash built-in, somehow.  I just hate the incredibly &#34;fiddly&#34; Olympus (included) flash setup because it consists of 4 different pieces one must juggle if you wish to mount the flash.  I would leave the included flash on, but it adds considerably to the top of the body, so typically I just keep it in my pocket, if I bring it at all.Panoramic mode is useless.  I mean, seriously, almost any other modern camera out today will be better if you want a quick pano stitch.Finally, peaking is very substandard.  You're given the choice of two colors to peak with, black and white, and they're typically very hard to see.  Also, peaking is a special &#34;mode&#34; that slows down the EVF frame rate, as if it's processing it like a complex Art filter or something.That said, the negatives are fairly minor for me, and the positives of the camera really outweigh the negatives.
$review_summary.: A very, very capable camera (and system!)

I've built other systems with cases that have USB ports at the very top of the case and I've come to not like that design because your USB cables will get in the way of your CD/DVD drive trays.However, please do yourself a favor and put the included power supply directly into the trash.  It's a really weak, no-name (Thermal Master) supply that does not have enough horsepower for any modern system build.  I learned this the hard way and I really should have known better.  Buy the case if you like the case, not because it's a case that includes a PSU.  Be sure to purchase a high quality supply like a PC Power & Cooling, Corsair, or Antec.  Think about it, a good 500W-600W power supply will cost more than this case does, so you can't expect any kind of quality from the PSU.

$review_text.: I use the EOS 60Da for both terrestrial and astro photography. I find that the camera works great for both purposes. I have not had an issue with the removal if the ir cutoff filter when using for regular photography. When used for astro photography the all in one solution verses a dedicated specialized astro camera with laptop, and cables makes the whole process much easier and more enjoyable..  I ave also used it for astro photography with a cannon zoom lense and that also works great.  I wish the price mark up for the 60Da verses the 60D was not so steep but otherwise I'm completely satisfied.

4 pairs of different size rubber which is nice but it falls off pretty easy IMHO and the ergonomic "butt" is a little too big for my ear.I bought this pair around the same time and they are fine and fit better

$REVIEW.: When I was shopping around for hi-def-capable video cameras, I wanted to avoid the pitfalls that plagued previous video cameras I had purchased.  Ergonomics, picture quality, ease of use, storage and especially weight were all important factors.  I tried several cameras that were hi-def capable that used tapes and hard disks, but found those things to just add weight to the body.  I have weakness in my right wrist that makes holding a 2 pound camera for an hour really painful.  No matter how awesome the camera is, I end up leaving it at home and taking videos on a tiny point-and-shoot digital camera because it's just not worth it unless I lug around a heavy tripod or monopod.  Fortunately, this unit is light and designed perfectly around the average adult-sized hand.  The controls are easy to reach and the touch screen is great.  I put a clear contact protector over mine to ward off fingerprints.  Note that there is no electronic viewfinder on this unit...and when was the last time you used an EVF on a small video camera?  Right.  It saves weight!As for the quality, it looks good on a large hi-def unit, but be aware that the AVCHD codec compresses the video quite a bit.  The 15 MBps setting gives great quality, but I found the 9MBps setting to be a good compromise between space and quality.  The CMOS sensor can include some graininess in the video, but you've got lighter weight when compared to a 3CCD camera.  Of course, the 5.1 sound is great and the camera picks up ambience well.  You have to be aware that, like all of the hi-def cameras, the real problems come during editing because simple video editors can't handle AVCHD video natively (expensive ones can and upgrades can be bought), so you're stuck with the relatively basic manufacturer software.  A hard disk camera would allow for more storage, delaying the inevitable, but investing in the DVD recorder unit that is now available is a good idea.  Also note that decoding and playback of the HD video signal can slow down some computers considerably...fortunately, the video looks awesome when played back through the camera to the TV via an HDMI cable.Battery life on the included battery is not bad.  It will allow for more recording time than the average user will have Memory Stick space.  Long-play batteries are available, but I've found that 4GB of memory stick and the kit battery are fine for most things.  If you have the portable DVD recorder unit, you can offload as you wish to regular DVDs.  You can also insert the stick directly into the PS3 for hi-def playback.  Note that the AVCHD codec is also used for standard definition recording and the highest standard def setting (9M) is the second-highest hi-def setting...so I just leave it in hi-def mode.Hi-def video cameras are becoming more mainstream, but the manufacturers seem to be pushing 2 main formats.  One is the AVCHD hi-compression codec that allows for longer recording at the expense of quality and the other is the HD codec (using MPEG encoding) that allows for great quality but requires bulky media like DV tapes.Sony has a large camera that does HD very well, but it costs three times as much as this unit and has bells and whistles the average user will never even touch.I would say that this camera addresses the large part of the market that wants something light and easy to use with good video quality.  It's not going to win any awards and I'm sure next year's model will be improved on 100000000 points, but for what it is, this camera works well and I've caught some great video on it.I recommend it, but only if you try it first and compare it to others in a brick-and-mortar store, first.

$review_text.: This is a very simple, well designed piece of plastic
The charge is done over 3 little metal contacts on the side of the Nexus so there's no &#34;click&#34; when connecting


You just gently rest the Nexus 7 on the dock and it starts charging
The color matches the Nexus 7's what makes it a nice piece of [electronic] decoration, too.The flipside is the tablet can tumble over easily if tapped on the back, so I recommend placing close to the wall or other things so there's no room for something to touch the tablet on the back.The biggest downside for me is the price

Although I liked it, I think ~20 bucks is quite expensive for what this is


I guess I'm payng a branding premium
If it was a generic one it'd be half of the price...

$review_text.: I bought these headphones for my father's birthday and he loves them! Having listened to them myself I can honestly say that the sound quality is superb compared to other wireless headphones I have tried


Setup is simple and takes less than 2 minutes

Some sites show the range of these headphones as being either 120' or 240' but the actual practicle range in a home is @ 50'
The packaging states a range of 20m or roughly 60'


At around 50' the sound drops out but up until that point there is no noticeable difference in sound quality

For a larger home the RS 170 or RS 180 models may be a better choice but for small homes or an apartment the RS 160's are PERFECT!!!

$REVIEW.: This is one of the best PCs I have ever used

The features make it a great choice for young and old.Yes the tiles can kind of insulates  you from usual windows operations, but the full range of windows applications are really only one or two clicks away.I think this PC would be a great choice for an older or elderly person who wants to stay in contact with the grand-kids or young folks that are running around with smartphones or video chat.This device lets you use all the new features of Windows 8 that is trying to integrate computer, phones, and game consoles - yes Apple has pretty much done all that, except for the game part.You can connect via Ethernet cable or wirelessly using up to n networking, listen to amazing audio, see HD video, easily link Bluetooth devices and upload media via the card reader.You can attach a USB 3.0 drive and quickly back up your files from the terabyte drive


It also has a built-in webcam and microphone so you can use video conferencing applications with ease.With even greater ease you can use the included wireless mouse and keyboard, or there are other USB ports to attach a wired keyboard and mouse.It's also nice-looking


The all-in-one design makes it look like a big tablet on a pedestal - it could be used as stand-alone kiosk for the proper application

The only thing that is not built-in is the power brick.I think this PC really can help to make a multi-device, touch-screen, Windows 8 life a reality!

$REVIEW.: After putting my hands on this sweet peripheral I cannot imagine ever playing another racing game with a boring old controller ever again. It looks and feels as close to the real thing as you can get. Pop in Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, set it on the in-car point of view, and you'll swear your really behind the wheel of a sweet ride racing down the Daytona speedway rushing into first place. The feedback is unbelievable. The wheel will turn if you crash and has the range of a real wheel. The vast array of button choices make playing the game your way easier than ever. Don't want to use the knob to change gears? Their are hidden buttons behind the wheel if you wish to use them. Theirs a PS3 controller built in so you won't have to fumble back and forth between a regular controller and the wheel. Its worth every penny and you'll feel the quality that only Logitech can provide. Racing doesn't get any better than this.The break and gas pedals are sturdy and well made. The grips underneath the break pad are strong so it won't be sliding out from underneath your feet at all. The response is 1 to 1 with the in-game action. Its built to play Gran Turismo perfectly but also works with other racing games as well. The wheel is sturdy and has a great rubbery grip to help keep your hands on the wheel. The built-in rumble will jitter when your on rocks or sand and give you a smooth hum when your on smooth concrete. A crash will give you a good jolt or you'll feel the slight bumb of a nearby car trying to push you out of the way.The wheel also come with a nice grip to attach it firmly to a table. Logitech has outdone themselves in creating the definitive driving wheel for all games on the Playstation 3. Your simply not playing the game right if you aren't using this wheel.

$review_text.: I did not buy this at amazon.  I bought this from the local big Blue brick and motar retailer in my area.  I just wanted put in my two cents.  I have to say this is one of the best things i ever bought.  It is simply amazing.AESTHETICS: I have the black radio which has a nice glossy finish that blends in perfectly with the rest of home entertainment system. The display is bright, even during a sunny day.CONNECTION: I have only used an ethernet connection with the squeezebox.  I run a 100ft cable from my wireless router/switch to my switch connected to my home theather.  I have not tried the onboard wifi.  Wifi is still very important when using the squeezebox though.  A wifi connection allows you to use an ipod or android smartphone to control the squeezebox.CONTROLS:  I have only used the dial on the Squeezebox only to enter my email and password.  After that i have not touched it at all.  If you have an Android phone or iPOD or if you go to Mysqueezebox&lt;DOT>com life is so much easier. For the android and ipod software are exactly the same, but the andriod version you can use the hardware search button to quickly search for whatever you radio station or music you want.  On the ipod version you will always have to go to the squeezebox homescreen to search.You can also control the volume as well! A few things that i noticed that you cannot do with the software, that you will have to do on the pyhsical squeezebox is set the timers and the 6 hardware shortcut buttons (not to be confused with the favorites off the app).Additionally, this works perfect with a logitech Harmony remote.SOUND: I will admit that I have not used the built in speakers.  I use the headphone jack to connect to my home theather system.  The quailty of the sound depends the quailty of the source of the music.  For example listening to music off my computer, the quailty is excellent.  The quailty of online radio stations depends on the source.SEARCHING: using the search function on the android/ipod is amazing.  After you enter your search it allows to select from a catoriges of differnt options. For example i use Rhapasody and online radio apps mostly.  If i search a random word such as "VIBE" it will ask to search from "Online Radio" or "Rhapsody."  Searching Online radio will bring up any Actual radio station or any online radio station.  If i search using "Rhapsody" it bring further sub-search catagroies such as Artists, Albums, Tracks, Composers, or Keywords.Radio stations:  It is amazing.  I can listen to radio stations from Los Angeles, San Fransciso, New York, and Miami.  So far this thing has picked up EVERY radio station that i have searched for including the BBC Radio 1!  Not only that it allows to search for any "online" radio stations as well.Rhapsody:  It works PERFECT with this.  You can even play playlists that you have created on your computer at an earlier time, while your computer is offline :)Overall:  This thing is PERECT.  If you have and android or ipod, save your money and get the Squeezebox Radio rather than the Squeezebox Touch.  Also, keep a look out in the price for this.  I have been looking at getting this for a while here on amazon. I noticed that the price constantly changes from $139-179, sometimes within a matter of hours!

$review_text.: I received the battery, charged it for a while from my laptop via the supplied USB cable, then finished charging it overnight using my AC adapter plug (a plug is not supplied with the unit). I was able to fully recharge my Android phone for more than a week with the Power Pak. I also recharged my IPad once during that week before depleting the charge in the Power Pak. The remaining charge in the Power Pak is displayed by a series of 1, 2, 3 or 4 tiny blue LED lights when you depress the small power button on the side of the unit. (4 lights means it is fully charged)The Power Pak weighs slightly over 11 oz. and also comes with a carabiner on a Velcro strap as well as a tiny compass. Not sure I will ever use the compass, but I attached it to the Power Pak in case I ever get lost! I probably won't use the carabiner either, since I would probably prefer to tuck the Power Pak away into a backpack or briefcase when I travel. The Power Pak is solid as a brick with a hard plastic shell. The connector panel cover snaps snugly into place when closed and even has small rubber pads that fit into the 3 cable ports, effectively sealing them tightly also. It is advertised as water resistant and dustproof and the solid seamless case design validates that claim. It probably wouldn't survive submersion, but I'm not going to test that !The Power Pak provides a viable power source when you're away from wall power and need to recharge. A business traveler could carry it to recharge on a plane or in the airport when you can't find an outlet, or don't want to sit on the floor while waiting for your cell phone to recharge. A hiker could carry it in a backpack. Carrying the Power Pak means never having to worry about running out of juice for your electronic gadgets.My only criticism is that the user manual is rather brief, relying mostly on illustrations. I couldn't figure out initially that you need to press the tiny button on the side of the unit to start the charging cycle. It is not labeled as a power button in the manual, nor do the instructions indicate when you have to press the button.I received the Power Pak from the manufacturer and have tested it for 10 days in order to provide my opinion of the product.

$REVIEW.: Let's start off with the obvious reason I even considered these earphones in the first place - the price was unbelievably low


I have a pair of Klipsch IMAGE S4 In-Ear Enhanced Bass Noise-Isolating Headphones that I purchased on Amazon


My youngest son managed to get hold of them and somehow lost once of the silicone ear tips
The ear tip replacements are $13


These were half that price


So, after reading many reviews extolling the virtues of these buds I decided to give them a try.My impressions: for the money I am really impressed with these
After first trying them out I immediately felt that my Klipsch's were better but my feelings are changing
I have been swapping them back and forth while listening to the same cut of music and feel that the City Lights are louder at the same volume level and offer as much detail in the instruments as the Klipsch model

 The bass response is DEFINITELY better

The &#34;highs&#34; are perhaps a bit more muted than the Klipsch's
For the price I definitely plan on buying another pair (for my son, so that he will keep his hands off of mine and stop losing my ear pieces!)PROS:priceNice color choicesThe bass is better than my Klipsch'sVery good fidelityThree different size ear buds included so that you can customize the fit to your liking.CONS:Not quite as comfortable in-ear as the Klipsch's (but certainly still comfortable
Everyone's ears are different so &#34;fit&#34; and comfort are a subjective thing).If you are in the market for some ear phones, these deserve your attention.

The radio is so so. You shouldn't have any problems with it fitting because it's a short deck thanks to the no cd player. That's worth a bit if you've ever tried to install a deck and it's just a little too long with the harness.I'll end up getting a better (i.e. more money) deck later but I seriously doubt I'll find a better low cost desk as a place holder or backup.

$review_text.: I've owned this model for about a year, since March 2010, and my satisfaction is mixed

 I first used it on a trip to Spain and France in March 2010, and it did OK
 However, routing from Carcassonne to Andorra took us through some very interesting countryside and back roads
 My paper map showed a much more traveled route which should have been recommended.My biggest complaint is that when I fly to a US location and turn on the GPS, it takes about 10 to 15 minutes for it to boot, find satellites, and load maps
 It initially thinks it's still at the last location when it was used
 Don't be in any hurry when you leave an airport, and hope to have navigation capability, or want to go to a particular destination
 You'll need a paper map for the first 15 minutes

 When the GPS "wakes up," the POI function is still loaded with your last location

 If you search for a specific POI, it may take forever to find the POI you're looking for, because it may be looking for a POI hundreds or thousands of miles away back at your last location

 You have to tell the GPS where you are.The traffic function is questionable
 In January 2011 I was driving at 6:00 a.m

on a nearly empty highway that at other times of the day is quite busy

 The GPS kept warning me about "traffic ahead," when the road was empty

 But, I don't think this is a Garmin-specific issue
 It also only knows "traffic ahead," even though the real issue may be snow-covered roads.This GPS continues to be very slow booting at times


 In February 2011 I took a lengthy trip and plugged in numerous specific destinations


 Sometimes it would take many minutes to re-boot following stops for gas and food, if I allowed the GPS to power off
 I guess the solution is to keep it powered on continuously, until the battery dies.

$REVIEW.: Setup of the Harmony One is simple and user-friendly.  The package includes the control unit, a rechargeable battery, charging station, USB cable, and a programming CD.  If you're not familiar with the programming of the remote, you'll wonder why they didn't think of this function sooner.  You synch the remote with a computer that has the catalog information loaded on it and search for your products in the database.  Once you locate your items, the computer programs the remote to operate those devices.  I'm not as tech savvy as your average middle school kid, so it took me almost an hour to program, but I'd guess most people can do it in 30 minutes.Like I said, I am not on the cutting edge of technology; I did not know such an item existed and really don't have any idea what Bluetooth means, but I know there's now one remote on my coffee table, where once  I had six.  Is it worth the price?  I'm not sure, but I think the kind of people who can consider paying two hundred bucks for a remote control probably don't concern themselves with prices.

It streams video and audio just great from the laptop to the tv as intended.We do not leave it permanently attached to the laptop and have not noticed the connection becoming loose or anything or the quality getting worse.Does exactly what we want it to and can't tell the difference from this cord and the expensive one we got before from BestBuy.

$REVIEW.: The other positive reviews you will find here are accurate. This device has plenty of muscle. You're getting a beefy Broadcom BCM4708A0 chip running at 800MHz, 256 Memory and 128 Flash memory, the WIFI chipset is a Broadcom BCM4352 for a/c @ 900 and a Broadcom BCM43217 for b/g/n @ 300 transfer rate.There was a huge issue with 2.4GHz WIFI slowing to a crawl and dropping packets that required you to reboot this router every other day. The latest firmware supposedly resolves this but I still here complaints that it has not resolved for some.At this time I highly recommend the Netgear Smart WiFi Router AC1750 Dual Band Gigabit (R6300v2) instead of this ASUS router.Here are the 3 major problems in my opinion that you should be aware of  -#1 - The latest ASUS routers have troubles with many Android devices and 5GHz WIFI! Google it. You will find this problem is pervasive with the latest AC routers from ASUS. You either cannot get your Android device (Nexus 7 tablet, Kindle, Samsung Galaxy S3/S4, etc.) to work on the 5GHz WIFI frequency or you some have been able to connect with crazy settings and tweaks done at the cost of causing problems for other non-Android devices trying to connect via 5GHz. ASUS has not resolved this problem yet. Don't know if they will either!#2 - At over $120, you might as well spend the extra $30-40 and get the Netgear R6300v2! Because for that extra money you get the following - a Broadcom BCM4708A0 chip @800MHz, 256 memory, 128 flash memory and a WIFI chipset of Broadcom BCM4360 + BCM4331 a/c @1300 and b/g/n @450 respectively. These are the newer chips that are not as buggy and perform better. I have also seen this item on sale on Amazon for around $135! At that price this is a no-brainer folks!#3 - I see a lot of major retailers are suddenly no longer selling this device. That means there is either a version 2 coming that will correct these problems or another product altogether. In other words, 'something isn't right' and you're going to be buying the obsolete, defective past that will probably never get fixed.If you really want top of the line for $200 (or around $170 on sale) the Netgear Nighthawk AC1900 R7000. It gives you a Broadcom BCM4709A0 @1000MHz 256 memory 128 flash memory and a WIFI chipset of Broadcom BCM4360 x2 for a/c @1300 and b/g/n @600.The Asus RT-AC68U (their top of the line flagship router) gives you this Broadcom BCM4708A0@800  256 memory 128 flash memory and WIFI chipsets of Broadcom BCM4360 x 2 for a/c @1300 and b/g/n @600. But the price for that is currently $210 !!!!!!! With Android bugs mentioned above still unresolved! Ridiculous! In ASUS's defense I will say that their router firmware is packed with way more features and options than the Netgear firmware. So if you are in the market for a truly full featured product...the ASUS may still be the way to go. But you would also just be better off getting the Netgear and putting DD-WRT firmware on it and getting tons more features!Let me be clear - I am a huge ASUS products fan. They do good stuff! I love their motherboards and video cards and other products. These routers are also really good! But with the current crop of problems and odd bugs, I would steer clear.

$REVIEW.: I just got this two weeks ago


I've had several Denon receivers, an Onkyo, an a JVC Flagship receiver that was THX certified

This Marantz sounds significantly better than all of them, the best sound I've ever had

The most surprising thing is how CDs sound


I can play them louder because the high end doesn't hurt my ears
SACD's, DVD Audio music discs played through my Oppo 980 sound amazing


Movie sound is also improved, even over the Denon AVR23II I had, and Denon makes a great receiver


As for the picture quality, I would say that it's possible that the upscaling is not as good as the Denon but there isn't a big difference


The picture played through the HDMI is very good

But I have a lot of music and a lot of surround sound audiophile music discs including HD Audio CDs and Gold CDs and they sound amazing through this receiver


I feel like I've gone out and spent thousands on separates.

$REVIEW.: My plan was to buy this, use the receiver, and then have my Logitech 550 learn the mouse commands, since we stream to our TV through the computer (using Win7).  Unfortunately, I couldn't get the Logitech to learn the commands (by using a template or by directly learning each button), but it does a decent job of mimicking a mouse and arrow keys, along with some other specialty keys (such as My Computer, alt-F4, backspace, etc.).  You can also turn on num-lock and type like you would text on an old-school phone, but this is really pretty awkward.  Also, you have to point this unit DIRECTLY at the receiver -- no bouncing the signal off walls, etc.  So, this lets me leave the bluetooth keyboard on the computer with relative ease, pointing my way through media center, Hulu, or internet explorer bookmarks, or play iTunes, but that's really about it.
$SUMMARY.: Works GREAT as a mouse & limited keyboard substitute, but not universal

It's been working fine without any problems.Yes, it is made of plastic and feels a little cheap

I bought this because it was the cheapest USB hub on Amazon, so I can't really complain
I use it everyday and it hasn't broken
The transfer rates are fine for my needs, even when transferring large photo files from my dSLR.I find the ports to be a little snug, but not tight like some reviewers state

$REVIEW.: I saw the 4K+ very positive reviews for this seller, and decided to give them a shot. When I received this mother board, I noticed upon inspection that it was missing three buttons (-1 star), but decided to try it out anyway. Well, the motherboard wouldn't post upon starting up my computer (-1 star) so I sent an e-mail to the seller regarding the missing buttons, and the posting issue I experienced. They were surprised that I was experiencing issues since they test the devices before they are shipped out, but authorized a refund and apologized for the negative experience.( I ended up going to my local Fry's Electronics store, and bought one new for the same price.)

I was worried about being able to adapt to using a covered keyboard and if it would hinder me, but it doesn't effect my typing at all

I would have given the product a 5, if it would have been design not to interfere with the volume buttons. I quickly over looked that however, because the concept is design to get an extra USB port. I was able to read and write to a external hard drive and SD card at the the same time. The adapter had the power to do so. It is nice and small and fits in many of the cases that I have used with my device.

$REVIEW.: I used to really be into car stereos when I was younger
 I hate having a deck because mine always used to get stolen
 I was running a small system with a 4x35 watt amp and upgraded speakers with a line converter to turn the high level output of the factory unit to low level input for my amp
 The sound was pretty good, but the factory radio had a terrible volume control
 It would go from quiet to loud in just a couple clicks
 This deck solved the problem


 I have a nice smooth volume control


 Gradually gets louder as opposed to going from dead quiet to super loud in half a turn of the knob.This deck has a bunch of options I will not use like the lights that change color and such


 It was nice that I could choose a color

 There are tons of colors

 I chose one that matches the rest of my factory lights in the surrounding controls
 The USB interface works a lot faster than I expected
 Pretty cool that I can put hours and hours of music on a flash drive


 Nice clean sound


 For the price 90% of people couldn't here the difference if they spent $400 on a deck

 The price is to the point where it is not a huge loss if it gets stolen


 Keeping my fingers crossed mine will be safe for a long time.

The WD media player works great and was relatively easy to set up and easily recognized my wireless network, indexed the contents of the external drive and provides wireless connectivity between the drive and my PC.  The device has been able to play any file I threw at it with the exception of the iTunes stuff, so I am very happy with the WD media player.

$REVIEW.: I'll keep it short
I've owned this thing for about 1.5 years now and it's simply the best thing I've spent money on in that time.Coming from a traditional netbook with an Intel Atom processor, I thought the SU7300 Intel processor would be a bottleneck

It's not a problem AT ALL
For most tasks, this laptop is faster than my desktop running a AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core 5200


The only thing my desktop beats it in is doing large video transcoding

Fortunately I don't do that often.Linux support:I'm an Ubuntu user, and at first Linux support seemed problematic, but after making a few minor adjustments to the config files I have everything working perfectly except for the NVidia 210 card


This has not been a problem for me since I'm not a gamer
The Intel video card is stunning


It's snappy 2d and 3d performance with full desktop effects in Ubuntu surprised me
I kinda wish I would have bought the version of this without the NVidia card since I never use it.Battery Life:The #1 best thing about this laptop is that I regularly take this thing to work and never have to worry about bringing the power adapter! I literally can use this thing for web-browsing and writing software all day and leave work with thirty-minutes or an hour of battery left (assuming I put it to sleep while I'm at lunch)
I will never buy another laptop that can't do 9+ hours like this can.Keyboard:I've gotta give props to the guys who designed this
The arrow keys are in just the right spot, the home/end/pgup/pgdn buttons are in the right spot, and the size and spacing of the keys makes this thing a pleasure to type on
The only minor issue I have is that I wish it had a backlight for low-light conditions.Summary:It's a bit pricey, but I have absolutely no regrets


I'd consider this the best laptop I've ever seen.

Of course it won't support sli or crossfire but it gets the job done! The fan is quiet. All the cables were long enough to reach all of my components in a mid tower case (HAF 912). Honestly, it was a very cheap psu solution as after rebate, it was less than 20 dollars. Where can you find a price like that anywhere these days.

$review_text.: I'm new to photography. I became disabled due to a spinal tumor, and lost some dexterity and physical strength in the last few years as a result. Photography is a new hobby for me. I wanted something that would protect my investment in the camera while also making it easier for me to use. This skin works really, really well for both purposes. Fits the camera like a glove, with the exception of the &#34;hot shoe&#34; where a rubber flap fits in, but sometimes slides out. I have two dogs, and thus lots of dog hair around and this keeps the camera from collecting dog hair, too! The skin has a nice rubbery feel, not to sticky but not too squishy either. I took away one star because the buttons are a little hard to press and to see what they are if you're not already super familiar with them. Otherwise, it's great. I'm sure in time I'll be used to it and will raise my review to five stars! I use it with a wrist grip attached to the camera and can let it dangle from my arm without worry when not taking a photo.

$review_text.: This clock is not for everyone


 And it does have the presence, as another viewer wrote, of being in a train station


 So, who cares?  The smaller 12" size fits my rooms just fine


 Red is in my computer room and blue is in my kitchen and living room
 The blue lights up a room a lot more than the red


 I like it for the "night light" look when I get up to go to the kitchen for water, etc


 The light has saved me from getting killed by tripping over stuff that I wouldn't have seen before
 FYI:  the holes for mounting are a joke
 Unless you use a screw with 1/8" head


 I tried mounting one with double stick Velcro over a door frame in the kitchen


 Seemed to work fine
 Until next morning


 The light was laying on the floor face down, still working, and no broken plastic face


 Amazing!  But inside, there are four plastic posts that hold the circuit board and time modules in place


 3 were broken off
 They were easy to re-glue and now it works fine

 The Velcro stayed stuck to the wall but came off the plastic back of the clock
 I wound up making a flexible "clamp" style holder that attaches to the wall with expansion grippers

 So if you are planning to use the hook & loop type fastener, be advised that the double stick doesn't seem to be compatible with the plastic on the back


 Fortunately, the frame is metal

 I am also pleased that you don't have to use batteries to maintain the time in case of a blackout

 I like it.

$review_text.: so far i've had this SSD drive installed on my living room HTPC for about a week now. the transfer kit worked without a hitch.i did not purchase this drive for the land speed record, but rather it's "supposedly" one of the more reliable drives out there right after Intel 520. and since this drive will be a practical use in a practical home theater PC, land speed record isn't what i am looking for. i just need decent SSD speed with most reliability.my synthetic bench show reasonable 260/250MB/s for sequential read/write, and 21/60MB/s for random 4K, which is on par for SATA II bus speed.THERE ARE a few things you need to prep before migrating.1. if you're doing a fresh install, then no worries. but if you're migrating from an mechanical drive, you need to enable AHCI driver in windows registry prior to changing the BIOS I/O from IDE to AHCI. failure of doing so will result in blue screen upon reboot. there're instructions on how to do so online. there're also drivers that'll do this for you in the registry as well.2. you need to consolidate your partitions on the drive you want to migrate from. the transfer software will migrate everything that's on the physical drive onto the SSD, so if you have multiple partitions including the boot partition, you need to backup all the secondary partition data, and erase all secondary partitions, and use Win7's "extend partition" feature to extend the primary boot partition to utilize the rest of the free space, that way you have a complete single partition ready for migration.3. once everything is migrated, and booted up into windows, you need to run Windows Experience assessment. doing so will ensure the proper detection of SSD and windows will then enable TRIM and disable Fragmentation. For me windows properly enabled TRIM, but didn't disable fragmentation. i had to manually disable it.4. this last step is not required but none the less a good last step for insurance. make sure TRIM is running properly by going into CMD and type "fsutil behavior query DisableDeleteNotify" if the result shows "0", then TRIM is properly enabled. if it shows "1" then it's not. YOU NEED TRIM for all SSD to keep the performance running at prime and keep up its life.i will do a long term update if i notice anything new down the road. but this drive is finally now at a reasonable price range for a reasonable person.

$review_text.: How many times have you read the suggestion to always have a 2nd or backup battery for your camera?  Hundreds!  At least for me.  So I've had an Olympus SLR for quite a few years and I've managed to always have a charged battery.  (I'm a bit obsessive about batteries being charged.)So in theory, I should never have need for a second battery.  And in my case, if the battery did croak, I have two other kinds of cameras hanging off my shoulder.But as luck would have it, (and the fates laughing at me), I was at an assigned photo journalist shoot at a NASCAR event and I had burned so many pics off and was there for so long, that I actually did burn through the battery.  (did a lot of standing around and test focusing for upcoming shots at different corners.)So!  The tale goes as this... I will never have a dead battery on my person again.  And this battery works as promised, is in great shape, seems to give me pretty much on par with the original and I could not go wrong with it.  Hoo ya!!!-Bruce aka, brusimm

$REVIEW.: Edit to add-Harmony Tech Support is wonderful! I've had an issue with the charger for a while and finally got around to calling. To make a long story short-yes there is an issue with the charger(it has been fixed for remotes produced after I purchased mine)and we'll be sending you a replacement-FREE. I was nearly a year out of warranty! I'm very impressed.I will start with the only bad I've found-it's a pain to program the av receiver and the remote each time you want to update. It's not hard but a laptop comes in handy. The good-where do I start? Push one button for almost anything, it could not be easier. I've waited a few months to post this review so I could say with certainty my opinion. If you have visitors, make sure they understand they only have to push one button (example-"watch tv") and the remote turns on all the components. Once you understand what the remote can do it is phenomenal!

$REVIEW.: For the price of the T1i, you are getting a 7D with lower frame rate bursts and less autofocus points. This really upstages the 50d, d5000, d90 and to some extent the 7d. This is my first DSLR and I'm glad I picked this one.  It's awesome.  Excellent quality and it's great for amateurs like myself.  I love it!Pros: Excellent video at 1080p 30, 25 or 720p 60Excellant image quality with 18mpBest in class LCD screen (high resolution & accurate colors)Mic input.Cons: Kit lens is not the greatest but it get's you started.

$review_text.: Pros:-This is indeed a very slim drive; noticeably more slim than other drives of comparable GB size that I own.-Plug and play on a Mac.-Can be used between both Mac and Windows machines without reformatting.  However, see cons below regarding not being instantly plug and play for Windows.-The 3.0 USB data transfer speeds are indeed faster than 2.0.  (Your mileage may vary due to a multitude of factors too lengthy to list here).-Very quiet drive.  No noticeable drive noise while working.Cons:-NOT instantly plug and play for Windows 7 or XP.  You CAN use it on Windows by downloading and installing Windows hardware drivers to read straight from the drive's factory HFS+ format.  HFS+ is the format used by Mac (Apple).  You can get the Windows driver from Seagate's website.  Getting and installing the driver is not difficult, but a tech beginner might find it easier said than done.Not really pro or con, just info:This drive comes with a cable that has USB 3.0 to Micro-B USB 3.0 connectors.  This is for connecting to any PC with a "normal" USB connector.  The "Micro-B USB 3.0" end is a bit odd-looking compared to older drive connectors and seems to be becoming a new standard among external drive makers.  I have two drives now that have this new connector type.  One is a Western Digital drive and the other is this Seagate Slim drive.  Not a big deal if you don't lose the cable that came with this drive, but just so you know, your "old" drive cables won't work on this drive.  This new 3.0 connector is to help in higher data transfer speeds.
$review_summary.: Excellent Drive, but NOT instant plug/play for Windows.

While sometimes I question the (un-necessary) software overdo, the product, until recently, has never failed me.During one of the many power failures (we all have to endure...WHY???)  a 12 year old UPS back-up failed.After contacting APC's technical support, and a very short process of push the button, listen to the prompt sequence, I was connected with a rep that totally satisfied my inquiry.

$REVIEW.: I'm always tempted to get the more expensive product. After all, capitalism works--and better stuff usually costs more. It has served me well over the years.However, with accessory cables, that's not always the case. It most certainly paid off to spend more on analog cable, with all the potential issues (electromagnetic interference, radio frequency interference, impedance mismatches, connector integrity, etc.).However, with digital cable, you most often either get a great signal or no signal. The interference issues remain, but not nearly to the degree they do with analog cable. The BlueRigger cable is built to mitigate signal issues. Copper wire? Check. Noise shielding? Check. Strain relief? Check. Gold-plated connectors? Check. Rugged jacket? Check.The BlueRigger works as advertised, providing a perfect image when used with my Dell convertible laptop/tablet. It also makes a great monitor cable for my Mac Mini, delivering the maximum resolution to a Dell wide-gamut 2560 x 1440 monitor. As a bonus, it even appears to be extremely well-made. And for a killer price.

$REVIEW.: I've liked Belkin's line of cables and connectors and have found them reliable and as described for other purchases and uses. This one is no exception, and it will stream content from a PC with HDMI output to a TV should you need such a link. I'm actually not sure how useful it may be and hope it does not end up stashed in the "someday" closet. My main qualm, though, is the price. If I were buying this cable, and I did get a reviewer's cable, I would look for a less-expensive option. I may not buy the cheapest but I would consider a more budget friendly cable for this purpose.Drop the price, and my rating could improve but I cannot honestly suggest that anyone spend this much money on a digital connector.

$REVIEW.: If you want an affordable set of IEMs or earbuds, Delta has got clarity of sound across the board. Perfect for talk radio and pop, but you might find them a bit lacking if you want that thumping bass. A tad light there. Electro and house are particularly impressive and I can easily pick out the background instrumentation as it moves from one ear to the other. They are ear-popping loud when you ask for it.The Brainwavz Delta really goes all out with the comfort factor and include four sets of ear bud tips. Three are silicone and one foam. I definitely appreciate the extra effort Brainwvz made here because I&#8217;ve had some really pricey earphones that had an awesome soundstage, but were barely wearable they were so uncomfortable. There&#8217;s a slider in the Y-cable if you want to secure them under your chin.The &#8220;look&#8221; is sharp. Unlike the standard black I saw often see, the Brainwavz Delta IEMs make a statement. The housing is a flashy metallic with a splash of red with the big E in the center. The rust-colored Y and slider is a popular color that many twentysomethings go for. The cord is a very generous 4.26 feet, perfect if you&#8217;re trying to listen at your desk and that tower is way under there. The look, the performance, and affordability factor are all in place with the Brainwavz Delta IEMs.SPECS:&#9835; Drivers: Dynamic, 8mm&#9835; Rated Impedance: 16 &#937;&#9835; Frequency Range: 20Hz ~ 20 kHz&#9835; Sensitivity: 100 dB at 1 mW&#9835; Rated Input Power: 2mW&#9835; Cable: 4.26 feet (3 m) Y-cord.

$REVIEW.: What a joy. A tiny Bluetooth adapter that works with Windows XP right out of the box. (Vista seems to require a special driver.)There's really not a lot that can be said about a product like this.It is exactly what it promises to be, a very small and useful Bluetooth adapter. Plug it into a USB port and it is functional within seconds. I tried it with cell phones, Bluetooth headsets and Bluetooth mice and everything paired within seconds.No drama. No hassles. No frustration.Best of all, perhaps, is that it so small and without any sharp edges, you can leave it plugged into your laptop or netbook without any fear of snagging on your carrying case.Excellent product at a good price.Jerry

$REVIEW.: This is well packaged, high quality, and an perfect replacement (if not better perhaps).I am one of those people who always buys name brand, from the manufacturer. In this case, going with the Canon brand would have cost me around 5x as much. I decided to take the plunge and gamble my $30, and I was extremely satisfied with the result.These batteries last just as long as the stock 5dMKii batteries. They are extremely reasonably priced, and then you get a cleaning kit on top. This is a great deal.To power a $2500 camera body with perhaps a $1500 lens you really should just spend the $30. Extremely good deal.

$review_text.: I was so happy to transfer my MacBookPro from it's current case (a too-big leather briefcase that was intended for other things) that at first it was hard to be objective
It is nylon, not leather, but sturdy, and looks fine (would have preferred a leather strap instead of shiny, though sturdy, black nylon
But, again, a small thing and the strap is comfortable over the shoulder though mostly I just use the handle.) I like all the pockets and the internal organization--even a place for a smartphone

I don't have an iPad, but there are two pockets for tablets on the side and I keep my Nook (and cords) in one and a Kindle Fire in the other


It has plenty of room if you wanted to use one for power cords

There's plenty of space.So, from one side going forward, it has (1) a large pocket that -does- unzip on all three sides fully, (1) a small top-loading pocket for your smartphone (or pocket camera), two side-by-side pockets for ipad-sized things (I have my Kindle and Nook and assorted cords and media there--could also put a point and shoot camera or various accessories)


Then comes the pocket for the (side-loading) Macbook and, finally, a front sleeve for papers, books or whatever


It doesn't "open up" so the storage space isn't on the inside, other than what I've mentioned as pockets.The storage compartment for the notebook is lined with soft material and holds it securely

(I thought I had a 15 inch laptop, but now realize it is a 13"--doesn't matter, as it still fits well and I can add the cord in the extra space if I want to.) Only oddity to me is that it loads from the side and doesn't unzip completely on all three sides (so that it would open and lay flat.) But, ultimately, it's just as convenient to slip it inside from the side so...not a big deal.Anyway, I like it, it's easy to carry and feels secure and the variety of storage spaces make it versatile and useful as a way to protect other things, too.

$review_text.: This camera packs a lot of features for the $1100.00 price tag, but its well worth it.Sony introduces new changes and improvements for the 2013 Handycam line. The Sony HDR-PJ650v has a 20 lumens(360p) built-in projector, which was introduced in the 2012 models and enhanced from the previous 13 lumens projectors. Now via the "Micro HDMI" cable(included) and changed from the previous "Mini HDMI" input. You can now stream content from your tablet or compatible smartphone(like a Samsung Galaxy S or iPhone) through the Projector via a dedicated Projector Input terminal. Now for the first time ever, you can record footage in dual video format(AVCHD Progressive or .MP4 for Web). The .MP4 format supports full 720P HD(30fps) and 20.4MP still images. Both MP4 video and still images can be uploaded through a tablet or smart phone Via the new "Multi-Interface" Wireless Adapter(sold separately), and you can even control camera functions remotely from a tablet or smartphone and preview the footage.I wanted to address the .MP4 format quickly. In case you are wondering why it's only 720P(30fps), it has to do with file size and what most Tablets and Smartphones are capable of handling, be it iOS or Android. Most Tablets and Smartphones typically are only up to 720P and record in 30fps, but .MP4 is the most file-friendly because its a simplified format that all wireless devices run on. And anything in the 1080i/p 60i or 60p range where the frames are doubled and the resolution is higher and needs more compression would be way too large and most devices that are running 1080 resolution are only running at 30fps, and the lines of resolution are not very high for mobile devices to begin with. And since the Wifi feature of the camera is meant to be mobile enabled, 720P is just more realistic and feesible since most people who own an HD Tablet or an HD Smartphone at least have one that supports 720P. Also, the file size is much easier to edit if you plan on editing videos with a Tablet or Smartphone.However, because this is 720P HD with Balanced Optical Steady Shot, it makes the footage much more stable than any Tablet or Smartphone, and current Smartphone cameras and Tablet cameras can't even begin to compete with this kind of image stabilization. Also, this is true HD resolution with 6 iris blades backing it up, so the images you upload are going to be way sharper in detail and higher in resolution and more focally balanced as opposed to a camera phone where there's no optical stabilization and weak lines of resolution, and a lack of true to life colors and saturation. So if you plan on uploading footage for mobile purposes, this is a much better and grown up option than relying on your camera phone which is limited as a competent camera for recording those details you can only get from a full camera, and will certainly look more impressive and give camera phones a run for their money, and certainly a feature worth showing off to friends just to compare quality.The 5.1 channel microphone has also been greatly enhanced and streamlined to reduce background noise and improved richness in sound quality for crystal clear audio as well as a reduction in motor noises by the camera, pretty much gone. They have also improved the low-light feature of the new camcorders for improved low-light performance that may have you recording at night more often. This camera features the sublime "Balanced Optical Steady-shot"(introduced in the 2012 models) which keeps the footage steady as a rock while moving or in the car as the entire lens block is litterally floating inside the camera housing reducing camera shake by 13x over the Optical Steadyshot for the best available stable footage without the use of a tripod or stabilizing equipment.The lens is a 26.8mm(35mm equivalent) Sony-G Wide Angle Lens with a 46mm filter diameter. It also comes with a lens hood, a step-down ring to fit 37mm lens accessories, and still features the built-in USB 2.0 cable for transferring files, as well as a headphone jack, microphone jack for external microphone attachments, and now the "Multi-Interface Terminal"(replacing the A/V R from before). This camera also has an extendable electronic viewfinder which is pixel equivalent to the LCD screen(921k), so it's one you can actually use. This model also features a 12x optical zoom, a 20x extended zoom, and a 160x digital zoom. You get much more optical zoom on this model than the PJ790v which costs much more. The only feature lacking on this model is the "Nightshot", if you care about that feature. But there's loads of professional features packed in like zebra, peaking support, golf shot and more.You can also still transfer your recorded footage to an external HDD without a computer. They eliminated the dedicated USB port on the older model camcorders which was replaced by the Projector input and incorporated it into the "Multi Terminal" on the side of the camera instead. So you will need an additional Multi USB adapter cable(sold separately for $19.99) to use with your external HDD. So for those fearing that feature was gone, it isn't. Much of the older and familiar camcorder functions have been reassigned to the Multi Terminal in order to streamline the camera.The good news with the new "Multi-Interface"' shoe and "Multi-Interface Terminal" port, you can still use "A/V R" and "Active Shoe Interface" accessories, but you will need to get a "Multi-Interface A/V" adapter cable(sold seperately) and a "Multi-Interface-to-Active Shoe" adapter. They cost around $20-$25 each, but if you already own "Active Shoe" accessories and "A/V R" accessories, you will require these for your "Multi-Interface" enabled camcorder since all the 2013 models feature these. So at least they are affordable.I do have some minor complaints on the PJ650v. The internal storage 32GB flash might be fine for recording in the .MP4 format if you plan on uploading web videos to Facebook or YouTube since its only 720P, but in the AVCHD Progressive format in 1080i/p is only 2-3 hours of recording time. So you will need an SDHC, SDXC(up to 64GB Class 4 or higher)memory card with a larger memory capacity, or have an external HDD for storage if you plan on recording in the higher formats. But overall it's fine on the lower formats, about 7-11 hours of recording time.My only other complaint is the stock battery Sony included. The package is solid, maybe Sonys best camcorder value. It includes the HDR-PJ650v, a lens hood, remote commander, step down ring, USB transfer cable, micro HDMI cable, AC adapter, and power plug. But If they are going to market high-end consumer camcorders, they really need at least the NP-FV70 battery included, the stock FV50 is almost worthless. Keep it as a back up, but you can buy 3rd party batteries at a fraction of the cost of Sonys overpriced batteries that are much better.Overall, for the money and the streamlined enhancements made to this years 2013 camcorder models over the 2012 models, I have to highly suggest this camcorder, maybe over the PJ790v in terms of price and features. You're pretty much getting all the new features, and its the best model to get over the lower end models of the 2013 line. The only major difference with the PJ790 and the PJ650 is a Carl Zeiss lens, nightshot, a slightly larger MP still image(24.1 vs 20.4), and a slightly brighter projector(35Lumens vs 20 Lumens), and a slightly larger sensor. It really comes down to whether or not you want to really spend the extra money for a few slight enhancements when the cameras are pretty much identical, and it's a top model camcorder. Overall the 2013 Handycam cameras are perhaps Sonys best yet, and really bridge the gap between consumer and professional. It's easy enough for consumers to use, but also not so simplified that it isnt appropriate for professionals to use as well.

$REVIEW.: I bought this for my Eclipse Spyder

I can't see a whole around me when I have the top up which was the reason for this purchase


The camera has a great picture on it, day or night

Everything is nice and clear and the colors are fine

There's also a guide that it has to help when you're backing up


The bracket that you use to mount it can be moved from the bottom to either the top or behind depending on where you need to mount it
Hook up the power feed to your backup light to power it

Then run the video cable to inside the car...that will be the biggest issue
That took me about an hour to do
The only downside I would mention would be the instructions or the lack of clear instructions in English

But it's pretty obvious as the how it needs to be hooked up.

It's not OK to fly blindly with these and hope your data is doing alright.Anyway, I sent it back and Amazon.com sent me another before I had a chance to tell them I wanted to try a different brand.Guess what... same thing.. "MASS STORAGE". I tested my WD drive with a friend's enclosure and it came up exactly as it should, showing the model # and all information propagated through HD Sentinel as it should.This one is going in the garbage and I'm going to spend a bit more for a different brand.Bottom line: Not worth your time and certainly not worth your DATA!

$review_text.: Power IQ works!! This is actually my second unit and it speaks volumes on how good this unit it. I have tried Bolse 4 port USB charger which at first I thought was neat. I also have the first generation Anker USB charger (not power IQ) that seems to be a hit and miss when I charge my Nokia Lumia 920 with it......I sometimes wake up on the morning with my nokia's battery totally drained  and the phone very hot using the older anker charger. It has not happened with the power IQ and I was so convinced I got a second unit for travel purposes. Using my Bolse travel charger, my iphone 5s touch screen gets so finicky when I am using it while being charged. This does not happen with the anker power IQ....this is to me the best there is. No need to see which port is for android, iOs or ipad.....because the charger will automatically determine the optimal charge for the unit being hooked with it......it is a trully plug and play charger......I love it!

$review_text.: Returned this item because it would not read formatted disks but instead stated that each disk I used needed to be formatted.I did reformat one disk and then that disk could not be read by other computers.These knock offs are, I think, like the original Timex watches; If they work, they work well

 If they don't work, they will be no good for ever

Kind of a hit and miss chance that any of these work properly.If you have the time to continue to exchange these things, you will probably eventually get one that works.In all fairness, the company offered to do anything to make up for the bad product, but I had already returned it to Amazon and ordered another from a different supplier.

$review_text.: I have removed my scathing posts about Belkin and the notorious Share N 300 router I bought only months ago

The old router had two laptops hardwired to it as they are both in the vicinity with the Qwest DSL modem
Both laptops have windows 7 my personal having 64 bit


One desktop computer with XP is in another room with a Belkin wireless adapter and that is how our three computers are hooked up.For some reason, the Windows 7 64 bit laptop would cause the router to lose connection when accessing some sites


I tried with Belkin support but they are like everyone else, their techs are tier 1 level and are in foreign coutries


I did get sent up a couple of times to higher tiers but still no resolve to my problem and then different techs had different ideas as to what the fix was but was told most all the time to bridge my modem


I will not do that, as it says nowhere in Belkin literature that I should have to do that.Cut to me putting rant one star reviews on Amazon

I got a reply from Belkin asking to e-mail their customer support to try and resolve my problems with their product

I e-mailed them and said OK here I am the ball is in your court

First thing that happened is that I got steered to the 600 N router

It installed easily and my HP officejet 4500 wireless printer works with all three computers.So far, I have had no problems and minimal input to the contact at Belkin that I am keeping posted but will keep in touch

This does me good for now and Belkin who now I am convinced is trying to make it right.I had to do a lot of ranting and raving to get where I am with this


It is up to you to forge your own path with resolving issues with Belkin
I think nowadays that everyone is lazier and therefore if something doesnt work then people just give up and gripe about it.I griped long and hard enough and so far so good

Thanks for now Belkin hope this keeps moving forward positively.

$review_text.: This flash is terrific
VERY POWERFUL

Takes a little experimenting with my camera which is a non TTL


Therefore, everything is set by hand
But once you have made several tests you will get the hang of it

The only thing missing is the swivel head

Zoom head and bounce flash are a plus

Got a whole lot of flashes from batteries before needing replacement

I have been using 2200mha rechargeables
The product has been around for years, but this is the newer flash which allows digital cameras to be used that need less than 12v, otherwise, using the older unit could damage a digital camera

Highly recommend it.

$REVIEW.: If you, like me, are thinking about getting this because of the GPS functionality, let me tell you: the GPS reception is poor, and the software is aweful. I would not recommend this for the GPS functionality, sad to say. Just tried using mine for the first time today, and not a single picture got GPS coordinates. I tried the map software when I got home, and the GPS logger had logged partial tracks. So I tried to export the logs to google earth so I could match it to the closest location of the images, but the software was buggy giving me errors when trying to export the logs: Can't save the google earth file in a system folder, removable disk, network, or a file with a filename that's too long. However, I tried saving it in the default location *it* suggested. This is for osx.I have had one of these which has been awesome:i-gotU USB GPS Travel & Sports Logger - GT-600battery life on it is phenomenal too. I guess I'll have to keep using this instead.

 This product could easily fly off the dashboard and hit the driver or the passenger right in the face


 And if it hits the driver [while driving of course] you could very much count on an accident to happen and more people could get hurt


 Of course it looks pretty while the car is not moving

$REVIEW.: I currently have about 20 different pairs of IEMs (and about 10 pairs of over the head cans), with everything from cheap Skullcandys up to high-dollar Atrios. And up until now, my favorite IEMs have been a $25 pair of Phillips SHE9700s. The MetroFis have now replaced them.I bought these and a set of $120 UE SuperFi 4's at the same time and gave both a thorough listen via different sources and definitely like the sound of these MetroFi's better than the more expensive buds. Not only is the bass much more defined, but the mids sound cleaner as well. The only thing I like about the SuperFis more than these, was the high end. It seemed cleaner and more crisp. This isnt to say these are bad. They are in NO WAY bad. But the SuperFi's seemed to "punch through" more.*****UPDATE: I decided to let both sets "burn in" for about 20 hours and the bass on the SuperFi's has loosend up quite a bit. Although still not as deep as the MetroFi's, the SuperFi's sound a lot better than before and I now have a hard time choosing between the SuperFi's and the MetroFi's. Which still says a lot about the sound quality of the MetroFis. But due to the increased clarity of the SuperFi's, think I'm going to use them as my mains with the MetroFis as my secondary pair.I tested these on my Second Gen iPod touch, 5th Gen iPOD Nano, various SanDisk Sansa and Clip models and a Sony NWZ-S639F. All with and without a Fiio headphone amp and found the best match was the MetroFis, the S639F and the Fiio S3 headphone amp. Now, I'm not a basshead, but like my music to sound balanced with a bit of bass boost at 60hz and lower, and this combination MORE than delivers! In fact, some of the deepest bass Ive ever heard came from this setup and a Techmaster P.E.B album (Think close to 20hz).The thing I like most about these, is unlike some of the other "fart-canon" style buds, the bass doesn't muddy the rest of the music. It stays sold and clean throughout the whole frequency band. And the fit? Spot on. I was able to use the default middle size silicone tips straight out of the package. They fit well and are equally comfortable. Every person is not the same, so UE has provided different tips to swap out if needed.My only complaint is the cord. It's kinda cheap feeling, but it's been designed "rigid" in order to help alleviate tangling.If you're looking for a clean sounding set of IEM's that have absolutely no problem with the low end, then these are for you.

$REVIEW.: If you need to create your own wireless hotspot whine on the road, in a dorm room, at a convention, etc. and you only have access to a single RJ-45 /Ethernet port, this is a compact solution' It's both reliable and simple to use. The router is a mere 2.25x2.25x.75 inches. There is a case that's the same size for holding the network cable that snaps on to the router. This is optional, but it's a handy way to store the cable without tangles or misplacing it.The router itself has a USB connector at one end with a very short cable - about 2&#34;. The opposite end of the box has the network/RJ-45 connector.  Plug in the power, plug in the network, run your wireless connection manager on your laptop, and go.There's no chance you'll lose the connection info. - there's a decal on the router with all the information.Once you connect you'll find the usual options for a wireless router - one nice feature is that this can also be used in &#34;bridge&#34; mode.  You can configure all the options manually or using wizards.Speeds are advertised as 300 MBps - but that's two streams @150 each.  Wireless N and G are both supported.There's also the handy WPS button for quick secure connection.From the manual (connection speeds):IEEE 802.11n 20 MHz BW &#60;Long GI&#62;:130/117/104/78/52/39/26/13 Mbps (2 stream)65/58.5/52/39/26/19.5/13/6.5 Mbps (1 stream)IEEE 802.11n 20 MHz BW &#60;Short GI&#62;:144.4/130/115.6/86.7/57.8/43.3/28.9/14.4 Mbps (2 stream)72.2/65/57.8/43.3/28.9/21.7/14.4/7.2 Mbps (1 stream)IEEE 802.11n 40 MHz BW &#60;Long GI&#62;:270/243/216/162/108/81/54/27 Mbps (2 stream)135/121.5/108/81/54/40.5/27/13.5 Mbps (1 stream)IEEE 802.11n 40 MHz BW &#60;Short GI&#62;:300/270/240/180/120/90/60/30 Mbps (2 stream)150/135/120/90/60/45/30/15 Mbps (1 stream)IEEE 802.11g:54/48/36/24/18/12/9/6 MbpsIEEE 802.11b:11/5.5/2/1 Mbps

 I opened up the package and followed the setup directions to the letter

 Despite this, I did run into a couple of snags in the setup that took me a bit of time to get past


 I recommend not making any changes to the router's wireless security settings until you have everything completely working wirelessly, and then only make one change at a time


 I did a benchmark speed test before removing my old equipment, and I'm very pleased to say that the speed of the new router far surpassed my old equipment
 I used to connect via Ethernet because my old wireless equipment speeds were so much slower


 Now my wireless speed is faster than what I see via Ethernet!  This router is a great performer at a great price and it looks nice too.Update:  I just purchased a second router to function as a repeater


 My home is fairly large, and my wife was having trouble getting a good signal from the other side of the house from where the original router was installed

 So, after receiving the second router, I followed the very simple directions in the user's guide to set up a repeater

 Both routers were configured in about fifteen minutes and all I had to do was select a place for the second router (now a repeater) and plug in the power
 Everything worked perfectly the first time with no issues at all
 My wife is very happy now with the signal strength from her desk.

$REVIEW.: I have owned this tester for about 1 year now, and it has performed flawlessly on both my  rechargeable (1.2 volt) and non-rechargeable (1.5 volt) AA & AAA batteries.  I cannot think of anything negative to say about this product, so I gave it a perfect 5 star rating, and highly recommend it.* Requires NO separate battery to install for it to work, (can sit in a drawer for 10 years and still be ready to give accurate readings).* Solid-state construction, (no moving parts to wear down or break like other sensitive spring-loaded needle testers).* Long-lasting LED lights, (will easily last you a lifetime before they burn-out).* Small enough to fit inside a digital camera case, (to test all those rechargeable AA's).* Makes a great gift that virtually *everyone* can use.P.S.  On a somewhat related note, if your looking for rechargeable AA's, check-out the 4.5-star "Sanyo Eneloop" batteries with 1,000+ reviews.  They are currently the best rechargeables you can buy, and will hold their charge longer than any other rechargeable currently on the market.  Or for 25% more power, look into the newer, more powerful "Eneloop XX".  (The normal Eneloop's are white, and the more powerful XX ones are black).UPDATE:  Febuary/2012.  It has been over 4 years now since my purchase, and the tester has worked flawlessly with absolutely no problems.  BTW, if you looking for a premium/top-of-the-line AA/AAA battery charger, I humbly recommend you check-out the 4.5-star "La Crosse BC-700" (with 400+ reviews).  I've had it for over a year now and it works great!  A bit pricey, but it's the best out there, and cutting-edge technology doesn't come cheap. Simply put, nothing will top-off a battery better, and it will not overcharge your batteries like cheaper charges will.

$REVIEW.: I'm typing on this keyboard right now.  The best thing about it is the feel of the keys.  I feel like I can type faster and more accurately with this keyboard now that I've gotten used to it.  It's kind of like a notebook computer, but better because it's a full size keyboard.  The keys are quiet, good sized, and take a small amount of force to press.  The keyboard is  lightweight and doesn't take up a lot of desk space.  This keyboard does indeed look pretty cool.  I'm using Linux, so the multimedia/web keys aren't all that useful, but they do work if you want them to (at least in KDE on Gentoo).I upgraded from an OEM Microsoft Natural Keyboard Pro.

$REVIEW.: I have come accustomed to Amazon's and or LinkSys' claims that its adapters have this unbelieveable signal range from Router. With my experience with this LinkSys WPC11 Wireless-B Notbook Adapter as well as the Linksys WUSB11 Wireless-B USB Network Adapter is that they do not have the 300 to 400 ft range as they claim. I get dismal signal strength when I have these adapters over 50 ft from the Router. If I dare to go 50ft or farther from the Router, the strength drops to &quot;poor&quot; or just completely drops off.One aggravating and costly solution to this problem is to buy the LinkSys WSB24 Wireless-B Signal Booster. Though this product is not available on Amazon, I bought mine for a whopping $50 at Circuit City. The furthest successful signal range (or get the &quot;very good&quot; signal readings on my adapters) WITH THE $50 SIGNAL BOOSTER is about 100 ft. The furthest successful signal range WITHOUT A BOOSTER is about 50ft. So this product gets 3 stars for its poor signal range and costly solution to the problem.

$review_text.: Pros: No cords or wires, just plug it into an outlet.Cons: It doesn't work. It seems very glitchy, you sometimes get to the Internet, but most often do not. There is no user guide whatsoever, either in the box or available online (although the enclosed installation guide makes reference to downloading it).  Tech support is terrible. You could put this thing right next to your router, and it would still tell you it's too far away.Summary: Don't waste your time. If want something reliable to extend my wifi signal to all parts of the house, or at least that has a user guide to help you figure out what wrong in the haphazard times it does not work. Easy to set-up, hard to get it to recognize your router or work. After spending a night finally getting it to put out a signal it would not provide the computers it connected to with Internet connectivity. Wasted a night troubleshooting with Tech Support (which is a misnomer, because NetGear's tech support is some 3rd party employee who couldn't even tell me what the product looked like, sitting in a boiler room in the Philippines and reading from a standard troubleshooting guide. Documentation was scant, website FAQ and troubleshooting is practically non-existant. Tech support is a joke - really I won't even do business with NetGear again because their tech support is so bad. You would think they'd realize that sourcing this out to some third world company who's employees can't even tie their own shoes is loosing them more business, and resulting in more returned product, than providing non-existent technical support is saving them.Very disappointed.

$review_text.: I'm not sure why buyers pay exhorbitant prices for HDMI cables.  I purchased this cable for a Canon Vixia HF200 camcorder and it works fine.  It is well-made, very sturdy, and the 10' length allows you to sit well away from the TV during playback.  Most significantly, its cost was about one-fourth the price of a "premium" cable.  I had a very similar experience with a previous Amazon purchase for the HDMI cable we use for our TV. It appears that good quality cables can be manufactured and sold for a reasonable price.

$review_text.: I just installed this after having several different routers in the past

 I'm very impressed in the range and speed already

 It's not only able to handle 50mb of full bandwidth, it does so with ease while streaming from a few different computers at once.I live in a townhome where my modem is on the top floor (with main router) and different wireless connectors around the house, including the basement
 While my wife watched netflix on my main computer while browsing the internet, I still had incredible connectivity in the basement (3 floors down), when playing XBOX
 The QoS option is pretty reliable as well, for those who like to game
 Throw in your port for XBL and it'll make sure it gets priority over anything else.One of the only problems I had was with the software, which wasn't compatible with 64bit or Windows 7


 If you know much about routers, it's not really a problem


 Just plug it in, go to the standard address and log in with an admin user/pass..

the wizard is in there (if you want it)
 Nonetheless, setup was still easy.The Dual band option requires a separate SSID and seems to not have as much range for 300 as 150
 Sitting 10 feet from the router I get 4 out of 5 bars, which tends to be standard with dual band 5gz routers


 It still screams from 50-60 feet though.Overall, it's the best router I've used (outside of Cisco 800 series and up).

The only Amazon branding on the item can be found on the zipper pulls, which is fine by me.

 In addition to extending the wifi signal across my condo, I use this to plug in my Tivo, Blu-Ray player, and my Sharp TV, so that everything has internet access for content streaming (ie


youtube, Netflix, etc) and for software updates for my A/V equipment.So far, so good!  This extender (which I've located in the center of my condo) transmits the wifi signal throughout, and connects my devices to the internet

$REVIEW.: I purchased the Craig Tablet primarily to receive e-mail over my home Wi-Fi connection. The size of the tablet makes it an ideal alternative to cranking up my desktop, or unpacking my notebook, during the limited time I have before leaving for work. The Craig Android does a very good job retrieving messages from five separate accounts, including Web access to a secure work account. The Internet speed is adequate and the screen display is very functional. Web surfing is also very serviceable. The seven inch screen makes full size Web sites surprisingly legible.The Documents To Go app allows me to view and edit Microsoft Office documents and Adobe PDF files, which is a nice addition. The video viewer works great with AVI files and the audio player does a fair job with earbuds attached.I didn't purchase this tablet to play games, or read books. I don't expect it to compare to a high price tablet.  I purchased it for under fifty dollars from Amazon Marketplace and it's well worth that price.

$review_text.: This camera is a great recorder, but I had to go through a few of them before I found one that worked for me.  When I got my first one, I looked at the image on a resolution chart and the right side of the image was soft, so back to Amazon.  Second camera came and it was soft on the left, back that one went.  On the third time I got a great camera and lens,  I am just  leaving two stars, because I had to go through so many returns with Amazon, they almost closed my account.  But in the end it is the best HD camera I have used any where close to this price.  I would suggest buying one where you can try it out with a focus test chart before buying, of course where would that be...  I also found the accessories (extra battery, and memory) a bit expensive, and the front auto lens cap looks like it could be fragile, and probably should have some sort of protection for it.It might be better to buy it used, and ask about the optics before just buying a new one, and hoping to get a coconut.

$REVIEW.: (**The one star review is not for the quality of this device, more as a notice to it not being compatible with samsung devices**)I think I know why every one after January 2011 is having problems with this adapter and their Samsung products
It seems as though Intellinet has switched their product but kept the same model number


I too read the reviews and bought this for my c5500 blu ray player or c650 tv and neither worked


When I went back and looked there are actually 2 models of this thing! One has a square end and one has a round end

The one that worked for everybody seems to have the square end, and the new one that doesn't work for anyone has the round end
Seems pretty shady to make a different product but keep the same model number if you ask me


I'm going to try and confirm this by purchasing the square end model at micro center to see
Although I'm pretty sure it is

I'll update when I find out.**Update**Went to Micro Center to pick one up and they only had one of the square end versions left, but someone had stolen the dongle and left the box on the shelf


Just my luck
Either way I wouldn't trust ordering this model anymore
Sounds like the only other option is the Rosewill RNX-N1
The D-Link DWA-140 may also work as I searched and found it had the same chipset as the Samsung and the Rosewill but its not really that much cheaper depending where you go

Its not really worth the hassle anymore, so I may just give in and get the Samsung version just because I'm tired of these things not working.

$REVIEW.: I've been searching for a good pair of headphones to wear while running since the standard iPod headphones fall out of my ears.  These are not worth buying if you're looking for headphones to wear while being active.  I ended up taking mine back and bought theseSony Mdr-As20J Active Style Headphones with Soft Loop Hangers (Black)instead.These are completely worthless for running.  I had to adjust them about every 30 seconds because they'd shift on my ears and felt like they were falling out.  About 10 minutes into my run when I started getting a little sweaty (and I don't think I sweat more than the average runner), the little inner ear bud started slipping out, which caused the whole thing to just slip off my ear.  I put them back on, only to have them fall off again about 10 seconds later.  I ended up just taking them off and continuing without music.  Highly disappointing.  Also, the cord is a little heavier than normal, which causes them to jiggle around.  And, every time I picked them up, the cord was in a huge tangled mess.  I really dislike these headphones.As I mentioned, I took mine back almost immediately so I can't rate the quality, but it seems as if most people are unhappy about their durability.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend these, especially for runners or other active people.  For those looking for a simple pair of headphones for non-active uses, you can probably find something that costs less and is better than these.  I was definitely disappointed and the Sony brand didn't live up to its name this time around.

$REVIEW.: Nothing against Amazon  but the seller of this unit is a joke ! I ordered THIS unit because it had 3 sets of RCA ports . I received a  &#34;quote upgrade&#34; to a newer model, well the unit they sent me only had only 2 sets RCA ports. No good for me cause I am running 2 amps and I don't want to use Y spliters . I contacted the seller and they said to send it back then they can START the return process! Yea B.S I took it to a local stereo store and traded it in on a Kenwood . Never again will I buy from this seller.

$REVIEW.: Medialink Wireless N Router - 802.11n - 150 Mbps - 2.4 GhzOur 7-year old Linksys WRT54GS wouldn't recognize the network adapter in our new ACER laptop, so I bought this router.  We use Comcast cable for the Internet and TV.This is a wired/wireless router, since it allows "hard-wiring" (via RG-45 Ethernet cables) directly to 1, 2, 3, or 4 PCs/devices, in addition to supporting your wireless network.  We have two desktops connected via Ethernet cables and a laptop that connects via our personal WiFi network this thing creates.  It worked the 1st time right out of the box with no hassles.It comes with a CD for installation, but it wasn't needed.  No device drivers or software is required on any PC for this thing to work!  The entire installation took about 10 minutes, and half of that time was activating the wireless capability.  Give a name to your wireless network (default is "medialink") and provide a password for its use - that's about it.  Immediately after that, our laptop "found" the new network and asked for the "security code"; I entered our password, and was instantly on the Internet.  With the router in an upstairs bedroom and the laptop in the first floor dining room, the signal strength was 5 out of 5 bars.  The setup reminded me of the giant EASY button that Staples advertises...Unlike the Linksys, which required me to know all kinds of technical stuff to set it up (which meant calling our ISP), you don't need to know anything technical for this model - just follow the instructions that come with this router.

$review_text.: I saw all the rave reviews from both buyers and camera review sites on the K5 so I just had to have it
I recently sold my Nikon D90 and was in need of an upgrade.The ergonomics of the K5 are JUST great


It makes you want to pick it up and use it


The weight, the solid build, LCD, and all the buttons seem to be in the right place REALLY great

A sort of non issue, out of the box I had two hot pixels
Thanks though to the in camera pixel mapping a BIG advantage over the Nikon D7000, I had a perfect camera in seconds after just clicking pixel remap.My problems with the K5 are I had way too many pictures where it focused behind what I wanted IT to focus on, OR focused REALLY on nothing

Despite the fact it LOOKED focused in either the viewfinder and or live view


I set it to one point certainly not multi

(I shot a lot of People shots) Unless I was very close to the subject(s) OR "if the subject didn't have a lot of things close by behind" like trees etc.,over and over the K5 had really focused behind my target.I tend to shoot a lot in places of nature like Arboretums etc..so it's then when I noticed the most out of focus shots, when the background was sort of busy
If I was shooting a portrait shot, say by the Ocean, I always had PERFECT sharp focus as there was nothing CLOSE behind my subject like a tree obviously.Another thing that bothered me on the K5 was it's OVERALL rendition of skin tones

I know certain settings are out of the box too saturated with too much contrast but most pictures no matter what I did, had unrealistic skin tones.In raw I was usually able to get VERY good skin tone but I hated to ALWAYS have to manipulate nearly every picture I took in order to get realistic looking skin tones.Fast Forward, I was getting frustrated with the focus and COLOR accuracy

I picked up a Nikon D7000 and without doing a whole review, without question the D7000 had way better accurate auto focus in most situations, and much better looking ACCURATE color, especially skin tones


(This was MY experience don't shoot the messenger :))Long story short without a doubt I enjoyed the overall feel and customization level much more on the K5 vs the Nikon

Also high ISO goes to the K5

As to grain or Chroma noise my tests showed the K5 was the winner over the D7000 which was close.However due to the focus and skin tone issues I sadly returned my K5 and will be keeping the D7000


There is no doubt the Pentax is a SUPER great camera


I suppose if you enjoy a ton of post processing it will reward you big time


The auto focus issue? I don't know..I missed far too many shots that should have been in focus..and that's probably the main reason I chose the D7000 over the Pentax.This is just my opinion, and from what I've read the K5 usually comes up the winner

However due to the issues I listed at least in my case, the D7000 was the better camera for ME though not ergonomically
Also as far as the initial kit lenses go, if you buy these cameras with the kit lens..the K5'S lens will show MUCH more purple fringing, The D7000 wins again on the kit lens

Not an issue if you plan to buy some good glass as they say with your camera
All said though, the K5 is a great camera, but you may want to try a D7000 and see if it may not be the better camera in the REAL WORLD..Not dxo charts, shooting manikins in a studio, and all that sort of thing.I know there are some die hard Pentax people out there I can see why, as Pentax seems riddled with QUALITY and is a bit DIFFERENT than the same old boring? Nikon/ Canons
I am actually the type who PREFERS to be different, (I have an X100 LOVE IT!! I won't even go there now)


I WANTED to choose the K5 over the D7000 but my pictures wouldn't let me do that..JUST my eyes and opinion.

$review_text.: I bought this extra memory for my Samsung Galaxy S4


 I wish I had known when I bought my phone that Android changed its memory management technique between Gingerbread and Jelly Bean!  Verizon sold me a 16GB Samsung S4
 I didn't do much research since my old phone broke and I was about to leave on a business trip the next day

 Come to find out, there are 32 and 64GB versions of the Galaxy S4!  I never asked Verizon if they even carried different versions
 Well, I figured that wouldn't be a problem..


I'll just put in a 64GB Micro SD (TF) Card and I'll be all set
 Unfortunately you can no longer transfer Apps to the Micro SD Card

 Some apps can store data on the SD Card but there is no longer the ability to "Move to SD."  Since I travel internationally, I use a lot of GPS mapping software and would like to download multiple Gigs of map data for offline mapping

 As of now, I can only download this to my phone's 16GB memory, and not to this 64GB memory card!  Pictures (except for burst photos), videos and music can all be put on the 64GB SD card

 All that being said, this memory card works well, and is priced on par with all of the other comparable cards on the market

 If you've got the cash and need the space (for music, videos/movies and/or pictures--just not apps) then I recommend picking one of these up.

Because there was only 1 slot, I had to buy a new SATA HD - no problem as my old HD was only 80GB and was slow. I was able to reconfigure my PSU to work with this motherboard.

$REVIEW.: ThoseUniden FRS/GMRS Two-Way Radio Pair (GMR1635-2)are so compact, you can easily hold both in one hand. They are also very inexpensive, so one may think of them as just toys for kids, But in fact they can be used by kids and adults alike - provided that you start with the correct expectation.First of all, forget about the manufacturer's claim of '16-mile' range. That is only possible under the most optimistic test condition (transmitting from one hill top to another with clear line-of-sight). In an urban environment, you are lucky if you can get one or two miles. With this limited range in mind, this walkie talkie set can still be very useful in many places (such as in a National Park, or a large shopping mall). The sound quality is quite decent - similar to an AM radio.Next, this thing is a battery-eater if you use disposable alkaline cells (three AAA per radio). The manufacturer claims an average battery life of '20 hours'. But again, this is under a special test condition of '5/5/90', which means 5% transmit, 5% receive, and 90% idle time. The device consumes different amount of current during different operation modes, as shown below:- While transmitting: 400mA- While receiving: 50-100mA (depending on volume level)- While idling: around 15mA.If you do a lot of transmission, a set of alkaline cells is likely to run flat in less than two hours (because alkaline cells are very inefficient at high current). My advice is to buy some good quality AAA rechargeable cells (such asSanyo Eneloop) to power those radios. That way, not only will you save money on batteries, you can even get longer run time per charge.

$review_text.: Okay, first let me get some things out of the way.I'm a techie who loves computers, but also tries to save a lot.  I actually purchased this ultrabook for very, very cheap from a Staples clearance, so I'm probably happier than most for this.I basically needed a light, portable laptop with sufficient processing power that I could bring to college - and for this purpose, this is PERFECT.But I would say that this Ultrabook doesn't give the "full" ultrabook experience.  As always, you get what you pay for.My review has a theme - and that is, its a great ultraportable, but not the premium experience you might expect from an ultrabook.Screen - Its merely decent.  Its not the worst I've seen, but far from the best.  I'm hoping next year we will see IPS displays standard.  Viewing angles are not very good, but decent enough so that you don't have to constantly adjust.  I expect this category to improve a lot in future ultrabooks.  For the price, I'm satisfied.  However, there IS an issue with the screen wobbling.  The hinge is simply too weak for this!  I've tried many other ultrabooks and they have far sturdier hinges.  Acer really needs to improve this, as the screen can jiggle constantly if it is not on a perfectly steady surface.Processor - Fast.  You don't really need to worry here, unless youre trying to do graphics/video processing.  Its very speedy for browsing/word processing/youtube.  Although its a last-gen i5, the newer gen isnt THAT much faster (Ivy bridge is just a die shrink of Sandy bridge + better graphics)Keyboard/trackpad - While other reviewers had gripes here, I actually LOVE the trackpad and find the keyboard fine.  The trackpad is programmable so you can do quite a bit with it.  I find it responsive, accurate, and fairly smooth.  Its not glass (but plastic), so its not super smooth like some other ultrabooks, but its good enough.  As for the keyboard, I also find it to be a nice typing experience.  The key travel isnt much, but its better than some other ultra thin ultrabooks, and sufficient once you get used to it (and this is coming from a person who uses a mechanical desktop keyboard).  I applaud Acer on their design here, as I find both the keyboard and trackpad to be of fantastic quality for a ultrabook in this price range.Battery life - Disappointed here.  I expect next-years ultrabooks to last much, much longer.  It only lasts about 3-4 hours depending on your usage.  I would like to see 6 hours minimum on high brightness levels/usage.. 3rd gen Ultrabooks are going to be spec'd minimum at '9' hours, so I'm expecting to buy another ultrabook next year.  As for their claim of 6 hours, that is pretty much if you have WiFi off and edit a word document on the lowest brightness settings.  Otherwise I could not see it happening.Build quality - Is fine.  Better than your average notebook, but worse than many other ultrabooks.  In general, it feels as sturdy as a regular notebook.  I found no flexing that would bother me.Noise level - This is actually my main problem here.  This ultrabook can get irritating in a quiet bedroom.  The fan spools up and has a high pitched noise, even when doing web browsing.  This is one part that really needs to be addressed.  This and the battery life is why I docked a star.To summarize, I gave this 4 stars because while it is imperfect, I don't expect perfect for the price of being the cheapest ultrabook on the market.  1 full star was docked because the fan has a high pitched noise, and the battery life should be at least 5 hours according to ultrabook spec, but it isnt.

This item came in an open cellophane bag with no end protector included.  Suspect that the sellers buy in bulk and then repackage batteries for sale and shipping.  Who knows?  Maybe they sell the end protector separately.  It says Nikon on the battery and we hope that it is truly a Nikon battery because it wasn't supplied like the usual ones.

$REVIEW.: If you just need to connect a few devices to wi-fi this will work fine for you.  I was able to connect several devices to the 5ghz and 2.4ghz bands and the connections seemed steady and fast enough.  The range is nothing special but certainly sufficient for an average size house.If you want to use an Apple TV on your network, however, RUN AWAY and find another solution.  Simply Google &#34;linksys e2500 airplay&#34; and you'll find several forum discussions and blog posts about how Apple's Airplay(tm) is completely broken with this product.  Long story short, Airplay doesn't work without making serious compromises with this router (e.g. no 5ghz or N connections).  And the biggest problem is, trying to use Airplay with the E2500 can kill your entire network -- wi-fi AND wired -- forcing a reboot of the router to restore service.  It's quite amazing.I wish I'd seen those posts before ordering this since Apple TV is a big part of my networking.  Thank goodness for Amazon's generous return policy.

$REVIEW.: Let me preface this by saying I come from the "old school" of photography.  I've use good-quality film SLR cameras for years, and have always hated digitals because of all the cumbersome controls and lack of good manual control of the camera (yes, even on digital SLRs).This camera is quite an improvement.  If you are just a point-and-shooter, you can take it out of the box, throw batteries and an SD card in it and just click away.  But if you know what you are doing with a camera, there are good manual controls in here for you, too, and that's what I want to focus on.If you need to take close-up shots of small models, insects, flowers, etc this is the camera for you.  If you want something tiny and slim just for snapping pics on vacation, this is NOT the camera for you.  It will do a superb job, but it's more than you need and therefore bulkier than you probably want.It has shutter and aperture priority - the latter being the most important.  You can manually stop down the lens anywhere from 2.6 to 8.0.  It wish it would stop all the way down to, like f/22, but that's a lot to ask for a $200 digicam.  In macro mode, it really truly can focus on things only 1 cm away from the lens, and the focus is still crisp - very impressive.Put this thing on a tripod, put a good light on your subject, turn the flash OFF, use the built-in timer to avoid shaking the camera, and you'll get magazine-publishable photos, and that's no lie.White balance is superb.  You can take shots under flourescent, incandescent, tungsten (photofloods) and the color rendition is terrific, even if you use the "auto" white balance.  But you can manually calibrate it if you really want to.  There are also several preset white balance settings (flourescent, incandescent, tungsten, and about 4 others).It runs on 4 AA batteries, so you can shoot a long time before the batteries are dead, but definitely invest in 4 NiMH AA's and a charger.It uses standard SD cards, not like those morons at Sony who insist on using a proprietary memory card in their cameras.The best thing about it is that all the real controls you need if you are used to using a real camera are easily accessible right at the top level buttons - exposure compenstation, macro mode, flash on/off, f/stop.There is also a full manual mode, so you can set f/stop, exposure, shutter speed and focus all completely manually.  I fooled with some of the DSLRs, and those "mid-range" hybrid models like the S3 (sort of in between the things like this A630 and a DSLR).  Frankly, they are agony to use.  If I spend $800-$1000 on a DSLR, I do not expect it to punish me to find how to change the *(&#$@_)&*  f/stop!A 4x true optical zoom is a pretty darn good range in a small cam, as well.The door where the USB hooks up is kind of cheap feeling, but I won't know for a long time whether it will hold up or not.  Video shoots a smooth, crisp, non-grainy 30 frames per second in normal room light.  Nice.The LCD is large, bright, and clear, and it flips out to the side of the camera (if you like that sort of thing).  I don't know why a few people complained about it.Hooking to a computer - If you've got a Mac with OS/X, don't bother installing ANYTHING that comes with the camera.  Just plug the camera into your USB port, and use the Mac's built in camera application.  It will pull the photos off neatly in to a folder, and even delete them from the camera for you if you want.  This is another nice plus.  Who needs those silly bloated custom applications that come with these cameras?  (And BTW, I am a computer software engineer by trade.)I first tried an A550 (also a nice cam) and exchanged it at the store for this A630, because the 550 doesn't have the manual exposure controls I needed.  For the extra $30 in price, the A630 is an enormous step up in quality and controls, well worth $30 more.
$review_summary.: Excellent optics, macro range,good manual controls

$review_text.: It's sleek, glitzy, beautiful, with great sound... but that's for people who just want music.I'm a pod-cast listener. I like to download the news and other programs (mostly NPR and BBC) so that I can listen while I'm on the run, commuting, shopping, and so on.What I need is something very easy to use and operate by tactile control,  so that I don't have to take my eyes off the road or anything else.  I'm still using a battered old Zen Nano that's literally held together by scotch tape because (1) its controls for cueing, skipping, deleting and all other forms of navigating, are performed by a sort of "joy stick" that I can feel and operate without looking, and (2) it comes in a case that clips to my belt.This product has neither. I bought this in the hope that I could finally retire my battered old Zen. No such luck. This item, gorgeous as it is, will probably spend the rest of its life in some drawer... or until I can find a teenager to give it to.This is the first device I've had in a long time for which I actually had to read the entire (41-page) manual before I could use it proficiently, and I take that as a very bad sign because I can't remember the last device I ever bought that required more than a cursory glance at the instructions, if any, to use it effectively. Several deficiencies were so glaringly bad that I had to see it for myself in print, such as the fact that you can't delete a track without hooking it up to a computer and deleting it from there.Aside from the podcast-related issues, there are aspects of its ergonomics that really need improving, like menu navigation and better button design.PS - Can anyone suggest a good replacement for my Zen that has the features I need? I bought the Zen Muvo, but its plug-in USB interface and slower transfer speeds are not friendly to my setup at home. If you send your advice to mattgb1 at gmail dot com, I'd appreciate it.

$review_text.: I bought this because it was inexpensive and to see if my WRT54G was, in fact, dying


My home network has been suffering with frequent disconnects from AT&T DSL

The line checked okay with the modem (Motorola 2200-02-1006) plugged into the computer, so the WRT54G became the #1 suspect
Played with cables, phone lines, filters, and the Linksys settings & firmware with no change


In contrast, the N150R has been connected to the same IP address for over 2 days and counting
(The WRT54G is a very fine product

I got mine years ago and always left it on
It served me well and will be retired with full honors.) Setting up the N150R was a snap: connected it to both the modem (already in bridge mode) and my computer with ethernet cables, turned it on, opened a web browser, and the darn thing identified my dsl modem and provided on screen boxes to enter my user name and password
I was logged back into AT&T and on the internet in about as long as it takes to read this


(It even changed its address so as not to conflict with the modem address.) Later on I tinkered around in its menu, set things up as I like them, and backed up the configuration

It works with everything at home: PCs w/ b & g wireless, ipod, laptops, DSs, etc..


So, so far, very good.

$review_text.: I'm pleased with this USB adapter; it allows me to pick up signals from quite far away with relatively little effort. The smaller five inch antenna is good for in-home networks, and the large 12 inch antenna allows me to pick up a hotspot about 1,200 feet away. I only get a couple of bars on the far-away hot spot, because the signal goes through several houses to get to me. Still very impressive!The installation was super-easy. On both Windows 7 you can plug this little guy in and it runs right off the bat, no CD required. On Vista and XP you may have to use the driver CD installer (takes 1 to 2 minutes on a slower machine).I do wish the actual adapter was physically smaller. I don't feel comfortable leaving it plugged into my laptop with the twelve inch antenna; it's too heavy and might bend the USB port. A shorter adapter would give the antenna less leverage to bend the port up. The five inch antenna is fine, though.The USB extender with the interchangeable clip and suction cup is a nice touch. It's a bit awkward if you clip it on to the top of your laptop's lid; luckily my ASUS is thin enough to clip it on the side. The suction cup works well for attaching it to the window next to my desktop, so that I can pick up my friend's wireless network or said wireless hotspot from a block away!Overall a very good product for the price.

$REVIEW.: I needed an amp for my workshop with a bit more power than most typical receivers have. It's a big, dead area and I run it loud.Now...I've bought a few Pyle products, and I am already aware that they dramatically over-rate the power of their amps. This is not a 3100 watt amp; it's own real RMS ratings are 380 per channel at 8 ohms, and I suspect it's more like 200 per channel in reality. But I was expecting that, so let's move on.I was concerned when I first got it because it had somewhat of a burning smell, but that seems to have stopped.Actually...the amp sounds pretty good. Not audiophile grade by any mean; but fairly clean and warm sounding. For the price, I am satisfied. It drives my shop speakers well and at the volume levels I was looking for.Time will tell whether or not it holds up; Pyle's reputation there isn't the best. But if it does, it's a good deal.

$review_text.: I bought this as a supplement to my ipad which I use at work a lot and wanted something for home.  I prefer android over apple for the freedom.  I picked this over some of the other 7 inchers for two primary reasons it has an expandable sd port and it had the IR port and the peel smart remote software.  So far the device has been great.  it synced up with my gmail account and all my application settings from my HTC android phone.  I'm giving it 4 stars because the remote software is OK but it is not a replacement as a universal remote if you are used to the harmony programmable remotes.  It doesn't provide the ability to program the remote buttons or run multiple devices without turning them on manually (via the remote).  OK, but not great.  The Peel software needs some work to make it a replacement as a universal remote.  The best feature of the Peel software is the ability to sync with you TV services provider and find whats on TV.  It is a better guide in that respect.

In fact, this little might-might after being well tightened held my lens and camera steady even though it was slowly rotated vertically through 180 degrees.  Even the plates designed specifically for the camera didn't work that well. The D-Ring (tool-less) tightener is a great add.The only reasons I didn't give it 5 stars are the following two nits:1. The slot on the d-ring is too small to insert a quarter (or penny). Sometimes the extra torque you get from pocket change helps to tighten or loosen the plate.2. It's really small which makes it a bit more fidgety to get it on an arca style clamp, and it also means that you may need to mount it at right angles to what you'd normally do in order to get the most surface contact with the camera.
$SUMMARY.: Small and Mighty... The grippy rubber saves the finish (and improves the grip)

$REVIEW.: when I first used the VHS part the tape had to be forced in to work


After that it works fine

The machine seams to be working fine no problems so far, hope never.I still like the sony DVD and VHS combo recorder I still have


The sony lets you see how much of the show is left and also how much you used
Also the sony rewinds alot faster then the Toshiba
And the Sony when it stops rewinding it slows down to a crawl then stops compared to the Toshiba that bangs.Seams like its a good machine.

$REVIEW.: Check the back of your controllers

Be aware that if they are SNS-005 models you are rolling the dice
Based on testing in my Game Controller settings in Windows 7 64-bit with two SNS-005 controllers


One of my controllers works fine with all buttons regardless of which slot it is plugged into the adapter


My other controller will ONLY work in the left slot, and ONLY if it is the only controller plugged in

If it is in the right slot it only the B button works

If it is in the left slot it works until you plug another controller in then only the B button works
I will be ordering an exchange through to test one more adapter..


if the issue persists then I know it's because the problematic controller (which works fine in the SNES) is incompatible


The compatibility issues should be mentioned in the product description like how third party controllers are not guaranteed to work


If the next adapter works, I'll add another star, but if I have to order another controller to get 2-player working the 3 star review will remain.

$REVIEW.: I really like the product, and the price is great, but my current one has died again.These are very popular in my family. I have one for my Dad, Mom, and Wife. My wife had an earlier model where the headphone jack would intermittently go to &#34;mono&#34; or even cut out on one ear. I opened it up, and had to do a solder repair on a cracked solder joint on the jack. Well.....two years later and with this model I am in the same spot. Given that my previous repair only added about 4 months of life to the last one, I will probably just get another. That says a lot about the product:-Good menus-Good sound-Small, with a sturdy little clip-Expandable with MicroSD-Great value....if only they could make a headphone jack that doesn't break at the solder joint?

$review_text.: This is a great system for its price like everyone else mentioned in their reviews. Few things to note:- The speaker / sound bar is really small and light, but does deliver very clear sound. It has one cord (speaker) coming out of it connecting to the subwoofer. I found it best to mount it above my TV for better sound distribution. It has nail holes in the back so you could just hang it like a picture frame. For reference, my room is approx 13x20 with a 9ft ceiling.- The subwoofer was much bigger (1.5 ft in height) than I expected, although given all the inputs it receives, it made sense. I have it next to my TV stand so it being wired wasn't an issue for me. I have everything hooked up to it via HDMI, and one single HDMI cable going to my TV. With ARC enabled, an optical fiber audio cable was not necessary.- As with many reviews, at first I found the max volume to be too soft, but with some use (and ARC enabled), the volume seemed to have been "broken in". I now regularly have the volume level set to 20 at night, or 30 if I'm watching a good film. (Max is 50).- It is not a 5.1 surround system, so often times I felt it lacked rear speakers (but I also have open walls on one side of my room). For a sound bar at approx $200, this thing is great. I can't really distinguish different audio channels even though the sound bar has three speakers built-in, but it's much better than the TV speakers... there's just no comparison.- I'm using it with a LG 55LW5600 TV set, and with Simplink enabled, I am able to control the sound bar volume with my LG remote. Unfortunately, can't use the same remote to power on the device or to switch inputs. The Sony remote control is a bit complicated to use...- High def and 3D signal isn't a problem at all using this as an HDMI switch, but the manual does mention to make sure you have the latest type of HDMI cable (high speed, revision 1.4). I think I'm using 1.3, but not sure...anyway, it works for me and I have no issues with audio/video not syncing. I haven't noticed any lags.Anyway, great buy from Amazon. I bought it "Like New" sold by Amazon Warehouse and it arrived a couple of days earlier than expected. It was basically an open box item, but item was still unpacked so it was indeed "like new". Very happy with purchase and highly recommended if you are looking for a sound bar that is about $200.

$review_text.: As population density increases it is helpful to your sanity to be able to live in your own bubble of sound isolation. I purchased these headphones for this purpose, since they have one of the highest listed percentages of noise cancellation (NC). They work as advertised. Also I have learned to like the high quality of physical design by Panasonic engineers, who do not design products that fall apart.  At a price of $85, they are mid-level, and it requires some study to decide who makes the optimum affordable headphone for your purpose.With that in mind I am rating three noise cancelling headphones that I own (purchased from Amazon), with a pair of numbers inserted in the term [fidelity / noise-cancellation]. Higher numbers mean higher performance.Price  Model  fidelity / noise cancellation$85.  Panasonic RP-HC720K  1/3$145  Sony MDR-NC200D  2/2$130  Sennheiser PXC 250  3/1Of these three the Sennheiser have the highest fidelity, but a more modest degree of noise cancellation. Sennheiser produces remarkable presence and I feel like I am sitting in a concert hall. The Panasonic have the highest degree of noise cancellation, and the sound fidelity is fine for speech in an aviation environment. If you want to optimize both features, the Sony with its extensive digital processing is a good choice, but you will not match the fidelity of the Sennheiser which is in a class of its own.Lurking in the background is the NC headphone manufactured by Bose. I cannot afford to try this headphone, and Bose, along with other NC manufacturers, does not provide technical information. It is strictly an issue of &#34;try it and you will like it&#34;. My evaluations above, are strictly subjective.But you should be sure that you need NC technology. Otherwise the NC money is much better put into a professional DJ headphone. Still, as I indicated in the beginning, the noise technology is here that we can escape from noise pollution in a crowded environment, for peace of mind.

$REVIEW.: I bought this for my router that gets hot.First the size is for netbooks so it is small and absolutely perfect for my router, so for that I was very pleased.It has a USB connector to supply power and this is the only cord which is nice
There are no fan speed adjustments but it keeps my device nice and cool and is quiet so I cant complain about this.Only thing is I paid less than $10 for this so for that price it is awesome

It is labeled as being around 25-30 normally and I guess I would buy if I had to, but I would at that point feel like it was overpriced

So basically wait till you can get this at a good price and go for it


If you do have to pay full, I guess it would be a good purchase but I would be pissed if I had to pay $30 bucks for this thing.

$review_text.: I had an old large 19 inch monitor that I had for at least 18 years.  I have been looking for and reviewing a replacement for over 6 months.  Wanting a low electric usage and well known company that make these monitors.  I personally have had good luck with HP products.  I like the black look, product seems very stable on desk, the picture brightness seems great, received product quickly (only problem was went to neighbors house instead to mine from I believe UPS), price was better than fantastic at the time I got it (from other products I looked at), and as usual Amazon is my favorite place to shop on the net.  I know it will not support 3D.  From other literature that I observed, 60 Hz is fine for this size screen.  If you want to have it support HDMI, you will need to buy your own cable.  But these are offered at Amazon at very reasonable prices.  Would suggest this product to anyone who wants an LED monitor with a nice large screen from a company that usually makes a great product.

$REVIEW.: Hey there! I bought this Kensington Keyfolio Pro II for taking notes while at IRCE last week. I absolutely love it!!I appreciate that the folks at Kensington designed the keyboard to shut itself off when not in use!I also like the Home button they included on the keyboard to help get back to the home screen.The only reason I didn't give this a 5 Star rating is because the corners are already wearing. The leather is no longer visible on the corners. The only other wear that is happening after a week's use, is the elastic band that holds the Folio closed when not in use. The elastic band fabric is beading.As for the keyboard, it's flawless and is just the right size.PROS:+Keyboard immediately connects via Bluetooth when turned on+Keyboard has no issues with connection and mis-typing any letters+Battery Life is great and runs for a solid 8 hours+Home Button makes it easy to quickly access other Apps+Short Keys are very helpful along the Top for Playing Music, jumping to Camera, Search, Volume, etcCONS:-Leather is wearing on Corners after (1) Week's use-Elastic Band Fabric is wearing and beading after (1) Week's use

The fact that it has WIFI built in and it has all the APPS(Netflix, VUDU, MLB.TV and PICASA) that I currently need is a definite plus.  I am not a audophile, videophile or any other kind of phile, so I can't explain why this new technology takes 20+ seconds to start up?  I know that 20 seconds is only 20 seconds but isn't this 2011 and aren't we suppose to be flying cars?  The start up time is my only complaint.  The picture quality is purely amazing on my new LG LED TV.  The CES show was starting today and after going to CNET and ENGADGET's websites and seeing what LG has in store for the near future(downloadable apps, web surfing and a few other little tricks), I would be willing to bet that this player will be dropping in price fairly quickly.

$REVIEW.: OK, I love my flash, It functions so well and its' versatility is superb. Strong and powerful light when needed and soft light when not needed. My only complaint thus far after about 2 years I think, the red indicator light in the back should be green when the flash is charged and ready and red until such. Instead, the light is red when ready and off while charging the flash. This makes it so difficult to know when your batteries are running low on charge. If the light was I described, I would be able to discern when my batteries were low on charge as the red light would indicate to me that it's taking a while to charge the flash and &#34;Hold on&#34; don't take that picture yet. I know its almost the same as off and red but, red for not ready and green for ready makes better sense. Bad choice and not universal with red stop.. green go..... Sorry Canon, you messed up on this one.

$review_text.: [UPDATE]More praise for CheetaMounts!  I was able to return the original Head which I believed to be defective.  I spoke with the service rep and he was very help and understanding.  I RMA'd the Head and got the replacement very quickly... now for the important info:The replacement head is much, much better at panning than the original.  It is as smooth as the Pro model (AVTP) that I also own.  However, the Tilt action did suffer from a "bump" almost right at the level position.  But, I did work the head for about an hour to break it in and the "bump" seems to be gone or at least very minimal.Both the AVTP (Pro) and the AVT models have very good fluid style Heads, especially for the price range.  I will say though, that there seems to be a consistency issue with the Ravelli heads.  I have 2 AVTP tripods plus this AVT model and they each require a different tension setting to get an approximate/same panning & tilt action.  Not a problem, just not consistent.Again, for the price you get a very, very good value.  I would highly recommend either model to anyone looking for a bargin - great bang for you buck![ORIGINAL Review]First, major praise for CheetaMounts for their really, really fast delivery!  WOW! I don't know how they do it, but they get their orders out fast!!!!What's in the box:* Tripod* 2-way fluid head* 2 handles/arms (to attach to the head)* 2 base mounting plates (one already in the head and an extra one)* 1 carrying bag* 1 hex wrenchFit & Finish:* The Head:  It is solid and very heavy, not what I expected at this price.  The only plastic piece is the handle used to adjust the tension for the tilt.  Looks like other "pro" heads and has the same features.  The two included handles attach to the head and can be adjusted for proper angle.* The legs (sticks):  They are a mix of metal, aluminum, and plastic.  The overall construction is metal & aluminum.  The plastic pieces are used in the locking sections to secure the position of bolts in the flip-locks.  (I'm a little concerned that with heavy use, these may not last... but with care, I'm sure I'll get a lot of mileage out of them.)  The feet could have used a bit more design improvement, but they do provide basic function - rubber or spiked, just spin the foot assembly to expose the spike.  There is no locking nut so if you pickup and move the tripod there's a chance a foot will spin out of position, thus requiring a re-leveling.  (I solved this loose-spinning problem w/ some generous amounts of plumbers tape to give the threads some bite to allow the foot assembly to stay in place.)  Speaking of leveling, there's one circle-bubble level at the base of the head.Form & Function:Once all pieces are assembled and the legs are locked off, the stance of the tripod is very solid.  (I only have a Canon HF-S100 w/ all the accessories, so I can't say if it can support heavier rigs...)  The tension of the pan and tilt is very stiff.  On mine, the tilt is very smooth through the whole range.  It is consistent and I'm very pleased with its capabilities.[UPDATE: I've since recieved a replacement from CheetaMounts for the AVT Head.  After a short "break-in" period on the new head to try to get rid of a "bump" that is evident right at the level position, I'm now able to pull very smooth pan action and almost the same level of smoothness in the tilt as the Pro version (AVTP).  I'm not sure why the heads are different between the 2 models - they look the same other than handles & the bubble level, but I suspect the internal mechanism must be different some how.  The problems I describe below for the pan action of the AVT head are no longer present with the replacement.]The pan, however, is not as consistent.  There are times when I get very smooth starts, stops, & continuous pans.  Then there are other times when it feels like a bargain head.  I've tried all the adjustments without much success.  If your constantly moving the head, like following a sport from the sideline, it works great.  However, the moment you stop the head and try to start again, your taking a gamble whether or not you hit a "sticky" point.  This is probably fixable, but I haven't it figured out yet...Summary:For all the features you get, you can't beat the price.  If you are looking for a bargain on pro features and you can live with what you're getting, then this is the tripod for you.  I like mine, I added the Ravelli tripod dolly as well.  The combination is great and makes the tripod even more sturdy yet portable.  I can live with the panning issues especially for the price.  It's a good buy for amateurs!
$SUMMARY.: A great product, but..

$REVIEW.: If you're installing this on Windows, don't use the CD that comes with the drive (it only includes crapware unless you root around in the subdirectories for other fairly useless software) and don't follow the instructions in the manual, none of this helps.  Search for the Western Digital Knowledge Base article, for Windows 7 this is Answer ID 3838:[...] Western Digital Knowledge Base URL deleted by AmazonUsing this method there shouldn't be much difference between installation for XP, Vista and Windows 7.These are good instructions except that they don't mention that you'll see a 200 MB EFI System Partition for the 2 TB and 4 TB versions of this drive, not sure about the 1 TB.  This partition is needed because of the size of the drive and you don't want to muck with this.This drive takes about 10 minutes to format and install on Windows if you follow these instructions.The only reason you might want to install any of the software off the CD is if you want to change from RAID 0 to RAID 1, but if you're using this for backup you'll want to keep the RAID 0 setting.  There are a couple of other bells and whistles on the CD software, like displaying the temperature of the drive and having the LEDs indicate the capacity, stuff I can easily do without.  If you've already installed the Drive Manager and you're having problems try removing it and following the above instructions.I've found that this drive works far better on eSATA than other eSATA drives, so I'm pretty happy with it, and for the first time I'm seeing eSATA hot swap working.  I'm also seeing 100 MB/sec throughput on eSATA compared with 35 to 40 MB throughput on USB and Firewire.My only complaint, and the one star off, is that it is the ugliest flat silver color imaginable, a color that was maybe okay in the 60's.  They should include a can of black spray paint for this!It would have been nice too if they had included an eSATA cable rather than 2 Firewire cables.paul j

 I use them every day

 I had Ultimate ears a couple of years ago but they were okay with very thick wire

 These S4s are sleek and nice, with the same robust sound and thin wires

 I liked the sound of the first pair so much I bought a second pair so I would not need to be without sound

$REVIEW.: I have had my Nikon D40 since Nov of 2007 and I've been snappin away ever since

 This is my first DSLR and I don't see why anyone would need anything more expensive
 I find the pictures are super and the functions are easy to understand and use

The menu is easy and if you don't know how to use or what certain feature in the menu means, you hit the ?/ question button at the bottom of the camera while you are in menu mode and it tells you what you need to know


A built in maual! What a great thing

It's helped me out a lot
 There are so many more great things

One thing I can say that it does not have a live view of your image you are about to shoot but you get used to not having it


 It is super easy to view it afterwards


Going back and forth from a shot phtot to the ready to shoot mode is quick and easy

 Lens swapping is a breeze

 Always keep handy a special lint and scratch or abrasive free cleaning cloth that is designed for lenses so you can keep your lens fingerprint and lint free


Always buy a UV fiter for each lens you buy and pay attention to your lens thread for buying the right filters


 UV filters will protect your lenses from damaging fingerprints and scratches
 Keep caps on when you are not using your camera

 Protection Protection!!!I find this camrea is a great camera for someone who is starting out in the Digital SLR phase of their lives.You will find yourself buying more lenses

 I use a Tarmon 300 mm lens made for the NIkon D40
 [...]Check out the product info
 This lens is inexpensive and works fairly well.THe kit lens 18- 55 mm lens is baisc but the photos are sharp.If it is made by Nikon, its got to be great!Happy Camper!

$review_text.: 7 years later, I'm still using these in my work dependably.  The best part of these mini ball heads is that they're compact, they have good holding capacity, and they also supply a reducer bushing that allows you to use 1/4&#34;-20 and 3/8&#34;-16 mounts.One of these units is attached to the base of a PhotoFlex LiteDome XS with my Canon 580EX and PocketWizard connected to it.  That's a good a mount of weight, but I've had this setup attached to a Manfrotto Super clamp, a Light Stand, and any number of attachment points and it has worked amazingly well give me the angle I need to setup the light.I've also used these with my Pocket Wizard FlexTT5s atop a lightstand to point lights at a wedding.  Works well and never falls over or needs attendance.These are solid ballheads.I even use these in a pinch on my SLIK Sprint Mini tripod with an Arca Swiss compatible platform to hold my 5D Mark II and a small 17-40 lens with no issues.It's been 7 years and these things are going strong!

$review_text.: I had a WD MyBook 1TB under my desk and I never heard it.  This one I wanted to just put behind my monitor.  You know one thing i love about MACS is how quiet they are compared to Windows machines from my experience.  Anyway..Installation was easy. Moved all of my iMovie and iPhoto libraries over and freed up tons of space.But one thing I noticed...it does not run all the time, but when it does..I can hear it...I have sensitive ears especially around the computer..I don't want to make this a negative review because for the price this seems like a good value.  Time will tell about how reliable it is.  I suppose if the noise starts to bother me I will mount under the desk on a wall shelf.  I guess the only reason it bothers me is because before my mac was silent.This things need a sound noise rating like bathroom fans(sones)...their you can compare how loud the fans are.Upate: 10/11/13 Ok.  Now that I have had this thing up and running for 3 days...I want to update that it is loud when it starts up  but it does not run all the time. Only when u access a file on it, or are browsing thru finder.  Otherwise it lays dormant, which for me if perfectly ok at this point.  Makes sense. I can live with it.  They all work that way i assume.

$REVIEW.: This is not a very good case.  I bought if for the SD1200.  It's the right width, but it's about 1/4" taller than the camera so extra wasted space makes it bulkier than it should be (and it's already bulky).  But that's not the real problem.  The real problem is that the hole is too small to be used with Canon's shoulder-strap.  You can cram it through there sure (with a lot of work), but that defeats the whole idea of making it easy to use.  Also, the magnet on the closure seems very weak (why not use a strong magnet?!).  I can't imagine that would hold up for any length of time.I waited a little too late to return mine, but I'll just get rid of it.  I'm using an older case (the one I had with an SD800) -- it doesn't really fit right (too wide) but at least I can get the shoulder strap in and out easily.  And the Velcro is very secure (if noisier than a magnet).So I would not recommend this case for an SD1200.  Other reviewers have said it doesn't work for an SD1100.  Not really sure what it DOES work for.  But even if it fit, the magnet and hole-size are real quality problems.  Don't buy it.

$review_text.: Although I have only owned the Harmony Remote for a very short time and cannot vouch for its longevity, I feel that the great first impression that it produced needed to be shared.With the proliferation of AV equipment and all of the confusing remote control options, it has become a nightmare to turn on and operate 3 or even 2 devices at one time.  Well not any more.  Now with this wonderful intelligent Harmony remote, you are in control.  The Harmony can control every device you have and it can do it intelligently.  It knows and remembers what you have turned on and adapts itself to controlling only the primary functions necessary for the activity that you are presently doing, thereby minimizing the buttons positions that you will need to learn and remember.  Watch a DVD and the forward and rewind buttons control the DVD while the volume and mute buttons control your AV receiver.  Watch a VHS Tape and the forward and rewind buttons automatically control the VCR.  No more having to tell the remote which device you want to control, it knows...  This is the first multi unit remote that is not frustrating to use.  It is simple, intuitive, and yet very customizable as well.  Programming is done with the computer in less than two hours.  It is so simple that the manual has very little in the way of instructions.  Moreover, if you do run into trouble, the toll free tech support is the best I have come across in a very long time.  The wait is less than 5 minutes during peak hours and the people on the other end are very knowledgeable and speak English (they are located in Canada). >&lt;> Here is why I give the setup procedure a 4 out of 5. The reason is that I did have to call tech support.  They told me I needed to download and run a firmware update before my remote would communicate with the PC properly.  However, with the technicians guidance it was a simple process.  It would be an improvement if the manual that came with the unit had a little more set-up information and screen shots so that one can follow along to see if everything is proceeding normally. Additionally, it would help if the LCD screen on the remote would give some indication when it is communicating with the PC.  It would have cut my setup time in half or down to one hour.

And, yes, processing time is a bit slow, particularly when you want to run things like Word on it. I doubled the RAM, that helped. And I liked how light-weight, portable, and easy to use it is.However, the real disappointment is that about a year and a half after I bought it, the battery would no longer charge fully. It would go up to 30% and then stop charging, which means that the computing time went down dramatically from about 6-7 hours to less than 2 hours. I talked to someone at customer service, they basically said it was my problem because it happened after the 1-year warranty. So I bought a replacement battery. I even upgraded a bit, from 6000mAh to 7200mAh. Same thing: The battery does not charge properly. A talk with customer service had no tangible result. While they were friendly, they were unable to tell if this is a power management issue, or whatever else. Obviously, I don't want to put more money into this machine. The battery is expensive, and so is diagnostic and repair work. Planned obsolescence?!Update November 2010: I have tried new batteries, but the same thing is happening, so it's really a problem of the power management, not of the batteries. This basically made a great machine unusable. I stopped using this device, although I initially really liked it.

I love Roku because it lets me watch Nerflix, Amazon Prime movies and lots of other channels on my TV instead of my laptop


Of course if you're used to regular TV where you don't have to choose the program you want to watch, then Roku is not for you


But as a one time investment of $60, it does provide very good entertainment.Installation was simple and the Roku site has the channel list (they do have a significantly large number of them)
But I miss You tube!!I like their remote has dedicated buttons for Pandora and Netflix


So far, it's worked great.

$REVIEW.: I really like this iPad 2 cover.  The leather is really nice. When it's closed it looks like a bound book. It's not bulky at all. It's a pretty dark brown. I would have liked the corners to be a little thicker for better protection (since the corners need to be exposed to access the device.) You can't beat the price of this one either. So far so good! It would be nice if it had a stylus holder on the bottom.

$review_text.: I was really excited about the potential of this camera; the picture quality was outstanding, the ergonomics were perfect, I have some really good glass for it, but there was a recurring problem with the files that I downloaded to Lightroom, both in DNG and in Pentax mode.  There was always a black band along the right side.  I called Pentax and the tech said I had to use Pentax software, which I could have used and then exported to Lightroom.  I just don't think I should have to go that extra step.  I don't have to do it with my K100D, so what is going on?  Anyway, I have tried 2 different K20 cameras and they both did the same thing.  I haven't been able to find any reference to this problem on the Pentax forum, or any other reveiw of the K20.  I hope someone can figure this out so I can resume my K20 habit.

$REVIEW.: Purchased this product because all ear bud types I have tried do not seem to fit my ears, and do not provide sufficient noise isolation in noisy environments (automobile with passengers, airplanes, Etc.)Frankly, the HANC80's are marginal performers at best.  Most of their noise isolation (approximately 2 - 3 dB) is realized from their over the ear design.  The active noise cancelling function may gain an additional 1 dB of reduction independent of mode selection. Audio reproduction is on par or slightly better than with other inexpensive earphones/buds.

$REVIEW.: Fit right into my SD-only camcorder and it's got tons of room for more videos. Plus, this was the best deal I found online. So it's cheap and has a large capacity.Unfortunately, I think the card is to blame for taking a decent HD video I took and making it choppy and jumpy. I'm not sure whether it was the card or not, but being that the video played back great on the camera and the card was the only link between the camera and the computer, I'm going to assume it was the card.

$REVIEW.: I recently moved to a large city and have found the Nuvi to be indispensable and a great stress reliever when trying to find a restaurant, store, office, etc., especially during heavy traffic.This is my first GPS, although I've used a StreetPilot before with rental cars

 The Nuvi is much lighter and has a brighter screen than the StreetPilot's I've used.The vast majority of addresses and locations I've tried to find are in the database and the Nuvi gives great directions and routing information


 On only a couple of occasions has it been unable to find a location


 Also, on occasion it has trouble navigating some of the insanely designed, spaghetti bowl freeway interchanges and ramps in the city, but for the most part, gets them right

 The only other issue is if the store or office you are looking for is in a large shopping center, it will take you to the shopping center entrance then it's up to you to find your destination from there.Those were minor inconveniences compared to some of the successful navigations

Once, I drove to a remote recreational spot and had to make a 25 mile detour on winding backroads through the Texas Hill Country due to the main road being flooded out and the Nuvi guided me unerringly to my destination
Good boy!I haven't used the bluetooth or MP3 features and probably never will.Sometimes, I take the Nuvi with me on hikes
 It's not a cross country navigator but it will show your location relative to any local road network
 Just be sure to mute it so the Nuvi doesn't announce directions from your pocket.Finally, I travel on business from time to time and I anticipate that I'll be bringing the Nuvi with me the next time I go to a city with which I'm unfamiliar


 The same goes with vacations, of course.Overall, I rate my purchase of the Nuvi as one of my best investments ever

 It works wonderfully well for the most part and has met my expectations.

$REVIEW.: I have owned this camera for several years now and I decided to write a review after the camera finally died.Within the first week, I experienced the lens error/gear grinding that many other reviewers have written about.  I sent the camera back for service and it was taken care of under warranty, but it was a little inconvenient to be without my brand new camera for a while.The second camera worked great for a while, but eventually it tried to turn on in a pocket and I had the lens/gear grinding issue again.  After turning it on and off a few times, the camera seemed to sort itself out.  I bought a small case for it, mainly to keep it from turning on when not in use and damaging the extending lens.  One day I thinking about what a poor design it was and decided to poke around the menus.  I found the option that allows you to 'deactivate' the power on button on the back that accidentally gets pushed and causes everyone problems!  It allows you to designate the tiny, recessed power button on the top as the only way to turn it on.  This button has never been accidentally pressed and I had no issues with the camera after that adjustment.  It would have been nice to come with that as the default setting from the factory.  It sounds like it would have saved many people from breaking their lenses.I have always been very satisfied with the quality of the photos and virtually any dificult lighting situation has been overcome with some minor adjustments on the menu or the simple use of the flash.  This camera's tiny size has made it the perfect party companion and I have countless pictures from bars and clubs that would not have been taken if I had to carry a bulkier camera around.  The convenience and tiny size alone has made this camera worth every penny.  It starts up quickly and is ready to take a picture as soon as you are.  The focus doesn't hunt around and the time between shots is short enough that I don't notice it.Sadly, my girlfriend dropped the camera on the floor in Vegas and I got the lens error message again.  It won't focus now and makes funny clicking noises.  I don't abuse my things, but I didn't treat this camera as carefully as an egg either.  I'm not sure how its durability measures up against other cameras, but I'm disappointed with the durability of the extending lens mechanism.  This camera has been with me during many wonderful memories and I would buy another one if Casio resolved the lens issue.
$SUMMARY.: Lens mechanism is fragile, but quick startup and great pictures

$REVIEW.: There are tons of covers out there, and although I did choose a less expensive cover for my Paperwhite, I am glad my 8 year old daughter has this genuine kindle cover for her Kindle Fire.  It fits perfectly.  It went on easily, but never felt loose.  Everything plugs in easily.  The color is very pretty and vibrant.  The cover has a texture that keeps it from slipping out of her hands.  It's thin and not bulky.  It puts the kindle to sleep when she closes it, and awakens when she opens it.  It props open like a stand.  It's just all around awesome.  There is nothing not to like about it.  Well worth the money.

$review_text.: Replacing the Original Tab.  This was the best move I made.The form and size is less bulky and more ergonomic than the Tab.  It is easy to hold the weight is good for long periods of reading unlike any 10" tablet I have owned or used.  Transporting in a suit or back pocket is a plus.Speed and UI is snappy for a single core processor.  Which is a disappointment since the predecessor had a dual core but, to keep the cost low it is a sacrifice I can easily live with.Battery Life is the best of any computing device I have ever owned I don't have to worry about charging it all the time nor worry about not having enough battery for daily use.Storage Capacity and SD Slot.  While is was also disappointing in having only 8GB's of storage when the predecessors offering 16 & 32 GB's,  The ability to add up to 64 GB's cards and easy integration of cards make this not really noticeable at all.  No matter what case you may put this in accessing the SD slot is arduous task to say the least.Screen. Is bright but not as vivid as other tablets but for the price it is pretty darn good.  The screen is great for watching media but not the best for reading periodicals.  If you are in to reading books, manuals, & periodicals I would recommend a 4:3 ratio screen or a 10" tablet or I hate to say an iXxx device.  Not wanting to have a iXxx device or a hand heavy 10" tablet is a sacrifice I am willing to make.The Tab 2 is a great value and should be relevant in years to come.  I don't see it becoming so out dated any time soon.

It's super simple, just slide the Kindle in and it's well protected and padded.I might have bought a different item if I'd thought about the fact that there's no way to attach the Kindle to a USB cord while it's in the sleeve. Also--I have only used my Kindle at home so far so I can just keep the sleeve on the table by my chair. It's occurred to me that when I take it elsewhere to use it, I'd prefer to have a notebook format that holds the Kindle while I'm reading it so there's no problem with misplacing the sleeve.So, overall a very well-designed product, but keep the limitations in mind.

$REVIEW.: These earbuds have a good fit owing to variable sizes of silicone inserts (3 sizes). They look stylish and are not very obtrusive when you're wearing them. Sound quality is decent, but it seemed like there was limited bass response compared to a pair ofSennheiser MX55 Twist-To-Fit In-Ear Stereo Headphonesthat I have owned for a while. However, the noise-canceling qualities of these earbuds more than make up for this lack of bass response. Another drawback is the fact that you have to buy a carrying case for these; for this much money, the manufacturer should have at least thrown in a cheap container (I'm using an old Altoids tin).As far as the packaging, I was disappointed to find the earbuds not only inside of a thick plastic bubble pack (welded around the edge so that you need scissors to cut it open), but that packaging was inside of a cardboard box!Since this is a review about the product and not about it's packaging, my star rating is solely based on my comments about the earbuds. Taken separately, I rate the packaging with one (ungreen) star.

$REVIEW.: MPro 150 is the coolest mobile projector I have seen on the market.  I bought this unit when it first came out for its versatile functions and its quality design. I have played movies, presentation files, photos with it and they all work great.  I can't believe it runs like a handheld computer with such a small form factor.  With it I can project a movie to 50inch size in the dark and that is a good quality movie I can enjoy.  The internal memory is really useful so I can see goodbye to cables on the go.  Unlike some other units I have tried, the projector stay cool during the entire operation.  And the color is accurate.  I love it!

$REVIEW.: I had always heard that Apple batteries need to be replaced by technicians, but after seeing how it's done on YouTube I decided to spend the few dollars this kit costs and try to replace the battery on my Fourth Generation (I.e., ancient) iPod.  It's not simple, but if you carefully follow the instructions you can do it.The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the plastic tools that come with it are barely adequate for the job.  I doubt, though, that any kind of plastic tool would work well since it takes a considerable amount of force to open the iPod case, and plastics are either too brittle or too soft. There may be special metal tools available for people who do this all the time, but you can use these plastic tools to get started and then see if you need to use something else to finish the job.  Long story short, it worked!  And the battery seems to be holding a charge well.
$SUMMARY.: It Worked!

$review_text.: I got this product about April '08. I'm quite pleased with it. Most reviews rate it higher than the MB-D80 from Nikon. I get two batteries in the camera, while the third charges. The lock ring tightens very well on mine (read about others having problems) if you put a little umph on it.The AA battery insert is a nice feature for emergencies. The shutter button on it is not quite as smooth as that on the camera. I'd like to see that improved. I get the sub-command dial and the command dial in the vertical position. It also has a power switch for the grip, to save a little bit of juice when not in use.The feel is well built and sturdy. It is lighter than I expected, but not cheap feeling at all. The rubber grip appears to be well made and has stood up well to many long hours of sun, heat, and sweat. I have a sure grip even with the sweatiest hands. The ability to have a second battery is easily worth the price of the unit. The only thing missing is a second card slot!The instructions aren't the best, but what's to know. Plug in, turn on. Not quite as sturdy feeling as my old Canon grip, but tougher than it seems at first and well made. The shutter button could use a little work, though.Four Stars!

$review_text.: For the price paid, I would recommend this handheld to any ham operator. I did purchase a Comet SMA 24J antenna (from an Amazon vendor) and I can access several local 2 meter/70 cm repeaters from my location. The included antenna is marginal at best unless you live quite close to a repeater or you are on the upper floor and next to a window of your condo. Build quality is excellent and audio reports likewise. Although it would be your choice to purchase the programming cable/software for this radio, for this unit and two other BAOFengs I own, manual programming presented no problems. WP4AOH's website has an excellent guide with photos and programming examples that make the task straightforward. Although the package arrived in good condition, the vendor could have used sturdier outside packaging. (boxed with padding as opposed to a tyvek envelope). (Shipping time was only 2 days.)

$REVIEW.: One of the USB ports on the back of the unit is "bad", the power fluctuates to it constantly messing up the status of any attached device (I tried a Playstation Eye and a Free Agent portable hard drive).  Otherwise the rest of the unit seems to function well enough.  I'm not going to complain since the unit was less than $10 and I only intended it as a stop-gap solution.

$REVIEW.: When I first got it, I didn't think it was fake
 It looked really nice and worked like a charm- for a day

 On day two, the "Charging is not supported with this accessory" appeared


 I unplugged and plugged it back in
 Still no go

 I had no choice but to take it off and return it


 Upon visiting mophie.com, I realized that even Amazon is not an authorized dealer, not to mention "Fulfill by Amazon"


 Buy this from your wireless carrier

 From Bestbuy
 Even from Gamestop!  You will sleep much better knowing you get a real one with a year warrantee.EDIT: Now I have had this case for 2 weeks now, I can say...1
I ordered it when it said it was sold by Fireball

 When it was shipped, it said it was from MobileCityOnline, which was an authorized dealer
 After comparing it to another one from the Verizon store under a magnified glass, it was real.2


Even the Verizon store one gave me the "Charging is not supported with this accessory"

 As it turned out, if your phone got charged way ahead of the battery case, this message will show up
 Not every time but very likely
 If you just leave it alone, it will still charge both regardless.3
It still won't sync with your iTunes with the case on.4

I decided to keep it and returned the one I got from Verizon for comparison.

$REVIEW.: I have had just about every digital camera you can mention - but this is the first review I've written

I really wanted to like (actually love) this camera - could not wait to get it! Wow - I.S., 8MP, Leica lens - what else could you want! Well - I also bought a Canon SD700 a few weeks ago too (both cameras still within return dates) so I put them to the test


Bottom line - the Canon won hands down! By the way, I also have a Sony P200 - the Canon is still much better

Back to the Panasonic review - pictures were OK - actually not bad, nothing really special - the 16:9 is nice but the pictures appear smaller so you need to zoom in a bit


However the Canon was just as good even at only 6 MP! I use the video option a lot and don't even bother with my old Video Camera anymore


Over the last two week I went to two weddings and produced very nice little videos for the couples only using the Canon SD700 (no shakes to make people sea sick)
Clear and sharp video with that little SD700 (you can even zoom in although it gets pixilated a bit)


Unfortunately, the Panasonic is pretty very bad at video, no zooming, blurry, and jumpy - and you also must use .mov format to view vs
the more common .avi for the Canon

On the outside - the Panasonic is larger than the Canon and the lens sticks out and use an old fashioned lens cap - now that would be acceptable if the other functions of the camera we good
All in all - I've returned the Panasonic and will keep the Canon - just one man's (I mean person's) opinion!



$SUMMARY.: So So! Very bad video! Sorry Panasonic!

$REVIEW.: I've had it for about a week and I have slowly grown in love with it. Within minutes of opening it on Christmas morning, I was able to control my TV, my surround sound, VCR and even my obscure AvelLink IODATA network connected DVD player. The macro/activities are great for the non techies in your house. Things really do work right out of the box, but be prepared to spend some extra time customizing the controls to make things easier for them.For example, some devices have quite a few control options so the remote requires several menu screens to display them. Some of the most rareley used options are placed on the first screens by default. This is not a show stopper, but you must spend some time on your computer to reprogram it.  (the Logitech programming software is a breeze to use by the way)The only negative thing I have to complain about is the low screen resolution. It looks fine for the controls, but the software lets you add images for backgrounds. By the time you add a photo, it is so pixelated, it is unrecognizable. I didn't buy the remote for this feature, so it is not a big deal, but I'm not really sure why they even include this option since it is so unusable.The other thing I have to complain about (if anyone at Logitech is listening)is the limited number of commands that you can add to a prerecorded "sequence." The remote allows you to create a custom config macro of up to five commands. My TV requires nine button clicks to turn closed captioning on and off. I was hoping to be able to create a macro with the remote, but since it can only take five sequential commands, I can not do it. Again, not a show stopper, but I hope they can increase this in future upgrades.If I had it to do all over again, I would definitely by this remote again.

What makes the Belkin Dual Fit Armband for Ipod Classic unique? Nothing really.It seems well made and the neoprene makes it comfortable enough.The insert is large and there is a small opening at the bottom for your headphone jack.This product is designed for one version of the Ipod and while other, smaller versions will fit, they seem a little lost in the sleeve.The fit on my arm did seem a little awkward

It felt like I had to pull it tight, much like a blood pressure monitor cuff and I am not sure that is the best thing in the world when you are trying to excercise

$review_text.: 4 Stars because it does everything it was designed to do, but could simply have been made better. The spin feature is a thing of beauty, it spins easily to desired position and back. What would improve the case would be another port opening in the case to charge tablet while case is closed in most likely and useful tablet position while open. Another improvement might include a slightly larger lip on three position triangulation which holds tablet base in place. I would also prefer a Velcro closure flap that could also keep top cover pinned to the back cover so that the assembly could be held in one hand while using the tablet while standing or in motion.

$REVIEW.: The picture quality is stunning. 1080p looks pin sharp and even SD DVDs look just a whisker away from HD quality, if you have a decent DVD Upscaler like the Oppo 981-HD. The tuner is better than my Comcast Motorola DVR!! I directly connected the cable into the TV and the picture quality is amazing compared to the DVR supplied by Comcast. I have also played PC games, notably Battlefield 2142 and Oblivion. Both look great, even if you stretch the output to a 16:9 aspect. Oblivion can be set to run at 1080 if you have the right graphics card features on your PC. I sometimes use the TV to Skype my Mom back in Britain. It's cool speaking to her through the TV screen ;-)There are plenty of settings and connections for other equipment, such as consoles. I plan to get the new PS3 soon which has a 1080p resolution. It's going to be awesome on this Samsung. The only microscopic niggles that I have is I wish they would supply a few screen shrinking modes, as some cable channels, correctly rendered in their 4:3 ratio to fill the screen, would look better if they could be shrunk to hide the cable compression artefacts. This isn't the TV's fault. If the cable transmission is good, the picture quality will blow you away. I also had a few fuzzy blotches on the screen that have been gradually fading. I have read that others have had this and the blotches almost disappear after a month or two of use. You can't see them unless the transmission includes a dark background, then you might just spot a slight hazy spot. It hasn't been bad enough for me to go to 4 stars, because the spec of this TV and price is so good!!

$REVIEW.: Others have covered the pros and cons of this device pretty well. I just thought I would mention that I use it in my car with no external antenna and it works great, with very little to no loss of reception.  I live in South Florida, which might have something to do with it....I'm not sure.Be aware that if you put it in the docking station, the internal antenna cuts off, so you must use an external antenna with it docked.I mounted it in a cup holder device with a mount made to hold a cell phone (shop around, you can find these for about $10).  I only have a wire going out from the headphone connection to my radio, which has an external jack for a peripheral device, and a wire to the cigarette lighter plug for power.  I really don't even need the power connection if I prefer to just keep it charged and home and move it back and forth, which means I only really need the one wire to the radio for it to work, should I prefer to set it up that way.  By the way, if you have a car charger for a Roady device, it should work fine with the Inno with their included adapter (mine did).My only really complaint is that the remote that comes with it has really stiff buttons, so changing the channels, etc with it takes some getting used to, meaning that simple tasks via the remote are more work than they ought to be.  Also, switching to the favorite channel listings that you have created is sort of a pain....you have to click the right arrow key, then move up or down, then click select, then if nothing is on that channel you want to listen to, back you go again through the same process.  I wish there was a simpler way to do this (there may be, perhaps I just don't know about it).The record feature is particular handy to have...if you are listening to a song on the XM that you like, just hit the record button and it records it from the beginning, even if you push record halfway through the song.  You do, of course, have to have it on that particular channel from the song's beginning. When nothing good is on (yes, even with all their channels quite often XM comes up short on anything worth listening too) you can switch over to your recorded songs.Anyway, I've been very pleased with it thus far and I do recommend it.

$review_text.: The primary appeals of the ZiiSound D3x system are two: First, it's Bluetooth-based, so I can put it in different parts of the house and set playlists from my PC or phone to play without having to move those items around. Second, its modular system allows me to add components either to get a stereo or left-right-center array or simply to channel the same audio signal to multiple receivers in multiple rooms, both of which offer great convenience and great performance.The speakerbox is solidly-built and of good quality. The physical profile is a little unusual- wider than most speakers for this kind of application, but that's because each box actually houses two speakers, which can be set up to deliver stereo output. This means I don't actually need multiple modules to get stereo output (though, as with any speaker-system where the left and right outputs are co-located, the stereo effect isn't as prominent as it would be with multiple speakers). I am, however, looking forward to testing these with multiple units so that I can set up a stereo array to my liking.Pairing with my devices was quick and painless, as it should be with Bluetooth-enabled gear.The sound is fine. One thing users should be aware of with any new consumer speaker system is that the speakers are 'colored', which means they have a distinctive sound that may require EQ adjustment at the play-source. Specifically, the D3x speakers are somewhat bass-heavy, so I created a specific sound profile for my phone's media player (and another for my PC's) to offset this a bit. Once I found a 'sweet spot', it was all good. Volume is good; they won't blow any windows out, of course, but for use around my house, they're more than sufficient, and when used in pairs or groups, the system will be that much louder.In addition to the speakers, Creative also makes a sub-box (the Creative ZiiSound DSx Wireless Subwoofer for ZiiSound Modular Speaker Systems (51MF8125AA000)), which I'm interested in trying. As I remarked, the D3x is a little heavy on the bass right out of the box, so my guess is that a perfect sound profile will be one that pulls most of the mid-lows out of the EQ and leaves them to the subwoofer, or else one that is set up to send different values to multiple speakers. In any case, I'm sure it's a formidable combination.In summary, this is a great buy for someone looking to pipe audio wirelessly to different places, and the modular system ensures easy expansion at the buyer's own pace. Recommended!
$review_summary.: A great speaker and a fantastic modular system

$REVIEW.: Motorola MotoACTV wrist strapI used this wrist strap for running several times and did not encounter any problems. I also have a Garmin Forerunner 305 and the strap on the 305 started to crack at one part where the buckle is found but it did not impair the functionality of the strap. On the MotoACTV, the wrist strap has two buckles  to split the load. There's also a metal plate with 2 studs that helps retain the free part of the strap. Others complained about it coming out, but if you look closely it is designed to do that. There's nothing permanent about how it clips onto the strap. Overall it is a very sturdy design based on a polymer resin material and metal buckles. I don't have any issues with the strap and I found that this is the best and easiest way to use the MotoACTV.Overall: 5/5 stars
$SUMMARY.: Best way to use the MotoACTV

$REVIEW.: My go to headphones are Sennheiser HD 595s for when I'm by the computer and Westone UM2s for working out and traveling.  While the Sony MDRX8600 are on-ear the former are over-the-ear and in-ear.  Both the 595s and UM2s are recommended; after countless hours of listening to music and audio in general, they have proven their worth.  But I was looking for something new to experiment with and was happy to try out these Sony headphones.  I devoted about half the day to listening to music and watching movies/shows and have to say that I did not come away impressed.  First off, aesthetically, the pictures on amazon are not representative of the actual headphones, which are much more muted and bland compared to the advertising shots you'll see.  Size wise, they aren't too big, although I was not comfortable with their fit.  They seemed big for my head in their smallest/tightest position, while the 595s I have to actually adjust to my head's size.  Furthermore, after several hours of using these headphones, with minor breaks, my ears began to noticeably suffer from the pressure of the headphones and I had to switch to the Sennheisers which have never given me such a problem.  Sound quality wise, there is no comparison with the 595s (unfortunately they are no longer available so for those interested, go for the new 598s).  But that's not a fair comparison as the Sennheiser headphones cost twice as much.  If I had to run errands or needed to use a pair of headphones for an hour or less, these would be fine, but why set such limits on a 100 dollar pair of headphones?  Personally, I don't think they're worth it and I'd recommend investing in something else at this price point.

$review_text.: I purchased this Blu-ray player for its ability to connect to the Internet and the fact it has a 250GB hard drive. I also purchased an Apple Air Port Extreme wireless router. For best performance I relocated my cable modem to the top of our entertainment armoire and placed new wireless router next to it. This configuration let me hardwire the Blu-ray player to the wireless router with a network cable, which is recommended by LG for streaming video over the Internet. Setting up a streaming account with Netflix was easy. We only signed up for the streaming service. I also set up my Google Picasa web albums and YouTube account. It all works well and set up was relatively easy. The wireless portion of the player works but you have to make a choice between wired or wireless. It will not do both simultaneously. I went wired because of Netflix.Since the iMac doesn't have DLNA support native, I will have to find a third-party application to integrate my Mac into the entertainment system. Currently the Blu-ray player simply accesses the internet through a wired connection to the router.The 250GB hard drive works well. I had some MPEG4, AVI and other video files stored on my computer and was able to put them on a flash drive and install them on the Blu-ray player via the USB port on the front. I moved some music files to the hard drive, but the GUI and file structure of the HD makes it a time consuming and tedious process to organize them. I don't think I will move all my music there.Overall, I am very happy with the purchase. It doesn't have 3D, which is why the price dropped drastically since last year, but until all the 3D standards get sorted out, I have no interest in it.
$review_summary.: LG BD590 a very good value

You should research this before purchasing.  (wikipedia.org has a good overview.)  I had to subsequently order and wait for the PCI-Express 1x Firewire 800 card to come in before I could use the reader.PS: It draws all of it's power through the Firewire interface and does not use any external power source.

$review_text.: I absolutely love this speaker.  Someone gave my musician husband one as a gift about 6 months ago.  Since he already had a JAWBONE speaker, he said that I could have (borrow) it.  I plugged it into my mp3 player to listen to in the bathroom and boy was I amazed.  The sound is incredibly awesome!  Well, low and behold I noticed it was missing one day.  I checked with my dear hubby and no doubt, he borrowed (took) it back.  After that I set out on a quest to get my own.  Hello Amazon!!!  I even got it in a girly color (his is blue).  For the time being I have it at work, but I may have to buy another one to have at home.  The sound, durability, and battery life is awesome!  I highly recommend this to anyone who needs a portable rechargeable speaker.

$review_text.: I had just purchased a Samsung TV LN46B650 which uses an ethernet connection to handle firmware updates, as well as streaming of video, pictures and music.  Since the TV is in a bedroom on the far end of my house; I decided to avoid the wireless adapter and try the Linksys PLK300 Powerline Adapters.  I haven't tried video streaming; but everything else has worked well.  There are other vendors of these types of adapters which may work for you; but these worked the first time.  I did not use the encryption feature, which I see as most beneficial to apartment or condo residents who may share wiring.  I have connected my Tivo to the adapter and it has also worked fine. My home is less than 10 years old; so I did not have the complicated wiring or rewiring that people with older homes might deal with.

I decided to take it a step further by going wireless. The wireless version is just a notch below the wired mouse, the scroll feels a bit stickier and less robust but that is the only difference and a small one at that, so far anyway.

$review_text.: A friend and I compared a lot of screen protectors for our phones that we've both gone through and we've pretty much decided for the clear type Tech Armor is the best.  It is cut just a bit smaller than the actual screen size and that's a good thing, because it allows a slight margin of error when you apply the protector, but just enough that hardly any bare screen is showing or is hardly noticeable.  Also the adhesive is really good, it sticky enough to stick and stay but doesn't attract a lot of lint before laying it on, and it doesn't leave any residue, it's also really easy to use the tape to remove any stray lint.  The included cleaning cloth is better too because it doesn't leave a lot lint, some cloths that we had actually left more lint than it removed.  I bough this for my family's new ipad air and it went on perfect the first time (though I had a lot of practice putting on screen savers for all my phones, wife's, parents, etc.)  I had to remove lint/dust from two places and used the tape and came off fine.  The screen works just like normal, very responsive and it's perfectly clear.  My wife probably doesn't even know I put a protector on it.

FrontRow works very well in the media center role, though it needs a few more features to work even better (e.g. be able to show movies within the photos section instead of a blank screen(!), be able to rent movies thru front row, be able to turn on the visualizer when playing music, be able to pick songs (or a playlist) for slide shows).In the server role, all you need do is autolaunch iTunes and iPhoto, and configure them to share your library, and then other computers (or devices) can tap into your media files.

Sometime it works then it doesn't. So I decided to open it up and I found a lint ball inside the casing on top of the circuit board. It was shorting out the board. I removed the lint ball and from that time till today 12/11/12 it still is working.I have about 8" clearance between the staircase and the front end of my truck and 6" between the rear end of my truck and the garage door. It works perfectly. The green light shines as I approach the sensor then the blinking red light as I get closer and a solid red light as I get real close to the sensor/staircase which is about 8".

$REVIEW.: The Uspeed Dual Band router is a very nice device for the price.Unboxing:This part was easy. Open the cardboard flap and just pull the router, the power supply and network cable. Done. Very simple.Configuration-As I've experienced with other Uspeed devices, the manual isn't the greatest because it doesn't seem to have been written by an English speaking native.The configuration works like this:1) Plug in the power to the router2) Take the network cable coming from your cable/DSL/fiber modem and plug it into the blue WLAN port on the Uspeed3) Plug the cable that came with the Uspeed into your laptop/desktop computer4) Connect to the router's configuration page by opening your Internet browser of choice and go to: 192.168.0.15) Click the Wizard tab on the left side of the screen6) Choose Gateway (unless you need a different setup - Bridge is if you already have a wireless network and are trying to extend it and Wireless ISP -> I'm not sure what that one does for you)7) Leave the Lan settings alone (you can change the IP range on your router from 192.168.0.x to anything you would like - though I recommend sticking to the 192.x.x.x range)8) Wireless Band setting - set your SSID (your wireless network name), choose the Network Mode (I recommend mixed 2.4 and 5 as this gives you the most convenient options)9) Wireless Security -> Configure either WPA or WPA2. Do not leave your network open. Either could potentially be cracked, but at least you would have some protection.Disconnect the wire. Enable your wireless connection and connect to the new wireless connection. If you have N capability on your device, I highly recommend you use the SSID (5G) option as this will give you the faster network speeds.Quality-Overall, the Uspeed router seems to be good quality and is easy to setup. I haven't had any connection issues at all and the range covers the house easily. And it covers a little outside as well, so we can sit on the deck and browse the Internet.For the price, this is easily one of the least expensive N routes available. It also does a great job of providing connectivity when and where needed.The only complaint I have is the non-native English language manual might make this a little confusing to configure out of the box. They do offer free technical support, so you should be able to call them for help if it isn't something you can easily figure out on your own.Disclaimer - I received a free review device from USpeed. This has, in no way, changed the content of this review.

$review_text.: I don't understand what some of the bad reviews are all about.  This radio with HD has very nice audio and I'm comparing this to a Sony Xplode that it replaced which lasted a year and then developed problems.Installation was simple.  To trick it into playing DVD's just get a PAC TR7 from Amazon and it will trigger the parking brake wire everytime you start ignition.  Problem solved if you want to play DVD's when the car is moving for passengers.The sound quality blows the old sony away. It's clear. not to tinny, not to bass or deep it sounds real nice with awesome surround output.The only 2 downsides to the player is the response time is slower than usual and when you play an MP3 and reach the last track it doesn't automatically go back to the first track again.Other than those 2 minor annoyances this player is awesome for the money!You get a whole lot more than what you paid and it's good quality right out of the box.I have no complaints for what I paid whatsoever and glad I bought this unit.  And I buy almost everything from Amazon.com they have great customer service and a simple return policy if your not happy.GET ONE BEFORE THEY ARE GONE!

$review_text.: I am a long time Tivo customer and have continuously been impressed with how well their device and service work
 My problem is with the cost of their subscription model


 Whether you pay month by month or for a "lifetime" plan, the service is very expensive for what you get
 In my opinion, they could make up for lower prices with the increased volume of sales they would get if their subscription prices weren't so high.As for a review of the box and hardware, I am very happy with it

 The picture looks great, and the interface and remote are extremely intuitive.I highly recommend this product, as long as the subscription price is worth it to you.

I do a fair amount of traveling and this filter has saved many photos. (and cut down on post time in photo shop) I can't always keep to the dawn/dusk timelines when I'm with vacationing with family.

$review_text.: I love this computer. It is kind of funny to call it that though because of how small it is. But that's not a bad thing especially since it comes with a mount and screws to put on the back of a monitor or maybe even a wall. It runs very fast and is dead silent. Also it stays very cool even after being on for hours. Another thing I should add is that since this is Chrome OS I wasn't too sure if I had to get a keyboard and mouse specific for it. But every keyboard and mouse I got for it works perfectly fine ( I mainly use the Logitech K400 ) Another thing is that this computer is not meant for games or for those who want to use this for editing videos, pictures, or anything like that for business. Also you won't even be able to play any games other than browser based games ( Although Need For Speed Worlds is in the app store which I thought was a downloaded game, but I'm not sure since I didn't try to get it ) But if you just want to use this computer for surfing the web, a media player, or for projects ( This doesn't have the well known Microsoft tools but it does have Google Docs which is exactly the same but I'd say a little better with how it saves ) All around it's a good product and I'd recommend.

$REVIEW.: I chose this over the Quickpod due to comments related to the camera rolling over with the Quickpod extender.The packaging is a little cheap.  Takes a bit of an effort to extend which is ok.  I just hope it doesn't loosen over time to where it starts to slide shut.  The telescopic shaft is notched to avoid the camera from rolling over on it side which I thought was a nice touch.  It is sturdy when held in the hand.  The plastic parts on the extender looked a little cheap and the finishing on them wasn't that great.  But they do the job.  It is light and very compact when closed.  It also has a lanyard.Taking pictures is much better than the good old extending the arm method.  But you do have to get the tilt right otherwise you'll be taking shots a little high or low.  But with practice I am sure the shots will improve.Overall, a very decent product that will put itself to good use.

$review_text.: This High Capacity laptop battery for my particular Toshiba fit fine...BUT! my laptop did not and could not recognize the battery. Thus it would not charge when connected to power...and according to my lapiop nothing was connected. Nor could my computer tell how much or less power is left when not connected to power. I returned the battery and another was sent...I'm not sure the one that was sent was the same battery or a new one, because I had the exact same problem all over again. I eventually returned the battery for a refund, minus S&H; ofcourse.I called Toshiba and recieved a battery that worked immediately. And it also was an off brand 6 cell that last me about 2 hours, using the Balanced power setting. In comparing the oringinal battery (old) to the new off brand from Toshiba...with battery from Brainy Deal...the contacts or copper conductors were only different on the Brainy Deal product.

$REVIEW.: I am very impressed by this storage box for a couple reasons.1. Great sleek & modern style - The metal buttons and corner accents really make it pop with style. And the leather laminate looks really nice and would match any decor. I always thought those large stands with all those dvd cases were an eye sore but not with these storage boxes. I prefer to hide my movies and games.2. Holds exactly 26 DVDs or 28 Blu-rays - That is a lot of cases and it holds them nicely. If you have all blu-ray cases, it holds 26 cases from front to back and since blu-ray cases are a little bit smaller than dvds, you have a little space on the side where you can fit 2 more blu-ray cases for a total of 28 CASES. I am actually using mine for 28 blu-ray playstation 3 cases.3. Price - Look at the low price!* I heard some people complain about that it is made out of cardboard. Look at the price you paid. What did you expect? It is but it is definitely a stronger material than a shoebox or a brown box cardboard. It is plenty strong enough to carry 26-28 cases (slightly less than 9 pounds). It isn't as strong as wood, metal or plastic but if you take reasonable care of the box, you really don't need wood, plastic or metal material for a box that weighs less than 9 pounds. And if you really wanted to go with a real wooden box with the faux leather, you will easily be paying at least 4 or 5 times more than this box. No thanks. Look it up as I searched the internet and the prices were very expensive. And lets forget those horrible looking cheap clear plastic cases as that isn't even an option!*I have yet to experience buttons popping loose. I am pretty careful and I don't expect to but if I do, I would edit this post. Right now for the low price, I give this storage box an 5 out of 5. I am going to purchase another one now.

The Philips branding is on the bulb itself, not on the case that encloses the bulb like my original.  Buy this one or another original Philips.  Do not waste your money on the cheap replacements.  You get what you pay for.  They do not last.  Installation took 5 minutes if that long.  No need to pay a repair man on this fix.

$REVIEW.: This is the best undercabinet am/fm radio bar none.  The quality of the buttons is excellent.  Battery backup is an added bonus.  The AM reception is excellent and doesn't suffer from whining/whistling/hiss like other radios.  The FM reception is very good.  Sound quality is very good, but if turned up too loud, there is slight distortion.  The CD player works flawlessly and has enough features for a kitchen.  The Audio IN jack is handy and this feature works well.  There is even a handy kitchen cooking timer (I sometimes need more than one cooking timer at once and my microwave only has one...).  Easy to mount, well built - highly recommended!!!

Since then, I go through one of these on an annual basis.  One had the characters wear off.  But, typically they just die.Ive tried other ergonomic keyboards.  It is hard to type on a standard one after using them so long.  But, quality is not a current hallmark of MS hardware product and they'll fight you under warranty.  Who'd have guess it is lower than their software offering?  OK, I jest but the jest is a tear stained one.

$review_text.: It's been over a month now since my purchase. The first week that I received them I was out and about testing them with my ipod. They stayed in my ears unless I got caught on something but now I just run the cord thru my shirt to my arm. Solved that problem quick.Overall the sound is great. I'm a bass head and these get the job done. Sometimes I forget they are in my ear because I don't feel them. I like the fact that it came with a carry case and 3 different ear piece sizes. Definitely a must for those whose ears aren't like everyone elses.I was very happy that the cords were even unlike previous models where one cord was shorter than the other one. That was very inconvient. My fiancee had the original ipod earphones and she couldn't find a good replacement so I bought her these too and she loves them. The price is on point also. For now I have no issues and don't think I will be getting rid of these anytime soon.

The biggest flaw to this mouse is it's receiver.  The snap on feature works fine, but ads bulk to the bottom of the mouse.  The biggest problem is that it breaks easily.  I've broken 2 of the receivers, now, both times they were attached to the computer and broke when lightly bumped.  Not dropped or slammed against a doorway, but when moving it on my desk and it catches on something and bends or cracks where the USB port meets the receiver.Pros:Easy to installAll features workMouse itself is durableLong battery lifeGood mouse rangeCons:Weak receiver constructionFeel in hand (subjective, I know)Receiver not integrated well into base

$REVIEW.: Great little netbook. wireless isn't that great in a big house.  but this is expected given that my other laptop didn't do great upstairs in my house either.  i'm putting in a wireless bridge, now.  the aspire one gets alot of attention when i use it.  you can walk around with it, like a hardbound book.  don't have to carry the power adapter, the battery is more than enough.  the only problem that i encountered was the screen was too small for a program that i use for work.  this was fixed by installing a program called AsTray that allowed me to change the resolution of the screen.  now, i can scroll down to get to that part of the screen that i didn't have access to before.  i'm burning all of the kids dvds on the the drive and taking this on our next vacation.  don't have to deal with dvd player battery dying on the flight.  i strongly recommend this product.

$review_text.: This wireless laser mouse is attractive, nicely packaged, and has the quality feel one associates with Kensington products. The little ball between the left and right buttons allows window scrolling in any direction, an appealing feature that works well enough. The included Windows software installs a handy System Tray applet for adjusting the scroll ball's sensitivity.I have not experimented with media controls which are on the bottom of the mouse. However, it appears to be too easy to accidentally jog the screen with the little scroll ball when you hold the mouse upside down to work the media control pad.My big problem with the SlimBlade Mouse is that it is very fussy about the surface it is used on. With my normal black fabric surfaced mouse pads, the cursor jumps about randomly, making the mouse torture to use.  Same problem on an oak surfaced desk. The mouse only works predictably on a scrap of grey urethane packaging foam. If your mouse pad has a sufficiently variegated surface, you probably won't have this problem.Note for those who don't read instructions: I couldn't find the little USB transmitter dongle when I opened the package. It's cleverly hidden in plain view inside the mouse's battery compartment.

$review_text.: I love how easy this speaker was to set up. In only 2 minutes I had it running and streaming the audio from my phone. I then set it up to work with my iPad. One of the very cool features of this product is the fact that its modular by design. Because of this you can add more speakers around your house and they will connect wirelessly to this main unit. The sound quality is pretty good and not tinny sounding at all. The bass is a bit lacking but that is just a tiny little nit pick.Pros:+ add this unit to any bluetooth transmitting device (phone, tablet, laptop).+ Expandable to all over the house with additional speakers+ Low cost makes it accessible.Cons:- Range is limited by the device's blue tooth range.- Bass is not as punchy as I would like (little niggle).Overall this is a great option for you to have in your home/office as a remote wireless speaker system.Thank you for reading my review.

However most of the microphones I have found were expensive or got bad reviews for the price


This TASCAM is a great little add on because it is only about $100, and does make a significant improvement in the audio


I like the X-Y pattern microphone opposed to the standard single piece

The sounds has improved quite nicely, and while I might not have the audio to make a theater released full feature film, for my short film usage, it will work out wonderfully.

$review_text.: I wanted this EVGA GTX-650 video card in order to play DX11 games on my Windows 7 PC. My wife bought it for me for Christmas. I installed it in January, and it worked well. I was able to play COD Ghosts, and Crysis 3. A few weeks later, the machine started acting up. It would freeze and require a power cycle to recover. Shortly after, my 1250W Cooler Master power supply was dead. The card had killed it by drawing too much power. I replaced the power supply, but still had problems from then on. The computer would freeze while doing ordinary tasks. It would not return from sleep mode most of the time, requiring a reboot or power cycle. My once reliable computer was a pain in the neck. Finally, after a freeze while doing my taxes, I decided that I had enough, and removed the card, replacing it with the old NVidia card that I had replaced. Immediately, the computer was restored to its reliable performance. Multiple sleep-wakeup cycles worked flawlessly. The card is obviously defective, and in addition to the card itself, it cost me $150.00 for a burned out power supply.UPDATE 03/31/2014:I won't change the two star rating, because the card was defective and did take out my power supply. I am updating the review to say that EVGA was great about the RMA process. I called them, and they made it easy to return the card for an exchange. But, I'm still out $150 for the power supply and another $15 to ship the defective card back to them. The new card is in my PC and working well. I will still have to see if they process the return and get me the collateral charge back on my credit card.

I'm from the vinyl generation who still likes to have something in hand to play from start to finish


When my NAD finally died I went in search of a machine


Did I have $500 to plunk down on a higher end player? My wife would say no
The task at hand was to get some quality gear for a reasonable price


Most people are not buying CD players anymore so the pickings are slim: really junky Sonys (what the heck happened to these guys?), multi-disc players, and then high-end pieces
I'm happy I came across this unit from a company I used to support as a kid

I beat the crap out of one their receivers with my Cerwin-Vega blasters


Here's their C-7030: clean design, simple, no bells & whistles, but lots of great reviews on Amazon and other places where the item is out of stock


My only minor complaint is that the front panel is so dark that I needed to memorize where the buttons are

You can also use the remote, which makes things easier, but I refuse to add another battery dependent item to my life

Onkyo also includes a basic RCA cable

I bought a solidBelkin PureAV RCA Audio Cable-6 feetinstead.

$review_text.: I've been a geocacher for over 10 years, so I've put my 60CSx through quite a lot (as I can tell from the many scratches on the ZAGG screen protector). I've recently noticed that, after all these years, the button and latch have worn down enough that, with a little force, the GPS can come loose from the clip without depressing the release. And I'm not getting that assuring "click!" sound when I slide the unit onto the holder. So I'm ordering this OEM Garmin replacement, and expect it to perform just as well, and for just as many years.I'm not sure I understand how people are breaking these. Are they clipping them on the front of their belts? Yeah, that's probably going to break something, when you bend over or crouch. At the very least, you clip it to the side, or near your back pocket. That's what I do, and I've never had a breakage problem. You can misuse just about anything, and break it. That doesn't mean it's a faulty product.

$REVIEW.: I got this on Cyber Monday, so it was obviously on sale. This is ok I guess. The main letdown to me is that it's slower than I thought it would be. You would think that it would be fast since it's dual core, but it's not. At least, not as speedy as my other Laptop. Also, the Touchpad seemed like it needed to be broken in, cause I was having a lot of problems with it when I first got it, but it's working fine the next day.What I do love about it is all the USB ports. I personally feel like you can never have enough USB ports! There's 4.Overall, this isn't a bad purchase. For the nonsale price, I'd buy something else.

$review_text.: I hated the look of this compared to a real ringflash. The catch light (reflection in the model's eyes) was very ugly-it's a u shape and not round (and also too small). Using this device with any background other than a wall or backdrop just yields shots that look like a normal flash shot.Considering that this is not really a flash or a light, but just a plastic adapter, and that you can get a real ringflash for not much more, the price on the Ray Flash is way too high. For say $100. it might be worth it as a toy to have in your bag for occasional use, but at $300., no way.

$review_text.: This is great case for the Macbook Air, I have been using it for months now. It is thin, so does not add much bulk, and the black version I bought looks smart. I like the slightly rubberized appearance, it feels good to hold and gives the case a matte finish. I like that the Apple logo glows through the case. The teeth that grip the case to the Macbook are small and relatively discrete, which is great.Note that oil from your hands tends to adhere to the case, but this is not so much a fault of the case, as it is carelessness on the part of the user. You can clean that off easily enough.

$REVIEW.: I was very excited unboxing my dropcam pro
 It was easy to set up right from the couch, I just plugged it in behind me and used my iphone to set up after downloading dropcam app
 When it does work, there is a slight delay in the audio/video which does not bother me


 But the camera has not been working


 When I load the app or website, I am usually left staring at a grey screen, or spinning circle indicating that the camera is "loading."  My camera is in the same room just 15 or so feet from my router, which is new, only a few months old
 Once the camera does load, I get a frozen image


 The timestamp stays frozen to exactly to when the camera finally loaded

 Performance is unacceptable...what good does the video quality do you if it does not work?  I will be returning and ordering a different camera from Amazon

 I will probably try the d-link or netgear vuezone.

$REVIEW.: We installed an outdoor antenna to pick up our over-the-air broadcasts better. We live in an area between two major metros and could only sorta tune in most stations. If it was cloudy, rainy, or snowing, forget about it. I talked to a friend and he told me to get this preamp for the outdoor antenna to help.  Honestly, I do not know if this thing is helping or not simply because we did not try the antenna without it. Since we have installed the antenna (and used about 125 feet of coax) we have great signal with no issues.The install is easy. On the antenna itself, you connect it, ground it, and mount it.  If you have ever screwed in coax cable to a TV or cable box, you can install this.  There is a little receiver you connect to the back of your TV which takes about two seconds to plug into your antenna port.We are now getting about 40 over-the-air stations with perfect reception.

$review_text.: This media player does not have the Netflix or Amazon Prime apps, however, it is a really good media player. If having either or both of those apps on your media player is important to you, keep looking, you needn't waste your time considering this media player. My Panasonic TV has the Netflix and Amazon Prime apps, so this media player not including those apps is not the slightest bit important to me.What is important to me in a media player is that it is easy to use, works well, streams my network content well, provides a top quality picture, and plays all file types. Well, I don't actually know if this player plays every single file type, it probably doesn't, but it has flawlessly played all the file types I've asked it to play, and it does everything else I just mentioned. If you're looking for an excellent player for your network content, this one is, in my opinion, the one to get.I've only owned this media player for about a month, but I really like it, and am really impressed with it. It works well, its picture quality is outstanding, and as I said, it plays everything I've asked it to. And personally, that's all I really want a media player to do. Consequently I am going to recommend this media player. In fact, I am recommending it highly. Do give this one a try. I'm quite confident you'll like it. And if you don't, you can just return it. Amazon makes returning stuff incredibly simple.If you have any questions about this media player, please feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to answer. I hope you found this review helpful.

$REVIEW.: I have a fairly complicated home network. I bought this to add one port behind my media center, had an old 100 Mbps 4-port Netgear back there before. Speed increased nicely but after a while everything lost connectivity. Switched the old 4 port back in and no problems. Put the TP Link back in and same result, great for a bit then nothing. Switched a different 1Gb TP-Link (TP-LINK TL-SG1005D) into the same place with the exact same result. Took it out to my office and switched it out for a Netgear 1Gb 5-port and the TP-Link worked perfectly in the office. Took the Netgear 5-port in and popped it in behind the media center and IT worked perfectly. So I don't know why, but neither TP-Link that I own works behind my media center but they both work perfectly, in fact VERY well, in my office. It's good enough so I'm leaving it for now. Puzzling though.

 He said it would be a waste of time to buy anything smaller than 500 GB, so I bought this 1 TB hard drive

 When I plugged it in at home it automatically backed up my home PC

 I didn't want it to, it just did

 It also set a day and time to backup, which I didn't want


 I took this portable hard drive to an IT friend and explained my problem

$review_text.: I received theseDayton B652 6-1/2" 2-Way Bookshelf Speaker Pairspeakers recently and I have played them for many hours. The amplifier I used mostly is theDayton DTA-1 Class T Digital Amplifier 15 WPCwhich works beautifully with them; this versatile and excellent amplifier can be powered by AC or by batteries. (I can also highly recommend theDayton Audio DTA-100a Class-T Digital Amplifier 50 WPC, which, though somewhat more expensive, is more powerful - no battery operation though.)I am currently using thisStanton S.300 Tabletop CD Player with MP3 Compatibilityas my source and I have played a large number of classical CDs.The sound is quite amazing for such inexpensive speakers. It would be amazing if the cost were four times their low price. No kidding!They do seem to work best in a near-field arrangement but they also easily fill up my bedroom with fine sound. I have them placed on theseDayton SSMB24 24" Speaker Stand Pair Square Steel Base, about six feet apart, and four feet from the rear wall (and more than that from the side walls).The bass is not going to "knock your socks off" - but it is certainly not lacking either. I am pretty picky when it comes to my audio equipment and, believe me, this entire system, which cost less than $235.00 (or $289.00) all told, is amazing in quality and value.It's quite a sound system!If you want absolute top quality equipment and sound, you must be willing to pay commensurate prices. But this small system, which could not function nearly as well without these speakers and still cost so little, is all most people need for normal-sized rooms. In my opinion, the sound quality from these speakers is very smooth and very pleasant. Listening for several hours induced no "listener fatigue" whatsoever.These speakers, along with the other components I mentioned, would also be an ideal choice for a child's first sound system. He/she will appreciate the sound quality and, in fact, the fortunate child who is given a pair of these speakers will never "outgrow" them. Even if the child obtains "better" speakers some year down the road, that child will ALWAYS find a place for these.At their current price, I give them my highest recommendation - and I also recommend the other components I mention; this is an excellent small sound system, one of which anyone would be proud.(I should mention that I now own FOUR (4) sets of these speakers, all bought at different times, and all purchased directly from Parts Express; all four perform equally well with absolutely no sonic differences.)===============================================================================================================================================Update: December 20, 2012This speaker has been reviewed in the January 2013 issue of STEREOPHILE. It is the least costly speaker they have ever reviewed. (In the same issue they review a pair of Wilson Audio speakers which sell for $200,000.00!) The actual review of these Dayton speakers, by Stephen Mejias, and the technical measurements, by John Atkinson, show just how good this speaker is and can be found online merely by 'Googling' &lt; Dayton Audio B652 Stereophile >. I think that they both were very surprised. This one can easily compare with speakers four times its price and even some which are SEVEN times its price.I suggest that anyone interested order a pair and carefully listen to them.Remember - if you don't like what you hear, you can always return them.But I'll bet you won't!

$REVIEW.: The Antec MX-25 enclosure is very pretty looking and works well
The case body is made of very "nice feeling" very sturdy plastic

The inside, both top and bottom, is lined with a sturdy metal plate
Assembly is super simple - just slide the drive into the case (engaging the connector of the circuit board of course) and secure the cover with one screw
The case also comes with a little self adhesive "tab" to assist in pulling the drive up and out of the case
You can use it or not


It's not essential.Now for some observations and hints:* The case has a very bright blue LED activity indicator


It really is too bright
I actually replace mine with normal brightness green lights.* Data transfer rates for USB and eSATA are, interestingly, almost identical.* The controller board in the case supports USB 2.0 and eSATA

It works in a USB 3.0 connection, but only at USB 2.0 speeds.* The case is designed for "standard" 9.5mm thick laptop drives

A 12.5mm drive will not fit without a case modification (described below).* A standard 9.5mm laptop drive fits slightly loose in the case, causing a disconcerting "rattle"
This can be cured by folding up one sheet of 8.5x11 printer paper and placing it in the case BELOW the drive.* The case does not come with little rubber feet

It should.* The case comes with a special "three head" USB cable that is supposed to supply both power and data to the drive

It is not necessary to use this cable


Any USB cable works fine and separate power is not needed.Here's a hint for utilizing 12.5mm thick laptop drives (such as the new 750GB and 1.0TB models):Before installing the drive, carefully remove the internal metal plates from both the top and bottom of the case


The metal plates are held in place with double sided tape

Just grab an edge and pull carefully until it comes out


Pull slowly and let the tape "give" at it's own rate
Be CAREFUL as the metal plate edges can be sharp and cut a finger.After removing the plates, a thick 12.5mm laptop drive will fit the case perfectly!If any residual adhesive from removing the plates remains, you can try to rub it off with a finger or pull it up with tape, but do not use any solvents as they will ruin the case (I found that out the hard way) LOL!

$REVIEW.: First off, understand that this review assumes that you're going to use a graphics card in your desktop computer.  Do NOT buy any i5 processor except the i5-3570K if you intend to use the integrated graphics.  The unlocked i5-3570K includes Intel Graphics 4000, whereas my i5-3550 and below all use Graphics 2500.  The difference is very substantial and more than justifies the extra $30 to $40 for the i5-3570K.That said, I've upgraded to an i5-3550 from a SandyBridge Pentium G620.  You can find my reviews of the Pentium G620 and of my Biostar TZ68A+ motherboard by clicking on my name.From a performance standpoint, the i5-3550 is a minor revision of the SandyBridge i5 processors that have been on the market for a year now.  Performance is well known and doesn't need to be rehashed here.In case you're not familiar with Intel's tick-tock strategy, Intel upgrades either its processor design or its production machinery each year, but not both in the same year.  An upgrade in the processor design is a "tock" while an upgrade in production machinery is a "tick."  This year's change from SandyBridge to IvyBridge is a "tick," meaning that the design is pretty much unchanged.I've taken off one star because the "tick" from SandyBridge to IvyBridge hasn't done much of anything to improve value to the consumer.  Value equals performance divided by price. "Tocks" have always improved value because performance goes up with a new design while price remains the same.  In theory, "ticks" should also improve value because performance stays the same but the price should go down.The big deal with IvyBridge is that Intel's "tick" to 22nm fabrication has cut Intel's cost of manufacture by 25-35% relative to a 32nm SandyBridge with the same number of transistors.  IvyBridge could have delivered a significant increase in value had Intel chosen to split its cost savings with consumers.  Instead, the cost savings is going entirely into shareholder value.So, IvyBridge ends up having SandyBridge performance at SandyBridge pricing.  That's no reason to avoid the i5-3550, but there's really nothing here to cheer about.  You might be better off with a mild overclock on a Sandybridge i5-2500K if the price is right.As for turboboost, I'm finding that it works a little better than expected.  The i5-3550 is specified to have a base clock of 3.3 GHz with four cores under load and a turboboost to 3.7 GHz with only one core under load.  What I find is that my i5-3550 never runs at less than 3.5 GHz while all four cores are maxed out in Prime95.  In other words, turboboost is delivering a two step improvement even during a worst case multithreaded task.  This is only a 6% improvement over spec, but it's free.Oddly, my initial results were still limited to 3.5 GHz when I ran SuperPi, which is a single threaded stress test.  I didn't see the turbo to 3.7 GHz until I disabled the C1E halt state in BIOS.These results were obtained with the motherboard clock at its default 100 MHz.  The non-K i5 processors are locked against MB clock increases, of course, but you can still increase the MB clock to 103 MHz without having the lock kick in.  This translates to an additional one step increase in CPU frequency.  Again, this is only a 3% increase, but it's free.So, my i5-3550 is actually delivering 3.6 GHz continuously with all four cores loaded and with spikes up to 3.8 GHz if only one core is loaded.  It's always nice to get a little more than expected.To its credit, the i5-3550 does run cool.  Temps stay under 55 degrees C even when all four cores are running at 3.6 GHz with 100% loading in Prime95.  I'm using aCooler Master Hyper 212 Plus 120mm Sleeve CPU Cooler, RR-B10-212P-G1.  But you should buy the newCooler Master Hyper 212 EVO CPU Cooler (RR-212E-20PK-R2)instead if it's only a few dollars more.

$REVIEW.: I was looking for a cheap solution to cover myself from any speeding tickets or red light cameras. I picked up this Cobra for $40 based on my price bracket. It had the sleekest looks out of all the detectors in the same price range. It comes with a 6' 12v lighter socket cable and a suction cup windshield mount that holds the detector with velcro. I found that the adhesive on the backside of the velcro wasn't so great and ended up using industrial strength double sided tape instead. I had the detector mounted directly behind my rearview mirror, but low enough that the rear sensor can pick up radar from behind. I ran the power cable through my a-pillars and into the ceiling trim for a nice, clean look. I've tested the strength and reliability of this detector personally using a variable speed limit sign mounted in my company parking lot; this detector easily picks up the sign from over 500 feet away, regardless if I'm heading towards or away from it. Yes, like ALL DETECTORS it goes off when it sees automatic doors or other devices that throw electromagnetic energy. This is why when you're driving around the city it'll go off seemingly at random when there are no police present. Please educate yourself on how detectors work if you think this is abnormal. Furthermore, not EVERY police offer drives around with their radar on, many flip them on while driving past suspected speeders. The best way to not get a speeding ticket is simple - don't speed. If you have to, be aware of your surroundings and use the detector as a second, not first, option.I'd highly recommend this little guy for anyone looking to spend around $40-50 for a great detector.
$SUMMARY.: Excellent radar detector

$review_text.: I still love the HDTV.  The smart TV processor is under-powered.  If I want to do Amazon or Netflicks, I click and wait and wait and wait.  I though it might be the wireless, but the set is now hardwired into my network and still the wait, wait, wait.  This is a great TV.  Just don't buy it for the smart features.  Better yet, buy a dumb TV and find another place to get the smart features like XBox, Roku, or Amazon's new product.The second problem I have with the TV is the annoying remote.  When I'm sitting on the sofa, I like to keep the remote next to me.  If this remote is bumped, you get the mouse cursor.  If the remote is lightly brushed, you get a quick channel change.  I have a ridiculous number of remotes, but none are this annoying.  Just tap the thing and I'm reminded that I haven't put it 'out of the way' to its own space on the side table.  This remote would be greatly improved if you have to press a button before it's activated.Since the purchase of this TV, I purchased a ROKU for my bedroom TV.  ROKU is amazing.  It does Amazon streaming and its user interface is more intuitive.  I actually want to purchase a 2nd ROKU for this new smart TV.  When you want to buy a smart box for your smart TV, then there is something very wrong.

$review_text.: I'm not very experienced in the ways of DVD burning, but these discs get the job done.  I've been converting VHS movies to mp4 files on my PC, and I needed to back them up to DVD permanently in case of a hard drive failure.  After spending a couple of hours doing research and comparing products/prices on Amazon and retail stores, I went with these.  My first burn was probably the toughest, as I chose to burn my converted version of "The Patriot" to DVD.  It's the longest and largest mp4 file I had.  I used Daniusoft DVD Creator as my burning software.  Because this was such a large file and I had no other way to shrink it without further reducing the quality, I had to use the D9 setting in conjunction with the "Standard" quality setting.  Despite this and it taking two hours to burn, the results are impressive.  It looks and sounds nearly as good as the original VHS tape, and my 10+ year old DVD player handled it with no problem.  It even upscales the 4:3 DVD to fit our 16:9 widescreen without significant quality loss or picture cutoff.  Overall, these discs appear to be a great value and I am pleased with the results.  I've burned several now and still haven't created any coasters.  When purchasing DVDs, remember that you need a drive that is capable of burning a Dual Layer DVD, and to also review your program settings to make sure the file will fit the DVD or that the program can even burn those file types.  I'm no pro at DVD editing, but my experience working on computers tells me that the people who are having trouble and complain on here are just having software or hardware issues.  These could be fixed with a 20 dollar investment in a Dual Layer capable drive, or if you have a dinosaur machine, an upgrade to a new computer.  Quality burning software may help too, I'm getting by just fine with the free Windows DVD Maker and the not so free Daniusoft DVD Creator.

$REVIEW.: This is my second MS4000 keyboard. I wore the first one out. If you use this keyboard with the front riser in (as it comes out of the box) your hands will slide onto the keyboard in a natural position which is slightly sloping downwards. This will take a day or two to get used to but after that is feels great. This keyboard does have a break in the middle but it is not nearly as extreme as the old split keyboards. This one feels natural and I can reach both sides of the split with no issues. The palm rest is an added benefit as well. There is a good number of buttons you can program on this keyboard and I have done so in the past and they work great but all in all this is a great feeling keyboard. If you use the computer all day like I do you should enjoy this keyboard

$REVIEW.: This is just like the rest of the battery back-up devices out in the market today.This devices attached to your computer via USB and gives the user about 25 minutes of time before the battery is drained

 The device has a connection for two telephone lines only, no Ethernet connection, or cable connection
 There are 4 outlets on the battery pack that will use battery power if the power should go off, and two outlets that act as the usual surge protector


The outlets on the pack are space apart to accommodate things like cell phone plugs, etc


 The unit is very heavy and not as to big
 The unit is quick to let you know if there is a wiring fault, with its indicator light, and also alerts you with an audible noise when it is not getting any juice
 All in all I would say this would be a good investment for a home user at just $40.

It really was DOA.  I called Amazon and they took the took the old one and the new one is just wonderful.You'll like the fact that you get so much more screen space with the thin edge.At the price point it's a real buy.  I guess you could spend double the money and a little bit better blacks but for me this is just a wonderful set.Once it's setup right the picture is wonderful.

$review_text.: I'm writing this using the Perixx PERIBOARD-311 PLUS just received from the good folks at Amazon, hoping I cover all my bases.I have been using the Logitech Illuminated keyboard for years, and have paid anywhere from $50 to $80 dollars for them. They are wonderful for general typing, exceptionally comfortable and silent. In fact, the Logitech Illuminated is the most silent keyboard I have ever used. But they are horrid for gaming. Logitech engineered into the keyboard what is known as phantom key blocking to prevent gamers from using the SHIFT + W + SPACE key combination, which is essential for any sort of competitive gaming experience. The idea was that gamers would then buy the more expensive Logitech gaming keyboards without key blocking. Keep in mind that keyboards do not generally have key blocking; it has to be engineered into them.The problem with most gaming keyboards is that they are especially loud, and gaming keyboards with mechanical switches can be exceptionally loud. I stuck with the Logitech Illuminated keyboards only because I could find no better, silent alternative.The PERIBOARD does not have key blocking, making it more suitable for gaming than the Logitech Illuminated. If you play games, rest assured SHIFT + W + SPACE will work just fine, as it does on most any normal keyboard.As for the rest of it, let me start by saying I've never used a chicklet-style keyboard before, but I love low-profile shot-throw keyboards (the sort found on most laptops, and the Logitech Illuminated). The chicklet keys are instantly familiar and comfortable to anyone fond of laptop keys. They have the same low profile and short throw (travel distance between the top and bottom of the key switch). The spacing between keys is splendid, even delightful, making the PERIBOARD more comfortable and accurate than the Logitech Illuminated keyboard.The keys themselves have a matte surface and subtle texture I am not used to; they are not slippery-smooth. I must say that, initially, I was a bit put off by the texture, which I assume was engineered to increase accuracy. After all, those slippery key caps tend to have more deeply sculpted tops. I will not express a further opinion without having used the keyboard more extensively, as that would simply be unfair and closed-minded.The key switches have a very nice spring to them, more than the Logitech Illuminated, which often feels mushy and sloppy, especially in comparison to the PERIBOARD. So let me say that the PERIBOARD has the superior feel and responsiveness. I can tell when I've hit a key, something gamers and skilled touch typists will appreciate. Thing is, this keyboard is also slightly louder than the Logitech Illuminated, which I can barely hear myself when I work. And I really do mean that it is only slightly louder. I doubt it will make a difference in my situation, having my better half sleeping just feet away while I work or play late into the night.The backlighting is subtle and uneven. The letter keys exhibit the most lighting, the number keys a bit less, and the function keys less still. That may be good or bad, depending upon your needs. I rarely use function keys, so perhaps this is the best design for me. However, there is significant light leakage under the keys. On some keyboards, that is considered a feature, or part of the appeal. If the light was anything other than white, I would think it a feature, myself. As it stands, the leakage does not keep me from using or recommending the board, but I will subtract a star from my rating because of it. You will be happy to know that the illumination does turn on and off with your computer (many cheap LED backlit keyboards must be turned on and off manually).The PERIBOARD is small, sleek, slender, and elegant like a super model. I paid $30 for mine, and it looks like it would have cost more. It feels like it would cost more. It is not a cheap keyboard; I have had plenty of those--you can buy them at the local Walmart for $10. The more I type on this keyboard, the more I like it. I would like to try one that had smoother key caps, but, again, I'm aware such a thing could end up causing more problems than it's worth. I'm going to order a couple more as spares, because one never knows what the future may bring.I heartily recommend this keyboard to anyone needed a quiet, gaming-friendly plank--especially if you like the look and feel of low-profile short-throw keyboards, or are comfortable on a laptop keyboard.

The time of delivery was within their specifications but it took awhile for them to arrive.  The cost is very good, though, for the product that it is.  For her new SmartPhone, though, my wife insisted on a stylus with a smaller touch surface--these will touch keys to the side of the one you want if you aren't very careful and if your cellphone has keys close to each other.

Most chargers put out the USB standard 166 ma but this puts out 272 ma for a much faster charge.

$review_text.: I realize that this is half-price with a Fire order, but even at that cost point, and certainly at full price, I'd recommend you look elsewhere.Continuing with the Kindle Fire HD theme of "why in the world did they put the cable port there" - the starring act of which is the inclusion of the charging port on the left ("bottom" in landscape mode) side of the Fire HD - this adapter not only is big enough that it will potentially block other outlets by itself, but the cable comes out of the bottom side of it, meaning that it might block multiple outlets on a power strip as well.There are numerous ~10W adapters which will not block other outlets and which have the cable coming "out" of the outlet, so as not to block things. For this price - half off and certainly full price - you can find one with the same or better power specs, likely with two ports (for charging one 10W device or two lower-power devices), which also has a folding plug (such as theIPAD-2USB), and which won't block outlets.Yes, the box it comes in is very well-designed, almost Apple-like. Yes, the fit and finish are nice. Yes, if you have plenty of outlet space and don't want a 10W adapter (this one is only 9W, which will be an issue with some devices that want 10W), this will work for you. For me, if they'd have moved the plug from the "bottom" to a "side", most of my issues would go away, at least at half price. At full price? This isn't worth it.

$REVIEW.: I have owned this lens for a week now, and I am delighted with it. It has been a long time since I owned a prime lens and I had forgotten what they could do. I am getting sharp sharp sharp images in a variety of situations. I can crop closer due to the quality of the pictures. Indoor and out, this lens is is doing a really nice job. It is light, focuses fast and quietly, and allows the little focus tweek that is needed now and then in auto mode. I am using it on my D-60 and I have not taken it off since it arrived. It will not take the picture for you, but following basic rules and techniques of photography it will help you get that shot. The MSRP on this one places it in reach of everyone. It is worth the wait, or check your local camera store if you need it sooner. An exciting lens.Update: June 20,2009I have had this lens for about a month now. I could not be more pleased with it. I find myself picking up the camera more often just to go out and see what I can find to take pictures of. Do not be afraid of moving around to compose your picture or the lack of VR. The sharpness and low light capabilities are far more important for getting that special image captured forever. Can you tell that I am thrilled with the results I am getting? My local camera shop has them for the MSRP of $199.99, don't overpay if you can help it.Update December 2011This lens has turned out to be a superior lens for so many photo situations I can still highly recommend it. I have used it heavily for about 1 1/2 years, changed camera bodies, and it is still flawless. I have added a sb400 flash to my kit for color improvement indoors, and this is really a simple winning combination for the new Nikon DSLR user as well as a more advanced user. I this year have used it at 2 weddings and several family get together's in some odd lighting situations with super results. Sharp, fast, light weight, functional and a real bargain.

$review_text.: I've been wanting to get an 802.11n router since I began doing more home networking
 Even my XBOX was telling me that my b/g router was holding me back and might impact my ability to stream higher-definition content.I started looking at n routers vs
b/g and I was sold by the speed increase (up to 300 vs 54) as well as the increase in range (4x).There was definitely quality put in to the refurb and packaging process of this unit; wen I opened it up, I would have had no idea this wasn't new


 It was clean, packed well, and worked fine right out of the box

 Setup with my existing Verizon router was no problem at all once I found the instructions online on how to do a lan-to-lan connection
 For the refurb cost vs

new, it was a no-brainer to buy this one


 I updated firmware to the latest rev just to be sure I was up-to-date

 I did not install the software off of the included CD.-1 star because the range is really no better than my old b/g router


 My signal still fades significantly in my kitchen which is about 30 feet from my router location

 I did a little reading online and I've seen some reports of this for the lower-end linksys routers
 At 4x the range for an n router vs

b/g, I expected to be anywhere in my house or yard and have a good signal

 I'm going to do some relocating to see if there are line-of-sight or obstruction issues that are impacting the range.-1 star because speed isn't what I expected either

 I didn't expect any increase in internet speed because I know I'm limited by my 25/25 Verizon FiOS package, but I expected it to maintain higher numbers when connecting device-to-router


 My phone comes in at about 65, my tablet around 100, and when I take a look at the connection speed with my laptop it's about 150 Mbps
 I know that the n routers will drop speed when other devices are identified on the channel; I'm probably in a congested area

 I also know that certain devices can't take advantage of the full throughput of the n routers

 So to be fair, my expectations were probably too high around the speed increase I'd see.In terms of value for the price, I'm completely pleased; overall, I might have been expecting more than what an 802.11n router can realistically deliver.EDIT: 1/28/2013 - This router started to get flaky after a few days of use


 Ended up having to do a reset on it, then I started having connection issues

 I already picked up a dual-band n router locally (cost about 5X as much) and it's a significant step up in performance
 My tablet even connects to it at the 5 GHz frequency, which is completely unused in my neighborhood (no interference).

$SUMMARY.: Good value for the money but not much better than my b/g router

My requirements?1) Light2) Can play 1080p videos, thru the HDMI port, using the CoreAVC codecs.3) Huge battery life (when using optimus on Windows 7 Pro+)Although I could settle with an iPad, I needed the keyboard, and to be able to run some Windows software like MikTeX, to work on my thesis.The cons:1) The screen is kind of small, but not unusable small2) Windows Starter - it would be better to come with no OS at all!Summing all up, I am very happy with my netbook

$review_text.: I didn't use the provided software (mainly because I don't have a CD drive on my e-book laptop and I am too lazy to go get my external CD drive).  Instead, I downloaded & installed the appropriate drivers for this cable from Miklor dot com.  Make sure you get the driver that matches your computer's operating system (different drivers for Windows 7 and XP).  After you install the driver, plug in the cable and wait for Windows to fully recognize it (give it about 30 seconds).  Go into your device manager (look under USB devices or ports - I can't remember) and open the device (it will be named &#34;Prolific&#34;).  It will tell you which COM port has been assigned to the cable (make a note of the COM port number).  Plug the other end of the cable into your radio (make sure the radio's plastic port cover is pulled all the way back, otherwise the pins on this cable won't insert all the way into the jacks on the radio).  Now, download & install CHIRP (i think I got it from Miklor also).  When you clone (download) your radio's settings into CHIRP, it will ask you for the COM port.  CHIRP will remember the COM port setting for future use.  If you need help installing drivers or using CHIRP, there are some very good tutorials on Youtube.  Have fun!

$REVIEW.: Having just received the iAudio G3 for Christmas, my first impression is "wow" as many have said before me.  I have never used an MP-3 player, I can only say what I have found.  Mostly PROS:This one is easy to figure out, at least for me.  You plug it in to your computer USB, drag & drop your music files, close it and off you go.  I have subsequently installed the JetShell, and that makes it even easier.As for sound, ( I ditched the crappola ear-bugs they sent and got a set of Sennheiser PX 100--another "wow")....I can't believe how crisp, and clean this machine performs.  The bass is just right for me.  But the real joy is in the fullness of total sound.  I have turned around a couple of times to see who was following me with a violin,  slide guitar, or a full symphony orchestra.  It is beautiful.I personally love the AA batteries, this is my style....& you can get them anywhere... I agree with many who said the battery cover looks like it may snap off, but wait and see.  I'll let you know. & right now 2 gigs seems like a lot of music, but enough is never enough.CONS:1.  It is a little clumsy moving around the selection format  (changing songs).  I can imagine other players have this down, so that it only takes a moment to find another song or album.  Maybe this is an "Old dog--new trick" thing, or an iAUDIO G3 thing?2.  Not really any more...[EXCEPT for the glaring need for decent earphones]......yet.In conclusion, If you want to simply have access to really great sounds to take on a walk, work-out or whatever, this provides beautiful, easy performance, just plan on adding quality earphones!  What it lacks in bells and flash, it makes up for in practicality.  'Being happy doesn't mean everything's perfect. It means you've decided to see beyond the imperfections'.Last but not least, my walks are now twice as long as before Christmas, and a lot more fun.
$SUMMARY.: Very happy with Santa & iAUDIO

$REVIEW.: Even if your earphones aren't made by Sony, the pack of six of these generics is approximately the same price Amazon is getting for a pack of eight Sony Hybrid Replacement Earbuds (in black or white--sometimes the color makes a dollar difference)

 "Hybrid" refers to the stiffer silicone of the inner ring of the tip, which assures both a better fit and superior audio

Unlike cheaper and softer replacements, they don't simply "collapse" when inserted in the ear
 Consequently, they don't fall out as easily or become a barrier instead of an open duct for the sound
Moreover, the inner ring is color-coded, for fast and efficient identification of size and proper pairing.Most replacement tips are essentially worthless

 I've learned to stick with Sony Hybrids or, if you don't find them cost-prohibitive, the foam tips made by Comply (each tip is specially fitted to your preferred brand and model of earphone--the foam material is virtually "transparent," offering no obstruction to the sound and expanding upon insertion, thus ensuring a tight yet comfortable fit).

$REVIEW.: If you have a external hard drive that quits working this might help you get to that data, it did for me.If you rebuild computers and want to check what's on a drive real quick,If you are in a pinch and trying to reload Windows onto a netbook (no cd drive), you can take an internal (loose) cd/dvd drive using the power and usb cable included to get Windows off your loose cd drive and onto your netbook.There are many uses for these cables. I recommend them to anyone with a midlevel knowledge of computers because they have helped me in so many different ways. I keep mine in a large Ziplock bag when not in use.

$review_text.: I used to live breath and sleep Cisco and Linksys for my networking. I would praise them and recommend only them to my customers friends and family. Now I would not even wish the misfortune of buying a Cisco Small Business/Home product upon my worst enemies.I had a fairly old Linksys WRT54G and figured it was time to upgrade as it's wireless signal was not cutting it any more, I could barely connect while in the room directly over the routers location.I made my first mistake by not heeding the warnings other reviewers left, this product really is that bad.I made my second by not buying through amazon, Microcenter probably would have taken it back had I brought it in but I made my third mistake. Which was thinking that the problem was me and I would eventually figure it out. Not only was the product total garbage for what I wanted it to do, the customer support was a complete joke. I called Cisco four times in total and each time I got the same response, almost to the exact wording: Reset to factory settings, update firmware, adjust settings, wait a few days to see if the problem returns. Each time the problem returned with in 24 hours and the last time it reoccurred no more than 30 seconds after I got off of the phone with the representative. Twice I was told they would call me back to check in and both times I received no phone call or email of any kind.I have "fixed" the problem myself but I find it very difficult to call it a solution when I paid over $200 for a wireless N router and I am unable to use the wireless aspect. The core problem was heat, I actually placed it in front of my air conditioning unit and it still overheated and locked up. It also locked up when there was more than two wireless devices connected and it locked up with in seconds of a apple device connecting to it. When it does work it interferes with my really really expensive wireless 7.1 surround sound headset(which makes me extremely unhappy), both wireless phone systems and if I can actually get some traffic going through it I experience a drop in my cellular phones signal (approximately %30-%50). Considering how rare it is for it to actually work properly I am going to say it is possible for all of that to be an excessively convenient coincidence for Cisco and a very inconvenient one for me. Because I spent close to $1400 for my other equipment I decided to replace the router if it kept acting up. By completely disabling the wireless it has run quite well for close to three month with absolutely no problems. I still believe there are bugs in the firmware as on a few occasions I attempted to reactivate the wireless and the router locked up almost instantaneously. After this and working on network s with other Cisco devices, as I said before, I can no longer recommend a Cisco/Linksys product to any of my customers, friends, or family at least from the Small Business or Home areas. I have not come across any issues with their larger commercial grade devices.If you are looking for a wired only router and security device this is a great option, for wireless look elsewhere, and if you have any problems don't call the customer support as they will just give you the run around over and over again. In a nut shell,if you buy a product you expect it to do what it is supposed to do without major modification.I have just realized I neglected to elaborate on the exact problem I was having. The router would lock up at seemingly random points and I would have to power cycle the device to restore functionality. This causes problems when the network goes down and I am not home. My parents are not the most tech savvy couple so I had to, on two occasions, return home to reset the device. We had two businesses and my father ran the local PAL program so being connected to the internet for his email was kind of important.I will return if and when I find a more effective solution to this problem.

$REVIEW.: I tried my best to use the DD-WRT pre installed software; the settings just didn't work well. I then downloaded and installed the "1.86 EZ setup" software.which the "wizard" had a problem detecting my internet connection. I did fix it manually by going to the "WAN/LAN settings. Then it was EZ.Once its configured, its a hot smoking router.I'm going to stay with the Buffalo firmware until I read more reviews on updates to the DD-WRT firmware which I don't think is ready for prime time.I'd give the router 5 stars, but the instructions and the software are lacking.I did talk once to the Buffalo tech support based in Texas; helped me tweak it a little; 5 stars to them.Be sure an give your comments in a review; it will help all of us and Buffalo as well.

$review_text.: Not only is it just the length I was looking for (don't you just hate when your phone unplugs accidentally because the cord is too short?!), but it charges my Android phone super fast! The only reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars is I dropped my phone once whilst this was plugged in and the metal part that goes into the phone (sorry I don't know the term) got slightly bent as did my old one. Yes I have a knack for destroying phone chargers but I guess they are all built this way. Nonetheless, this charges my phone mega fast compared to the chargers they sell in stores.

$REVIEW.: I am pleased with this purchase. It takes about 1 minute to boot to a useable state with 58 processes running in the background. With just a dual core processor, I am surprised at its speed. My desktop with quad core processor @ 3.67 GHz takes about 2 minutes to boot but then it has Windows 7 and 88 processes running. Windows 8 takes a little getting used to and some apps that run on Windows 7 may not run on Windows 8. Power desk 8 is one example. Battery life is really good. I booted off the battery after fully charged, ran a few apps and it lasted 6 hours with 48 minutes remaining. For the price it is a great replacement for my old desktop that finally died. The display is crisp and clear and somewhat glossy but the viewing angle is a bit narrow. I did not want another desktop to clutter my desk and this laptop works for me as my backup very well.

$REVIEW.: This is a great unit.  Nice design.  Enclosure is well made.  My unit came nicely boxed with a USB3 cable, a power cable that plugs into a uSB2/3 port, and a face plate.  Some other buyers complained that the face plate was not included but it was in my unit.  I use Windows 7 x64 Home and it was recognized immediately.  On my laptop it took a while to get working correctly since I have only 2 USB/3 ports and I had used them for other devices (USB sound card, flash drive, etc...).  It works in USB2 but Windows will give a message that &#34;the drive works better in a USB3 prto.  I had to uninstall the Microsoft installed drivers 2 or 3 times and reinstall the drive before it worked correctly.  It worked just fine on my PC though, right from the start.  So I suspect it was my laptop.  I played DVD movies from it and the playback was slow.  Not unexpected since USB is slow for playback.  I solved this by increasing the buffer on my player...I used VLC.  After that the movies playback just fine.  Also the unit has a plastic pressure tab on either side internally which are was squeeze against the DVD, once inserted, and keeps it from falling out (no screws needed... nice).  Problem I had is that my DVD had a sharp edge on one side which prevented the drive from being inserted.  I remedied this but taking a screwdriver and using the shaft to burnish the edge smooth that was getting it caught.  After that it slid in without any problems.  It takes slight force to insert it and a bit of wiggling since the fit is tight, but once in, it seats well and there is no play in the DVD drive.  The face plate appears to be a universal type.  It fit the DVD that came with my Lenovo G780.Pros:  compact. just slightly bigger that the DVD drive itself. enclosure is well made.  easily recognized by Win7x64. nice design. came with faceplate.Cons: the micro USB receptacle on the unit. other users complained that it was fragile.  it appears to be, so take great care when plugging the USB3 cable into the unit or moving the unit around while plugged in.  Try not to apply to much pressure on it since it looks like it might break.  A regular USB3 receptacle would have been better.  The supplied cables are very stiff.  Depending on where you plan to place the unit you might have to &#34;unbend&#34; the cables so they do not apply too much pressure on that micro USB receptacle.The reason for the 4 stars is that this is an external unit which usually gets abused.  The connectors should have been made more robust for that same reason and the cables not as stiff.  Overall this is a nice unit that I would recommend.  Aside from the slow transfers I am happy with it.  Keep in mind that this is for a 12.7mm, tray type drive only.

$review_text.: I bought this to protect a win8 touch screen laptop.  There weren't many in this size to choose from in the store at order time.  Anti-glare is nice, and the thickness doesn't seem to affect the use of the touch screen.When applying the thick film, I was able to see that I needed to remove and re-align it several times before finally committing.  It handled this nicely, much better than I expected.In the end the application was difficult to make "bubble free", due to dust and static in the air.I guess its not fair to this product to take off stars for my real issue, but I'm going to share it as it may help someone else:Winter time in the north midwest usa is not the time or place to install rigid screen protectors.  No matter what I did to clean the screen, blow off the dust, discharge static electricity from myself or the device, a particle or two would get between the film and the screen. It's pretty amazing how large a bubble can be created by a speck of dust behind a firm screen like this. BTW, a Dyson vacuum doesn't pick up much of anything from the room I was working in either, so the work space was *clean*.  I don't have access to a real "clean room" facility either... sigh.  Plan accordingly.

$review_text.: Bought these directly from Zagg, but below is my review of how these hold up to workouts...I've tried over 10 different pairs of B/T headphones over the last 2 1/2 years

All have broken under my rigorous workouts after a maximum of 4-6 months


Usually the signs of wear come in at 3-4 weeks of ownership


The 2 main issues I always face are either structural damage or electrical damage

While I am sure many of those headphones wold hold up to normal use, under my conditions they did not
Well, I have owned these Coda Forte's for about 1 month and a half

First, I have Medium-Large ears and these rest &#34;ON MY EARS&#34; If you have smaller ears you may have a better over the ear experience
I prefer over/around the ear but this is as close as I have ever gotten with Bluetooth Headphones


One thing I notice, because I sweat a lot, is that these make a very good seal


The sweat doesn't pour into the &#34;speaker cavern&#34;, as I like to call it! After my workout a quick towel rub down eliminates 99.9% of all moisture accumulated on the padding
So far the electronic components have not suffered, and I believe it is because of this seal


The headphones are not huge and don't stand out like those HORRID Beats By Dre


They are about Medium in size


The shape is pretty cool, I think they got that right because of how ears are naturally shaped
Size adjustments are easy and pairing is a snap! I have had Zero issues with these headphones to date


If these last me a year or more I'll be back to update
That is the aim for me on a product like this 18-24 months as I subject these things through the worst sweaty workouts you can think of


Gross review? Maybe! But very matter of fact! If there is another person like me on the hunt out there, I want them to know this is the product they want to give a try before they have spent as much money as I have
I know these are marketed it seems to &#34;Gamers&#34; but they have done quite well for this &#34;Jock&#34;! Thank You!

$review_text.: My last GPS was a Magellan 800. It worked very well was much larger, and in the Xterra, bounced a lot if you did not pin the GPS to the dash rather than have it hanging on the mount, not a big problem. It did not talk as much, but it's use of English was much clearer. I live in Omaha Nebraska and often go to Lincoln, The 930 says "Lin Clone"  a minor problem since the Magellan just gave simple no name directions.I find, in a rougher ridding car, the buttons work. better than a touch screen, with a touch screen, you tend to hit the screen multiple times. There seems to be no true shut off for the GPS, if you leave it off for a few weeks, the batteries are dead. It also seems to not work well when you have low batteries and a hot car, something that happens when stooped and the GPS is still in the window. None of these things are deal breakers, The main reason I purchased the 930 was because of the on line map updates ( My Magellan stooped giving map updates in its 3 year) and the interstate lane display designators ( have not seen them yet, but it may be new yet to Omaha and Arizona. I have found that the TomTom works just fine, and as updates to the maps continue, it will get to the point of the Magellan 800 maps, not for roads but for store locations. The cell phone bluetooth connection works great found hotels and called and made reservations routing is easy, all I would really want was more accurate business locations on the map, and easier to understand voices to make it a 5 star unit. With the on line conncection and continus updates, this will happen. for now, it is a 4 star unit.

$REVIEW.: I was impressed but this board for its sheer performance even with a lower end 965 black. It made that processor run like the day i bought it. It was out performing 6 core systems i had on the desk. Hooked it up with 8 core and its smoking. This board can handle a lot and it handles it with ease. The company was awesomely fast and it arrived in mint condition although the box needed a bit of work. I would recommend this board to everyone wanting to move into the 8 core category. If this thing can take the beating i give it at what i do it will certainly do well for you. Just so you know I'm a meteorologist and a atmospheric phenomena specialist. I study stuff that will eat a computer alive and this board rocks it like yesterdays news.

$REVIEW.: After a while, I get tired of the reoccurring fees that service providers like Time Warner charge.  When they doubled the fee this year for the modem that I have more than paid for over the passed years, I took the opportunity to purchase a unit of my own.  This way I will have the modem paid for in under a years rental rate.  That said, this unit connected easily with the help of a technician at Time Warner.  Giving him my MAC address and waiting for the network to sync up was all I had to do to make the change.  Well, almost.  I had to stand in line at Time Warner to return their old unit.  A really long line and on a Saturday morning no less.

$review_text.: I purchased this directly from foscam.us in hopes of getting better support (according to some other reviews). Ended up not needing it. This camera has good features at a good price point. Wireless connection, remote monitoring, alert triggers, relatively easy setup (if you have some experience with networks). But the picture QUALITY is absolute crap. A 6 year old cell phone has better video quality. One feature that is REALLY needed is automatic brightness control. When you set the brightness/contrast on a cloudy day, when the sun comes out the picture blooms so much you can't see anything (outdoor). Nighttime viewing (where image sharpness is always lacking), is OK. The IR light source does have good "throw" and illuminates a good distance. This camera would be adequate for indoor use, but for outdoors, it's seriously lacking in features and image quality.

$review_text.: I don't like writing negative reviews, but thought I need to at least post a potential problem for anyone buying this.  If you own a Vizio soundbar, you might not want to buy it, as the remote for this box totally conflicts with the Vizio soundbar.  This causes major problems because the commands are totally different for both.  For example pushing volume up on the Vizio will cause the Pivos to fast forward the video.Also the user interface needs a lot of work in my opinion.  I know one of the screenshots shows it having large movie thumbnails, but that is misleading because you can't set that as a default view.  The regular thumbnails are way too small.  I think they plan on changing that, but they still haven't since I bought it, so I returned it.  I would have never purchased it in the first place had I known that, I felt misled by the pictures. It also crashes the player if you try to continue a video where you left off.  The WD TV Live Streaming player I have now is much more polished in the user interface, features, and being configurable.Of course if they change it by the time someone reads this, just remember I posted this before they changed anything.

Both bands showed increased performance, so I am happy with the purchase. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is this should be included with a $200 router if it increases performance like this seems to do. Also it did take a few weeks for me to get it after ordering it but that isn't Amazon's fault.

$review_text.: These albums are attractively designed

The clear plastic that covers each page is rather glossy, which means you have tilt the album until you find an angle where you're not seeing the lights reflecting in it so you can see the photos

This 200-photo (4-up) version doesn't seem to have the serious flaw that the 300-photo (6-up) version does
On those larger albums, the plastic over the photos is wrinkled and the wrinkly reflections make it hard to see the photos

But my sample size is just a few of each size, so I can't be sure that these 200-photo albums are all OK

This size does seem less prone to quality control problems than the larger size.

$REVIEW.: Purchased this set 2 months ago with some hesitation at first. I was nervous about all the reviews of Plasma's with "bussing" sounds. I was also nervous about the warnings of "screen burn in". I had just purchased a Samsung 46" Lcd just a month prior and LOVED it!!! So this was a change in direction...The set is amazing, the picture is phoenomenal, the set up and user guide is simple and easy to follow, you will not be disappointed! Running an HD cable box to it plus Apple Tv 2 with sound output to a Denon AVR receiver. Although teh sound from the TV is so good we haven't used the amp at all except for music through Apple TV. I don't know where all the bad sound reviews come from?? We use this set in our large living room with a lot of glass for sunlight and have experienced little reflection from the screen....although it is apparent, it hasn't deterred the viewing. We also have a dedicated theater room with a 10' wide screen and HD projector and now we find ourselves in front of this new Plasma set daily. The picture is awesome!!!One sidenote...the stand is nice but it does not swivel!!! We were trying to swivel it and it wouldn't budge. Went online with Samsung support and they were adamant that it would swivel and we wouldn't break anything but it wouldn't friggin budge! Took it apart today and there is NO WAY this will swivel so be prepared just in case.Great set, great purchase....now....just received today another Samsung 50" Plasma 3d set, PN50c650...I hope it is as good as the last 2. This one is going in the workout/playroom and it is replacing a 60" hitachi rear projection.

Very happy for tiny item w a punch.  Nice little speaker.  I think I could present a projected item in a not-too-big room and folks would hear it well enough.  For the size, that's pretty impressive.Edit:  I had to come back and drop my rating.  The first speaker I got I gave to a friend's daughter.  It came apart.  Was she rough on it.  I think not but am not sure.  Took it apart and the speaker part had come loose, bounced around inside, cannot be easily reattached, and makes the speaker useless and weak and static prone, and unable to shut.  Darn, I love it, and now I am sad to lose it (gave her my newer one, but not willing to get another).

The 3ft cord is a nice length, not to long and if I want to keep what I have plugged in fairly close to the computer, but don't have to keep it right next to my compute. The 6ft is nice if what I have plugged needs to be a bit further away from the computer, I can set whatever on a near by table. The each fit well on each side, not to loose or tight, yet will not fall off. They each work very well, and I would recommend these if you are looking for such a cable.

$REVIEW.: I've had a garmin unit on my laptop for quite a while. The laptop was great. It could find anything anywhere and really take you through some off the wall places if you wanted a direct fastest route. Be prepared to use dirt roads!Obviously a laptop in a car is a real pain even though you get a huge map. But the 360 screen is... well not as bad as you would think. But the 360 leaves much to be desired, comparitively. To be honest, I'm quite disappointed with this unit.The problem for me is, driving by a sams club, for instance, you type in sams club and... nearest one is about 150 miles away. When you know there are a few within a 50 mile radius. Same with dunkin donuts. It makes me wonder what else it's missing. The laptop finds them all. I don't know if it's that the laptop has so much more room for details or what. But the 360 is certainly no where near as accurate.Still, it will get you where you're going but don't expect to see everything you can on the way.

$REVIEW.: This has a very clever design to keep it compact.  I don't think that it works as well as a larger UHF antenna, but it isn't as ugly.  AND, you might be able to use it indoors if you need to.Note that this is a UHF antenna, so don't expect VHF reception.I bought this to replace a larger UHF/VHF antenna that had been damaged by the weather.  It is nicer looking by far, but does not perform better.  I'm not sure that I'd buy it again.  However I did get mine for a bargain price, comparable to a typical rooftop antenna.The directions are not good.  Not terrible, but not good.  They need improvement.

$review_text.: I bought this modem to avoid the monthly rental fee that Comcast charges for their own cable modems


After roughly a year, this modem will pay for itself

In my market, I am charged $8/month to rent a modem from Comcast.Installation was very easy

I unplugged my existing modem and plugged this one in
I then called Comcast and told them I bought a new modem


They asked for the MAC address and switched my account to the new modem


The call took about 15 minutes and was very easy.One of the nice things about this modem is it has very detailed status and diagnostic information
If you start to experience issues with signal strength from the cable company, you can use this to diagnose the issue on your own
It also has a theoretical top speed of 343 Mbps
So this modem should last you for a long time.If there's one thing to complain about, it's that the LEDs on the front of the modem are a little too bright

The bottom light is always blinking


So if you're very close to the modem or in a dark room, it may be noticeable.

$REVIEW.: This lens is really good for the money and takes exceptionally clear photos, but there are a few quirks that users probably need to be aware of.First of all, the 2.8 "fixed" aperture will not exactly work for every Nikon camera.  I am using a D7000.  I am unable to manually lock the aperture in the lowest 2.8 setting.  The lowest I can go is around 3.3.  The lens also appears to have a manual setting of 2.8 thru 20 on the lens ring, but manual aperture settings will not work on most Nikons.  You must have a professional grade body for this to work... something along the lines of a D700 or D800 (please research this for yourself before buying). If you're like me and have a "better than average" Nikon, simply set the aperture in 2.8, otherwise you're camera will register an error.Secondly, this is a Macro lens (as advertised).  It sets everything to 100 mm (again as advertised) which is about 2x zoom of what the normal eye will usually see.  It also works great for portrait shots as well, but do not expect the auto focus motor to zip into action and focus on the first try.  It's a little slow, and it has some trouble focusing in low light situations.  I actually found that the manual setting is a little easier to work with and quite frankly a little more fun.  This is making me a better photographer.Lastly, as others have already suggested in other reviews, switching the lens from AF (Auto Focus) to MF (Manual Focus) is a little strange at first... it is this push pull action on the end of the barrel.  Once you get used to it, it really isn't that bad, but it does make a click... so be careful not to frighten off your subject if switching between MF and AF when you are "up close".All in all, I am very happy with this lens.  For the price, it does an exceedingly great job.  My test photos are very crisp and clear.  Zooming in (using the camera's zoom or Photoshop) produces a very clear picture with great detail.  If you don't have a ton of money to spend on a lens... this is one that you will probably like.

The diagram above the switch shows a locked padlock for off, and an unlocked padlock for on. Anyway, for the price, I'm not going to complain. I can adjust the volume with the MP3 player, which gives out enough sound anyway. It does sound good and is definitely better than earphones when watching a movie on the laptop.

$review_text.: This is a good quality 10ft cable that I frequently use when the standard 6ft power cables (that usually come with computer equipment) are just not long enough.I particularly like to use these to wrap a few coils of extra cable behind a desk

 That way, when it's time to pull the computer out for basic cleaning, maintenance, and testing, its easy to do so without unplugging it

 A plastic coated clothes hanger can be made into a spring coil to strap onto the cable to give the coil shape and assist in keeping it untangled.If you do find yourself having to go deeper inside the box, just be careful to unplug the cord from the power supply at the back of the computer to prevent live current hazards while you are inside.

I am using them with full 1080p and audio. I haven't tried them with 3D yet.Physically, their construction seems very solid. The connector molding seems to be well built and durable. It is ergonomically comfortable to hold and plug and/or unplug. I like very much the mesh finish. It gives the cable protection along its length as well as making it &#34;almost impossible&#34; to tangle with itself.I definitely would recommend this to a friend. I would probably replace my parent's HDMI cables with this product.The only negative aspect that I will be monitoring is the effect of the weight of the cable on the HDMI connector. Some TVs and cable boxes (especially the ones used by Comcast/Xfinity down here) have very flimsy HDMI connections. This cable is heavy on the tip, so be careful when you install it not to allow the cable to be pulled down by gravity causing stress on the device's connection. Use a velcro tie or just a wire tie to hold the cable to something (your TV back, mounting frame or other cable passing by) in order to relief the strain on the HDMI connector.

I put my wives 11 inch netbook and then put my sons 15 inch Dell inside of it after I took the netbook out and both were swallowed up by the compartment.  Lots of room which is nice.  It can hold a lot of other stuff as well.

$REVIEW.: Very happy with this. The BIOS on these boards has everything you need to OC, but is still extremely easy to navigate and use; it's a definite improvement over what boards were offering even a few years ago.Installation is easy as well. I used an i7-3770 with a Coolermaster Hyper 212 EVO cooler, and there's plenty of clearance around the socket area for the larger cooler without any worries as to the install. I did not install the optional aux fans for the chipset and backplate vent on the motherboard, but the option to do this if temperatures aren't to my liking is a nice touch (it didn't seem necessary since I have no immediate plans to overclock anything).The good:It looks great, it's solid and sturdy in both looks and feel. Is the thermal armor necessary? Probably not, but it sure looks good and contributes to a nice clean build. If it helps with dust and longevity in my house full of cat hair, then it was worth the money.Ports are all clearly labeled on the motherboard; be sure to check the CPU fan port when plugging it in as complaints of CPU fan alarms seem to be common with the board. I ran into the same thing, not realizing that I plugged it in to an aux port where the CPU fan primary plug is normally located...so while it worked fine, it wasn't monitored on the right port at first. Check the labeling like I didn't and you'll be good...probably a good idea to set any unused ports to ignore in the BIOS after startup as well so you don't see alarms in AISuite for fans you don't have.Speaking of AI Suite, the monitoring software is nice. Easy to use, easy to read, and has the utilities and everything you need right there for both monitoring and updating. Tools like this tend to be a pain or have issues you need to deal with, but I actually like this one. I was running it on a P67 board prior to this build, but the Sabertooth has its own Thermal Radar feature you can look at that will show temperature zones all over the board.More 6G SATA ports. Still not packed with them, but having 2 primary and a separate controller for 2 more gives plenty of space for this. They're clearly marked on the board and easily accessible for plugs.The bad:The 3GB USB internal port wouldn't accept the 20p header from my case (Thermaltake GT 10). It's hard to see the pins on it since it's side mounted rather than vertical, but either it's a tighter fit than it should be or there was a bent pin that I couldn't see. No stars off because I'm honestly not sure if this was the port or with the header connector in my case... it wasn't vital for me so I just left it.Onboard sound is not bad at all for built-in, but it will only output 2-channel over optical to my receiver (depending on the content). Wound up buying a PCI-E sound card to replace it. For people with analog speakers, though, the onboard sound is surprisingly good. It's nothing a cheap sound card can't fix, but it would have been nice for the onboard. The software is a little anemic, don't expect a range of options from the realtek audio manager.Bottom line:I like Asus boards, and this one is a keeper. Their guys are present on forums and boards to help with issues and give updates, the boards themselves are feature-rich and stable, and I don't buy anything else anymore.*9/4/12 edit: After a few days of working with the board, it became apparent that the optional fans that come with the board aren't really optional. The Thermal Radar was showing some extremely hot areas on the board, especially at USB 3 and PCI-E 1 (the PCIE1 slot area was throwing thermal warnings after a short gaming session). After installation of the fans, no more issue.Not something worth dinging the board for, but it did make me wonder why they don't come pre-installed since they weren't optional even on a very clean build in a case with a serious amount of airflow already installed. Be sure to install them before putting the motherboard into the case, unlike me, and you'll save yourself a headache.

$review_text.: It works great on my tx2-1274dx. My old battery died and with this one, I get about 3.5 hours of runtime. However, it does stick out the back about an inch which doesn't sound like a lot, but once you put it in your laptop, it seems a lot larger. The original I had stuck out about half an inch and this one appears significantly bigger. New, batterybar showed 59443 mWh and this hasn't dropped in two months. I can finally use my tablet w/o plugging it in every 10 mins!Update 4/29: Just noticed that the AC adapter gets pretty hot. Maybe it did before as well, but it seems this battery takes a while to charge up and this leads to excessive heating. This is all speculation so I'm not 100% if this is a problem with my adapter/my usage.

Also I put a large reflector inside and put a small reflector outside of the bag. All fit well in this small bag. I could put one more extra lens if it's not big zoom lens.

$REVIEW.: This case has a few flaws which in my opinion are pretty substantial-1) The little protective flap that covers the 3.55mm headphone input doesn't sit flush like the rest of the little protective flaps do.  I don't know if the designers intended for it to be this way or not, but it kind of just loosely flops over the input and looks like s*&%!  I took a razor blade to the ugly little floppy flap.2) The case, like every Otterbox case I've seen, consists of different pieces of rubber and plastic.  This case has an outer lining made of thin rubber.  It takes some time working the rubber lining into all the little grooves and making everything nice and flush.  The problem is that there aren't any grooves for the narrow piece of the rubber lining that goes around the speaker opening at the bottom of the iPad and it doesn't sit flush, it just kind of loosely hangs there.  I put a few drops of super glue to hold it more firmly in place.That being said, now that I've chopped up and jerry-rigged this case, I do like it.  It's a good looking case which seems to provide good protection.  I also like the cover/stand, although it doesn't snap to the back of the case like it should.  I can't give it more than 3 stars because you shouldn't have to bust out a knife and glue when you're spending $50-$100 on an Otterbox.  C'mon guys

On top of the price for the Seagate Backup Plus Desktop Thunderbolt Adapter (STAE129) you'll need a cable which will set you back another $30-40.

$review_text.: I recently purchased this product to enhance the sound in my wife's Chevy Aveo5 with the standard factory system.Product arrived in about 2 days using Amazon Prime shipping. Unit is heavier than I expected and external build quality is good. The installation went smoothly. I have it mounted under the driver's seat (in a small hatchback space is premium).The user manual could be more user friendly, but once adjusted it filled out the bottom end really well. This is a really good small Subwoofer. The total wattage in the specs maybe misleading as this will not win any Bass wars, but it was not design to.So if you are looking to fill out the bottom end with your factory stereo, give this sub at look.
$SUMMARY.: Boss Audio BASS600 - Great addition for the price

$REVIEW.: Okay, the tripod is pretty pathetic. But the telescope itself is really quite good: super lightweight, excellent optics, smooth mechanically. For $55, you aren't going to find a better package. And, just based on the maxim The Best Telescope Is The One You Most Often Use, the Travel Scope 70 if maybe not literally "the best" 'scope is nonetheless one you will use often, just because it is SO easy to use, and once at the eyepiece, you will find the images sharp and contrasty, as per any good refractor, and the little tube easy to move every which way around the heavens above.Even those of you who (like me) have a number of larger scopes will still find yourself "one-handing" this baby out to the backyard for those nights that are iffy, meaning you might have just 20 minutes between cloud cover, or those nights when you just want to go out for a half hour or so and don't want to have to haul out/setup/break down/haul back in he big gun.I mean, tripod and all we are talking under 5 pounds total here.For wide field viewing of open clusters or Milky Way star clouds, you can't do much better even at 3-4x the cost. The moon comes through with admirable detail and contrast, and even Jupiter and Saturn are . . . not bad at all, though the images are small. M45, the Pleaides, are borderline spectacular in this scope; the TS 70 is sort of like having astro binoculars but with multiple magnification options and greater stability. The two included eyepieces are decent, though higher quality oculars will improve performance. But for casual observing the included 20 and 10 mms are at least adequate. In my experience, this scope handles up to about 50x magnification well; after that, image quality begins to degrade a bit.Now as for the tripod. Fully extended it is, as other reviewers have pointed out, wobbly to the point of being nearly unusable.But if you keep it fully compacted and use it as a table top mount (on a backyard patio table, picnic table at a park, etc) it is reasonably stable. But a better solution would be to get a more solid tripod, such as the Dolica st-500 for under $25. I have this tripod and in concert with the TS 70, it's a remarkably good setup. Paired with this tripod, the TS 70 becomes a 5-star performer. These two are a pretty much perfect combo. And as the Dolica breaks down to about 24", and comes with its own carry case, you still have a super transportable package to cart off to some darker skies site.Dolica ST 500 68 Inch Lightweight TripodDolica ST-500 68-Inch Lightweight Tripod]]

$REVIEW.: I bought three of these back in August for a set of vtech cordless phones.  The first couple of charges didn't seem to hold very long and I thought I wasted my money, but within the first week the charges started lasting longer.  I thought I charged them long enough the first time, so I don't know why it happened like that, but now they work very well.  I regularly leave my phones off the charger for a few days and yet I still find a phone with power floating around the house.  Definitely worth the price.

Using the Targus Lap Lounge for my the IPAD, has been great.The IPAD sits securely on the Lap Lounge and at a great angle which makes it easy to use.  My hands rest comfortably on the lounge and when I use it nothing is strained.  It is light and easy to set aside when the need arises. I can easily hold it in one hand as I get up and down.  It is comfortable, light and stable.  It is small and easy to store when not being used.

$review_text.: I have tried out a lot of different coolers for my laptop (13" Macbook)


My laptop tends to get hot enough to fry eggs if I run anything like Minecraft on it

This cooler is light and easy to take with me in my bag and dead silent, quieter than even my laptops internal fan
The repositionable fans are fast and easy to relocate to your laptops hot spots
It keeps my laptop in a comfortable usage angle too

For such a reasonable price you really can't go wrong
I did have to order a replacement unit as one of the two fans on the first one had a bad bearing in it that made it run a bit under speed and hummed


I haven't had any problem with the new one yet, not a sound from it, I had to double check to make sure it was even running.Pros:-Dead silent-Lightweight-Effective cooling-Moveable fans-USB power plug has a input right on it so you don't have to give up your port for the fans-Good priceCons:-Only problem I have had is the replacement I had to order because of the bearing that was bad.Highly recommended overall, I will probably be ordering an extra one for my girlfriends laptop shortly.

$REVIEW.: I wanted to split the output from a cable box to my TV and PC monitor. I did not want to have both on simultaneously. The TV (Samsung) did not work if the cable from the PC monitor was plugged into the splitter and even when PC monitor was set on DVI. It only worked when the PC monitor was turned off. The PC monitor rec'd a choppy signal if the TV was plugged into the splitter even with the TV turned off. It may be that a boost is req'd even if only one item is turned on simply b/c it is plugged in. This splitter did not work. Other reviews pointed it out but I thought b/c I was not using both at once I'd be fine. Just having it plugged in made one unit a no go.

I unscrewed the cover to see if a wire was loose to find there were no loose wires which can only mean that one of the 3 wires broke inside the black insulator which feels more like a rubber band than a protective insulator. I would advise to go with a name brand (i.e. Canon) or go wireless.

$REVIEW.: It's nice that this Sony RDPX500iP will charge your iPad, iPhone, or iPod

 We use it all the time for to conveniently charge our gadgets, but do note that the iPad cannot be docked in a horizontal position like you can with some other docks, like the OnBeat from JBL
 We have the RDPX500iP in the living room so we can play podcasts, spotify, and iTunes music for all of us to enjoy

 The sound, is okay, but not stellar


 I believe we get better sound and convenience from our Airplay JBL OnBeat unit.

 The Sony is very heavy and can't really be considered portable


 I would think for all of the weight that the sound would be amazing across a broad range

 The louder it is played, the more muffled it seems to be
 Also, the unit is covered largely in a typical speaker fabric
 While it looks okay (maybe a bit dated), the use of so much thin fabric makes it susceptible to damage, and also means it collects lots of dust


 Considering the price, sound quality, weight, and relativley old fashioned speaker fabric, be sure to shop around and consider all of the docking options.

$SUMMARY.: Pretty good sound for the price, maybe a bit muffled.

$review_text.: On 8 Oct 2011, I received a Jawbone Jambox Bluetooth speaker as a gift, which my husband purchased for me on 6 Oct 2011 from Amazon.  It was a great product, with good sound clarity.  I was very impressed with the speaker's range and capabilities, although I did feel the usability left a few things to be desired.  However, I had a problem in that it didn't seem to hold a charge.  I contacted Jawbone's support via e-mail (form on their website) on 29 Nov 2011 for assistance.  Unlike many other support services, their agent seemed to be truly reading my e-mails and not just scanning for keywords and sending form responses.  However, once we got to the point that we determined an RMA was in order, support informed me that they were "out of stock" and couldn't promise when they'd have a replacement unit in stock.  They said I could send my unit in but they couldn't tell me when I'd get a replacement.  They could not even give me a range, e.g., 4-6 weeks, 2-3 months.However, at the same time as they were telling me they were out of stock and could make no promises, they were selling my exact model on their website  with indication that they are "in stock", so the claims of being out of stock ring false.  When I pointed this out to the support representative, he provided no explanation for the discrepancy but instead continued to say they were out of stock.  He recommended I continue to "check in with them" periodically to see if a replacement was available.  I asked if, per their stated Warranty, if they could offer a refund since a replacement or repair seemed to be unavailable.  Unsurprisingly, they declined that option.This feels to me very much like an attempt to get out of honoring the warranty by putting the consumer off and/or making it so unappealing as to discourage pursuit of the warranty.  At best, I suspect that they're simply "out of stock" of replacement units, i.e., re-furbished units, even though the warranty says replacement will be either new or re-furb and not limited to re-furbished units.  I don't think that it's honoring the spirit of the warranty to delay replacement on that basis.  I further think it's against the spirit if not the actual wording of the warranty to refuse to replace a faulty unit in any way when the unit failed in less than 60 days from the point of purchase.  Finally, I think it's beyond the sense of reason to tell a customer with a ~$200 product that is now a paperweight that it's up to them to keep contacting you periodically to find out when the warranty will be honored.  Admittedly, I've been lucky enough to not have very many issues requiring warranty service with my other electronics, but when I have, I have never run into this sort of shenanigan.After this, there is no way I will spend money with them again, and I advise others to do the same.  It may be within Jawbone's legal right to handle warranty requests in this way, but I think it shows an unwillingness to stand behind the quality of the product as well as a lack of caring about their customers once the sale is complete.  As for my specific situation, I'm basically out of luck.  I'm past the return window (30 days) to return it to Amazon.  I'm not the only person who has run into this battery issue, and I wouldn't be surprised if that was part of the cause of their "out of stock" issue on replacement units.  Buy at your own risk, because you may or may not ever be able to get Jawbone to actually honor their warranty.Edited 12/3/2012:  Jawbone sent a replacement (which seems to be a new unit) on 11/20/2012 (more than a year after this review), which I received on 11/23/2012.  So far, it is working fine, and I will update again after a few more weeks with status as to whether it outlasts the previous unit.  I posted more details about my email exchange with Jawbone in the comments on this review, but the most notable aspect is that Jawbone claims to have improved their warranty handling but did not make any specific commitments to a) honor warranty requests or b) ensure in-stock units in reasonable timeframes in the future.  While my specific issue has been resolved by this replacement, I don't know that I feel right saying that others should feel fine ordering this product given how long it took to get a response and that the response (both below and in the exchanges in the comment thread on this post) was non-committal as far as how other people's issues might be handled.

$REVIEW.: I waited several months before reviewing this hard disk. I can certainly say that baring a defected product, this Seagate barracuda 6 GB/s hard drive with 64MB cache performs very well.Some thoughts:* While it may not be as fast as my solid state drive, it still is great for storing games, movies, music, and other files. I compared this hard disk to myIntel 320 Series 80 GB SATA 3.0 Gb-s 2.5-Inch Solid-State Driveand my results showed that this Seagate hard disk is comparable with a sequential read of 178 MB/s and 164 MB/s write speed. My Intel 320 SSD had got sequential read of 223 MB/s, but a 93 MB/s write speed. It's nowhere close to a SSD for larger files, but it's a good alternative.* Very reliable so far. I waited about 3 months to see how well it holds up. No hiccups, crashes, anything so far.Unfortunately, defects are bound to happen. In my case, mine was not defected and this hard disk has done well for loading games, music, and other files (large and small). With the construction and internal design of this hard disk, it stays very cool and quiet.  A good choice, when placed toe to toe with Western Digital. A solid and reliable hard drive so far.P.S. As a reminder, if you haven't done so already or haven't in a while, make sure your computer case is clean. The excess dust and hence heat that you remove from your case can help maintain a ventilated and clean space for your hard disk.

$review_text.: I love these eneloop batteries! They come pre-charged, so you can start using them right away. They can be re-charged in any NiMH recharger, because they are NiMH batteries at the core. Yet, they can hold a charge for a long, long time, many years, even longer than alkalines. Like all NiMH batteries their output voltage is 1.2V, which is sufficient for most applications, such as digital cameras that still take AA batteries; a few Canon models do, and they make great glove compartment cameras for emergency and non-emergency situations. The 1900 mAh output rating is for minimal output, often you get 2000 or close to that, this means it can power your devices for a decent amount of time, obviously depending on the actual device and its power draw. These are also environmentally friendly!

$review_text.: I think these put out very clean, clear and wide range sound.  They sound best at low to medium volume. Listening to a symphony I could hear the individual instruments better than on other speakers I have. I've heard more "pleasing" sound, but think these are amazing for such small speakers.There is a bass port in the back of each, I hear the bass better if I keep them away from the wall.2 connection wire pairs are included, about 6 feet long, black&red; so it's easy to keep + and - straight. They look like 22 AWG to me. Adequate for low amperage, but definitely not monster cable.Can connect with bare wire or banana plugs.

After working for 3 months one day i started to hear a continous beeping from my UPS
When i checked the status, the error reported was that the battery failed


I've started to use the second battery and its working for now but i'm not going to hold my breath

It arrived quickly, installed easily just like the original, charged up and worked great; haven't had a single issue with it in the last ~6 months.  The fit isn't as good as an original apple battery and seems to hold slightly less charge, but for the cost, it is a great deal.

I hooked it up using a digital coaxial cable with no installation problems. The sound is really quite nice, however the bass is a bit lacking (the subwoofer does not have a separate power source). If you can live without booming bass, this inexpensive soundbar is a great option if you are cost-concious consumer.

$REVIEW.: The only complaint that I have about this product is one of the spindles broke open during transit

 I feel the company should have used a different shipment method such as UPS
They instead used the USPS or snail mail and well we all know how they deliver


The product itself is a great buy and so far I have not had any coasters as long as I burn the disks at half the write speed
 Will use again in the future if the need arises
Also had a problem getting the container which wasn't broken open.There is an arrow at the top of the container which shows open and close
If you have old eyes like me it is very hard to see

 My son had to come over and figure it out


 You have to keep unscrewing the top half of the spindle then the package opens

 It took about 6 or 8 turns in the direction of the arrow which points to open


there are about 5 plastic disk protectors on top


 This is done I guess to ensure there is no damage to the property.

$review_text.: Clearly not something a man would want unless that man has a passion for hot pink, this Kindle HD cover plays on the latest fashion craze of duct tape chic. It has a textured vinyl finish that mimics the ridges and inconsistencies of randomly arranged strips of duct tape. This is the obvious.The hidden part is its soft and cozy interior which is a cross between suede and a high grade felt. It is soft to the touch and offers the Kindle's surface areas substantial padding with a snappy closure that snaps shut when closed.The Kindle itself is fastened by elastic bands on all four interior corners. It seems fairly secure and when open this functions as a book.Overall, this is a nice cover. It's perfect for a young person or anyone who loves a bright pink. What keeps it from a 5* rating is its price. Given its synthetic composition, it is overpriced at around $40.

It comes with a blue LED that lets you know that it properly received the remote control signal


I found it to be very bright (a little too bright) so I hid it and found that I don't need it anyway
I was concerned about interference from the plasma tv and there was none
I have the sensor mounted behind the plasma and it is plenty sensitive
I just point the remote in the general vicinity of the tv and it works perfectly! So glad I didn't drop hundreds of dollars on a "plasma proof" system.On a side note, I also used 50' $39 HDMI cables and those worked fine as well

Don't waste your money on the very expensive ones because there is no difference.

$review_text.: I looked high and low for the smallest belt pouch style bag I could find for my newly purchased NEX-3N with 16-50mm Power Zoom lens.  Everything I either had (and I have a LOT of camera bags) was either too large or too small, or just bulky, due to the wrong shape for this camera.  Well, the Dashpoint 20 is the PERFECT bag for someone who wants to carry their smaller Sony NEX APS-C sensor mirrorless camera as though it was a point-and-shoot.  This way, in the warmer weather I don't have to drop my Sony in a coat or jacket pocket and have it bang around against everything I come into contact with.  This nicely padded snug fitting case is just the ticket for belt carry, or attaching to a wide luggage or camera bag strap.  Very versatile.Just a note:  Initially, the fit was too snug, but after realizing that the "hook-and-loop" strap attachment tabs on the back of the case were snugged up a big too much when purchased I merely relaxed the tension a bit and gained just enough room to easily slide the Sony into and out of this bag with ease.  It is now as if custom made for my Sony NEX-3N!

You just wipe down the screen with the cloth provided, which does wonders on getting rid of fingerprints quickly, then use the dust removal tape to get all the dust and fuzz and hairs and whatever else might be floating around your house off the screen, then peel back the top, align it, and slowly put it on. Use the card to remove the bubbles (which come out so incredibly easy) and  voila!One of the best experiences with screen protectors I've ever had!

$review_text.: The Caselogic "XNTM-4 Messenger eSling" is a well made and good looking case, but is NOT suitable for laptops other than the smallest ultra-portable or NetBooks. That being said, this is a great case for most of my other electronic and miscellaneous gear. My DayTimer Planner, Kindle 2, DS game, Flip Ultra, point & shoot camera, business cards, check book, and various office supplies fit very comfortably.The case is fairly compact and carries nicely on the shoulder. The adjustable strap is sturdy and looks like it will hold up well with use, but it is not padded so I will not pack the case too heavy if it is going to be carried for a long time. The strap material is textured, so it isn't prone to slipping like I expected it to be.The front flap is secured by two fairly powerful magnet catches that holds it firmly closed, yet is easy to quickly open. While it hasn't accidentally come open yet it really wouldn't be a problem since the 3 interior compartments can be closed, one with Velcro and two are zippered.One of my favorite features of the case is that the compartment linings are not black, being either gray or maroon. This makes finding things in the bottom much easier than in all of my other cases. I really hope that this idea is adopted by other manufacturers!There are five main compartments and several smaller interior compartments for pens, business cards, etc. There really isn't much in the way of padding, except two thick strips in the larger back compartment to protect whatever device you can squeeze in it, so I don't pack anything fragile in the outer compartments.Overall, this is a quality case and a good value for the price.Recommended!CFH

I have remote base phones - plug in the earpiece - put the phone in my shirt pocket and can wander around with my hands free. Callers can't tell the difference between the phone and the earpiece. Complaints from the other end - apparently, the mic is very sensitive - munching snacks creates a crashing sound in the ears on the other end of the line.This is my third set. Number one went dead in two weeks and was exchanged. After two years, the rubber? cushion that fits into the ear disintegrated and the wire covering emerging from the jack deteriorated, exposing bare wire. I expect the same from this one. After all, it is Un-American not to participate, enthusiastically, in our throw away culture. Be happy, consume more.

I was looking for a 49mm quality filter for my x100 and I saw this with the filter and battery as a package and I just ordered it.It comes with two films, they aren't flimsy and they are packaged well with a giant micro fiber cloth as well as two sticky strips for dust and lint removal.Installation was very easy and I even screwed up the alignment the first time but, was able to peel it up and re apply it without getting bubbles or lint under it.The film has an oleophobic coating on it which resists oils so fingerprints and face juice won't stick to it as easily and it cleans off without much fuss.The film is pretty clear, although I can tell it's removing some contrast from the screen its on... but really its not a big deal.

$REVIEW.: I recently bought this lens for a Nikon D90 camera


 I am new to Macro Photography and chose this lens over the Nikon 85mm
 At first I had trouble taking macro pictures with the lens

 I know you are supposed to use a tripod, but right now that's just not my style

 Finding a way to put a tripod in front of a flower and trying to catch the bee in the act just doesn't appeal to me


 My pictures at first were blurry


 My shutter speed was too low to hand hold the shots

 After giving the shutter more speed I solved that problem
 Now my pictures are just as nice and clear
 The lens works well with my Nikon D90


 It doesn't make any noise at all and is very snappy to lock in when I use auto focus

 It doesn't hunt at all

 I did find that in taking pictures of things close up it is easier to take the pictures in manual focus

 Focusing in manual is real easy with this lens


 The picture quality is fabulous!  I just love this lens!!!!!  I posted a link to some of my pictures in the comments section.

It's just that simple.I have no negative comments for this audio card, it works just great. Highly recommend it.

$REVIEW.: We got this unit bundled with a VIERA 3D TV.  One of the main purposes for our purchase was to edit and watch videos of our twins, including 3D video shot with the Fuji W3.  In the past I have used Pinnacle Studio Ultimate to edit video but have recently switched to Magix Movie Edit Pro 17 because of it's capability to edit 3D footage. (very pleased with that program so far, btw).Unfortunately, this Panasonic player does not play any of the animated menus rendered by either of these software programs.  Unless I use the most basic of menus, a black screen is presented.  These menus each default to the "play movie" button and the odd thing is that this functionality works.  In other words, the menu loads, displaying a black screen, but pressing "ok" on the player remote engages the button, causing the movie to play, which plays fine.The key pieces of the puzzle are that the firmware on both the TV and Blu-Ray player are up-to-date and the menu plays properly in every other Blu-Ray device we have played it in (including Cyberlink PowerDVD player and two different Samsung Blu-Ray models).Despite this evidence and three hours of emails and phone technical support, Panasonic has thus far insisted they cannot guarantee their player will work with home made Blu-Rays (even if they meet proper specifications).  Their only offer has been to replace it with a refurbished model, which I'm skeptical would make any difference since this appears to be a firmware issue.In addition, dealing with their customer service has been a nightmare.  Their email support apparently isn't connected with their telephone support as the people I've talked with on the phone never have knowledge of the emails that have occurred.  In addition, each time I've spoken with them on the phone, I've had to repeat the entire situation, despite them having all of it in their records. (i.e. they asked me the same troubleshooting questions the second time I contacted them as they did the first time).At this point I've asked that they either agree to have me send some discs so that they can further investigate the issue or offer a refund so that we can purchase a different brand player that works.  I'm still awaiting resolution.UPDATE 17 July 2011 - I've made a few more calls to Panasonic including talking with "supervisors".  Each time it's taken me at least 10 minutes to get to someone going through their awful "front lines" of support.  They are continuing to hold fast to their "we can't provide support for home made discs" policy, despite the disc working in every other brand of player I've ever put it in.  If you wish to create home made HD/Blu-Ray discs I strongly advise that you consider a different brand.UPDATE 23 April 2012 - Somewhere along the line I was able to get another in road with Panasonic's customer support and they agreed to investigate this further.  I sent them one of the discs that wasn't working.  About three months later, they finally got back to me and revealed that the menus had PAL video embedded in them.  They suggested that their products were more strict when it came to following standards which would explain why the discs would play in other brands.  I took this information back to the manufacturers ofMovie Edit Pro 17 Plusand this time, they took the time to verify that the error was on their end. (they had denied any issue on their end months prior).  You can read more about that adventure in my review of that product.I have bumped the review for this product back up to 3 stars since the "problem" wasn't actually with this product.  I can't bump it any further due to the fact that:  a) Other brands don't have this problem and  b) it still took me months to get this answer from their support team.

$REVIEW.: This tripod is about what you'd expect given the price. It works OK, though I feel that the design isn't as easy to use as more modern (and expensive) ones. Despite its claims of smooth panning, head movement is just plastic on plastic, so don't expect really fluid movements in your videos if that's what your using it for.Works well for photography, especially travel as it's pretty light, but it's not heavy enough to keep a big camera rock steady when it's fully extended. Bring along a remote shutter release and you should be just fine as long as it's not really windy.It's also nice that it includes two quick-release plates, but it's not nice that those plates are very bulky and prevent almost all cameras from sitting level on a table, so I don't leave mine attached. For me, that kills some of the appeal of quick-release in the first place.
$SUMMARY.: good for the money, light, reasonably compact, but not smooth head for video.

$REVIEW.: ...that the cables (as shown in the picture) are labelled on one end with a sticker marked "to the TV"; unlike normal HDMI cables, which can be plugged either way, these can only be plugged one way. I mistakenly plugged them the wrong way around thinking they would perform like any other HDMI cable and came to find out that unless you plug them the way they are labelled they do not work at all (I guess this is how they managed to make them thinner?). Anyway, as long as you plug them the way they are labelled you should be fine.

It would come and go, but was evident even when a DVD wasn't inserted, i.e., on the splash screen.Also, the component inputs were defective.  I tried them with three different component sources and all I could get was a green, grainy screen.  The HDMI input worked fine, but I really wanted to be able to use the component, since that's what my cable provider offers.  Frankly, I expected better of Toshiba.  I've got an ancient Toshiba tube TV which still works fine.  This LCD was a disappointment.  It went back.

$review_text.: My Thecus N4100Pro has for 1.5 years provided reliable network backup for servers on my LAN, no problems there


 I use it in RAID-5 plus one hot spare with WD5002ABYS drives, for simple manual backup, using the FTP service of the NAS for data transfer


 The administration utility runs in a browser, and it is a good one


 The web browser interface for downloading files from the NAS is too slow to take seriously, but a good graphical FTP client is better at that anyway.I've experienced two glitches in the life of the unit:1

The system fan failed after about 15 months


 The fan was easy to replace, but a fan should not fail that soon.2


When I upgraded the firmware from 3.xx.xx to 5.03.01, the upgrade caused network communications with the NAS to be lost
 To solve the problem I had to revert the unit to the factory network configuration before I was able to login and reconfigure the unit


 I had to reconfigure a lot more than just the network settings, but my RAID array was not altered by the firmware upgrade, and my data files were just fine.Bottom line:  It meets my simple need for network backup and has been reliable, but the firmware upgrade glitch in particular, even though I got through it, would cause me to look to a different brand for my next NAS purchase.

$review_text.: The pen is very good in capturing whatever you scribble on paper, once you align the receiver right. Other reviewers are correct about the thin paper capacity of the receiver clip, and I'd recommend sticking the receiver to a bigger paper clip on your own, to work with bigger notepads. As for the ink refills, you can get any micro-ball pen refills. I use 4C refill for Zebra tele-scopic pen, which I bought form Staples for $1.70/pack of 2, and you can find cheaper ones too (Steadler brand).My main annoyance with the pen is that the button on the receiver is very insensitive. I have to press very hard to turn the receiver on/off, or to flip the page. It makes me worry about the longevity of the device. Other than that, the pen is great in capturing text/diagrams on the fly. in addition, sometimes, and use it as drawing digipen, instead of a drawing pad, for making simple illustrations to go on power point slides.

$review_text.: I bought a pack of these sleeves to use when shooting outdoor sports in the rain. I'm not a pro photographer and couldn't justify the expense of the superior Aquatech rain gear. I needed something small and light that fits in my camera backpack and keeps me shooting during poor weather conditions I occasionally encounter.If you do a lot of shooting in questionable weather and can justify the $200 cost, the Aquatech is obviously a better solution. But for $6, the Op/Tech sleeves are hard to beat in a pinch, particularly for casual photographers.The sleeves are large enough to cover most all but the largest of the pro telephoto lenses. It fits my D300 with battery pack and 70-200 2.8 with room to spare. The sleeve has a hole in the rear - just remove your eyepiece cover, stretch the hole over the eyepiece, and replace the cover to hold it in place. The sleeve has a drawstring closure in front that holds very securely to the lens hood. The plastic is transparent and thin enough to allow operation of all the controls right through the sleeve (vs, sliding your hands up inside). It's a very usable solution, although it does make adjusting the zoom a bit more difficult. But again, this is intended to be more of an emergency or occasional rain solution.I've spent endless hours shooting football games in the rain and the protection provided is excellent. As long as you don't poke a hole in it, your equipment will stay dry. I'm able to reuse them multiple times.Pros: Very low cost, stores anywhere, excellent protection, low tech ease of use, able to see all of the camera's controls, works with tripods and monopods.Cons: Takes a few minutes to put on and get adjusted, makes accessing some controls a little awkward (but not impossible), far too long for short lenses.Bottom line: Excellent emergency protection during occasional bad weather for cameras with larger lenses. Those using smaller lenses should look for another solution.

My simply enabling sharing on my pc's movie folders (and those files on external drives connected to the PC via USB), the Boxee immediately found them and populated the Boxee movie library.  I think the remote could be better, but it is very responsive and simple.  In my case, I did have to rename some of my ISO files so that they were more similar to their IMDB entries. This was to make sure Boxee could identify the files and provide the right movie poster art during browsing.  All-in-all, I am very pleased and feel that I got a good value for the dollar.

Most of the time the low cost ports would not recognize the headsets, or the storage drives, or there would be conflicts

$REVIEW.: Had to come back and make a second update.  The break-in phase is a MUST.  But now, zero hiss.  These speakers are INCREDIBLE.  That is all.And to the person on here complaining of not much bass, i can see what you're talking about... you don't have them seated in your ear properly.  if they are just barely sitting in your ear there's no bass.  but grab the correct ear muffs that fit comfortably, seat them in your ear correctly and BOOM bass everywhere.  ok i'm done for good now.  these speakers are awesome.  period.SUPER COMFORTABLE!!!  So I read the reviews on here and I'm no sound buff, I just like quality sound.  If you're like me and 98% of the rest of people you'll definately be satisfied.  I definately hear the hiss, but I'm listening to an older quality video at the moment (on my work computer btw).  When someone pings me on the company messenger service, that ding is perfectly crystal clear.  It's old stuff that has the hiss only because your old garbage speakers wouldn't pick it up.  Put a DVD or recent, good quality MP3 or other audio and they work great.  Again, incredibly comfortable.  Come with a cool carry case and packaging was cake.  $25 WELL SPENT.  Not sure how long that sale will last but I"m incredibly satisifed.  No issues with customer service but I didn't have to contact them.  Check out the reviews here though; I was convinced without even ordering that I'd have no problem with this company.  Excellent buy and will highly recommend and definately purchase more for gifts for friends/family.  Thanks Jbud.

$REVIEW.: There are a few arguments against instant film in general, and then against the Instax Mini system specifically. While the image quality is better than many so-called 'toy cameras,' you can't go into the instant experience expecting tack-sharp, highly enlargeable results. I shoot film almost exclusively, and I shoot everything from tiny spy Minox cams up to large monorail view cams. Some cameras are methodical tools, requiring the user to iteratively run through series of movements, studying a sheet of ground glass until the image can be recorded perfectly on a sheet of film. And some cameras are just fun to use, full of limitations but full of joy. This is where instant comes in, and Fuji has done a pretty good job with their Instax systems. The other issue is in the divide between the Instax Mini and the Instax Wide. I personally think the Mini is great, even though plenty of people seem to think the images are too small to be practical. My opinion is that the Wide cameras, while producing nice large images, are too large and bulky to be fun. Which, again, is largely the point of instant for me. I use a 50s, which tucks out of the way in a bag pretty handily. So what to do with these card-sized images once you have them?I keep written correspondence with a number of people, and find that they're a great little pack-in for a personal touch. I suppose this was more a review of the system as a whole than of the film, so if you need a review of the film itself, here it is: there's only one emulsion for these cameras, and this is it. This film is useless without the system, and the system is useless without this film, and while there are multiple cameras to choose from, this is all you get for film. If you want a fun little instant system, I highly recommend Instax Mini. And if you take that advice, you're buying this film. I will say, in case it's a dealbreaker, that blues are strong on Instax - the images feel much cooler than Polaroid ever did. If you're looking for the crazy color palette of old Polaroids, you're not going to get it here. This again is a matter, though, of buying for an aesthetic or for the sake of something fun. And Instax is definitely fun.
$review_summary.: Great for correspondence!

It lends itself to a multitude of creative uses along with all of the other Ram accessories at prices that are very reasonable for the quality and workmanship.

$REVIEW.: I owned/used/abused the previous model for more than 6 years and man did it take a beating. It worked flawlessly until the little volume controller broke open and one of the wires broke off. I decided not to bother trying to fix it so i found this set and purchased it. Aside from looking cool and good price, they looked even sturdier than the last model headphones (including the volume controller). They fit comfortably, cover your ears completely and are not too tight. Good, full, clean sound (better if you can tweak it), and very loud. I Use them primarily for games, as you can hear the smallest of sounds. Good for watching TV privately if you really need to (although the cord gets in the way). Owned them for 1-1/2 years so far and not a scratch. For the price its a must have.

$review_text.: This is an almost idiot proof router to set up. The setup does not require any software and the router doesn't come with any. The instruction sheet is essentially one page, but no more is needed for a basic setup. However,you will need two cat-5 cables. The router comes with a chintzy 3 foot cable, but you may find it too short. One cable goes from your modem to the WAN port of the router, and the other from a router LAN port to your computer. Click on your web browser and follow the popup instructions for installation. Make a note of your password and the access key, which you supply. After completing the installation and rebooting your computer, click on the wireless icon on your desktop. Your new wireless connection should appear. Click on the new connection, supply the access key and you are done. Do that for all the computers on your network.The router was first manufactured in 03/2013, so the firmware should be up-to-date for awhile. The router appears quite adequate for a simple wireless network with light download needs. Hopefully it will last a couple of years. While this is not an advanced router, it has a few additional features, such as establishing guest accounts, which are not explained in the limited instruction sheet. If you need additional help you can go to the ASUS web site or call their tech support at 1-812--282-2787.

$review_text.: I used this battery grip with a rented Nikon D7100 for a weekend event shoot (over 2,000 photos taken with 2 camera bodies), and it held up very well

I have a similar off-brand battery grip for my own Nikon D7000, and this grip is built pretty much exactly the same.Almost everything (besides the screw, wiring, and the connection between the battery holders and the grip itself) is plastic, and probably won't last years, but at this price, I'm not worried about that
The rubber grip feels just like the camera body's rubber, and looks almost identical to the Nikon pattern

From a foot away, I'd be surprised if anyone could tell a difference between this grip and the Nikon OEM grip.The tripod screw that holds the grip to the body is able to be tightened as much as you want (the more the better, in some ways), though the little wheel you spin to tighten the screw is smaller than in the OEM grip and other off-brand grips I've used

It's not a big deal, but it makes your fingers feel slightly raw after tightening the grip snugly.The shutter release button actually feels great on this grip--not spongy, not too sticky or solid--both half-pressing and fully depressing the button worked great throughout the weekend

The OK/rocker is a little more clumsy than the nice one on the back of the D7100, but it works


All other buttons and switches feel very slightly plasticky, but they also work without a problem, so I'm not complaining.If you are going to use a vertical grip on your D7100 every day, instead of buying the expensive Nikon version of the grip, just buy a used D3 or something, and you'll have a 'built-in' vertical grip


The way I see it, I could buy two of these Neewer grips every year, and by the time I get a new camera body, I'll still be out ahead compared to buying just one Nikon grip
The difference between this and the Nikon is very slight, except when it comes to value :)

$review_text.: This camera is an upgrade from my Canon A40.  This camera is convenient and easy to use.  It maintains all the good features of my A40 but improves every one of them.  The adjustable LCD display is so useful when trying to take pictures in crowds.  You can still see what's going on even if you have to take pictures above tall people or have a limited view.Picture quality is top notch.  I have no complaints about the quality of pictures since the new processor seems to have ample power to process the digital images quickly.  VGA video mode on the camera is also fantastic.  For the casual videographer, I found it really useful since I don't own a camcorder.The only thing that I have concerns over is the construction.  It's good but some parts of the case seem to shift a little when held. Being heavy handed I feel like I might be crushing some internal components but everything seems to be fine.This is an excellent, affordable point and shoot digital camera.  Great picture quality and features.

$REVIEW.: I was not expecting a lot of quality in a case for less than $20

 I was wrong

 This is a really nice case

 I does everything that I want in a case for my Kindle Fire HDX 7


 I have read others complain that closing the case does not trigger sleep mode - what laziness!  Big deal!  So you have to press the power button on back (which is very accessible)


 And complaints that that stand does not support portrait mode is lame since most use their pads for media in landscape mode

 Moreover I read in landscape mode for the most part
 The times I use portrait mode are for some reading while I'm in sitting mode (as apposed to lying) and holding the kindle with one hand
 I think the case is quality made (unlike some critics) and feels much more expensive than $20


 I'm happy with the fit and button access as well as charging and headphone access (although I usually use Bluetooth)
 Moreover using my LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 Bluetooth Headset (from Amazon) with the Kindle Fire HDX 7 that is all dressed up in the MarBlue Ultra Lightweight Origin Case produces static free - CD quality - audio with no interference

 I highly recommend this case.

I was planning on using this a gift to a family member but it is going back asap.Several things to be aware of .The ports on the side of the camera are difficult to access


The buttons do no response easily to your touch, i.e the power switch is hard to manager and I have small hands and can't imagine a larger handed or male trying use that little switch


Pictures taken both video and still were of just average quality.The sound factor was most disturbing
One of the big things in doing video capture is to get some of the outside sounds well this camera really struggles to get any sound


Very low volume.Nothing I did on the camera or computer would increase the volumeThe software that is used to upload and view the clips is not easy to use either

Tried unsuccessfully a number of times to email a video clip


No go.
Viewing the clips and the stills in their software is not that easy either..Spend your money on the MOST popular sm video camera, Flip...
you'll be a lot happier over all.

$review_text.: I'm very impressed by the attention to detail and the quality of construction.  Every edge and corner is finished perfectly.  The paint job is fantastic.You can see plenty of pics and vids on the Web showing the easy to use drive mounts and the ample size, but until you start building with it, you can't appreciate the thought that went into the case.  For example, the wheels are placed in such a way that when you want to put the case on its side, the wheels don't "shoot out" from underneath; instead, the case rocks over into a relatively stable position for gently laying it down.One thing I didn't think about before building the system was how the fan on the side panel would be plugged in when I wanted to open the case.  No problem, it turns out, because here is another nice little touch:  The panel fits into the case in such a way as to act like it has a hinge if you apply a little frontwards pressure on the panel as you open.  In other words, you can swing open the panel enough to unplug the fan, and then you can remove the panel.Or, if you don't mind putting the case down, you can swing up the panel and keep it propped open (like the hood of a car) with a stick.The great benefits of the size of the case are cable management and airflow.  The fixed cables on big power supplies are very thick, but the back panel closed over everything with no problem at all.  On some boxes I have dreaded going back in because the cables are so tightly packed, but this is no issue at all with the HAF X.As for appearances, I think it looks great.  Pics on the Web seem to emphasize the futuristic, military looks and the lighted fans.  But in my office, it just looks like a very well made tower case, not flashy at all.  The window is not only for showing off your build, but for the practical purpose of observing LED indicators on the board.My only suggestions for improvement would be to include rubberized wheels, as the included ones slide more than roll on hard surfaces, and to provide a better instruction booklet for wiring the fans and LED's.Anybody buying computers these days knows that quality is becoming rare, which is sad.  That's one reason I so enthusiastically praise Cooler Master for this product (and the Hyper 212 Plus heatsink that looks so freakin' cool through the window!)

$REVIEW.: I'm in IT and have bought 6 of these so far. 2 for me and 4 for the company.For the business, the iSCSI targets are great for backups and virtualization.For home the SMB and FTP functionality is very useful. I put my movies on it and the built-in media server will stream right to my PS3! It will do your torrent downloads for you but I haven't taken advantage of that yet.I replaced a home built file server with one of three units and so far I've not regretted it. It even recognizes my UPS through the USB port so it can do a graceful shut down during power failure.The only reason I don't give it 5 starts is the performance isn't fantastic at times, and the web interface could use improvement. I don't like how much effort is involved with turning off unnecessary features and clearing unnecessary shares that it comes with.Update 11/5/2013:I have 2 of these units at home, and have purchased a total of about 6 for the company. On one of my units at home, I had a 2TB hard drive go bad. No big deal, but over the past few months I've seen at least another 4 hard drives go bad. Some of them have tested fine with other tools but others are bad for good. Seems like the ix2 doesn't treat CHEAP hard drives very well.I have a few ix4 units that seem to be easier on the drives. The ix4 is larger and appears to have better cooling. The ix2 NEEDS to be in a well ventilated area.The features are great, but you certainly get what you pay for. Make sure you have backups!

$review_text.: Just acquired an additional car and went through the agony of deciding which Garmin GPS to purchase.  The amount of negative write ups on all possibilities almost stopped this purchase.  I finally decided on this unit due to the fact that the positives out weighed the negatives.  It came yesterday and so far the negatives are just plain wrong!  This unit works exactly as it should and has lots of incremental improvements over my old GPS.  Further; the price is about half of what I paid 6 years ago.  Caveat; YOU CAN'T BE IN A HURRY to use the GPS.  You must download and install the Garmin package called Garmin Express, it is very simple to do.  Then you need to follow the on screen instructions to update the firmware and the map database.  The database is a lengthy process and took several hours but it can be left running unattended.  This morning I took the GPS out on the front porch and it was ready to go almost the instant I turned it on; VERY VERY FAST.  So far everything is operating just the way Garmin intended and I believe that this was an excellent choice on my part.  No; I do NOT work for Garmin but do appreciate when things work properly.
$SUMMARY.: Garmin has really improved since 2008!

$review_text.: When I first installed the adapter, I didn't seat the HDMI cable correctly, and it didn't work. You'll hit some resistance as the connecter goes in, and you have to give it a little &#34;Umph&#34; to get past that and seat the cable correctly. At first I was going to knock off a star or two for that, but changed my mind. It's not a problem or shortcoming with the adapter, but rather an operator malfunction. Get the cable seated right, and it's a good, solid connection. It doesn't do a lot, but it does the job perfectly when you use it right. This is how good tech works.

I do tell a significant difference when listening to music. Listening to talk podcasts, however, are perfectly clear. I guess I could say music sounds slightly hollow, subtle but noticeable. I will probably go with JVC Marshmallow (changhing the foam ear buds to silicon ones) or $20-30 Sonys next time.All said and done, these are more durable than many other buds I've had.

$REVIEW.: As others reported, this KVM switch works perfectly with macs - at this price point I couldn't be happier. I have a Mac Mini (MY2012) and MacBook Pro (MY2011)  on the input side, and a Dell U2713HM (2560x1440) on the output.I chose to plug my monitor's USB (v3.0) hub into one of the three USB (v2.0) KVL outputs, and left my keyboard and mouse plugged into the monitor's internal USB hub, and the KVL switch is working seamlessly in this configuration.In case anyone was wondering, the built-in audio jack in the Dell monitor (carried over the DisplayPort connection, I believe) also continues to function properly. It appears to be detected correctly/successfully by both Macs (when selected via the KVM switch).As a nice perk of the mac software, I found that once I select the Dell's audio device as output, the laptop automatically toggles to/from it as the preferred audio out device when I switch the KVM to/from the laptop. Very handy.The manufacturer's info about the included cables is pretty sparse, so here's some info on what I found in the box:- There are two separate KVM cables included in the box- Each cable is about 4 feet long (more or less - didn't measure)- Each cable actually contains two separate cables molded together - USB and DisplayPort- The USB portion is a USB A to USB B connector- The DisplayPort portion is a full sized DisplayPort (Male) to full size DisplayPort (Male) connectorSince I am using macs as my input devices, I was only able to use one of the two included cables. I used an included cable to connect the KVM switch to my monitor (both USB and DisplayPort connections), and then purchased separate USB A to USB B and mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort cables to wire my macs to the KVM switch.
$SUMMARY.: Works well with macs

$REVIEW.: I like this mouse, it's compact and feels very solid.  Pairing was no problem at my work.  At home, I have an older desktop PC which does not have Bluetooth, so could not test.Overall, I think pairing is simple and easy.  My issue here is once you're paired, easiness is gone and comparisons to other mice become easier.  I don't even consider having bluetooth connection a plus, my main Logitech mouse at home is a regular plug-in receiver, and connecting it by getting down on your hands and knees and crawling around my hard drive looking for empty USB slot was not as bad as bluetooth mouse geniuses would make you believe.Currently I own Verbatim's touch [like apple] mouse [ASIN:B004GKM9SG Verbatim 97564 Wireless Optical Touch Mouse (Piano Black)]] and Logitech's full featured beast of a mouseLogitech Wireless Performance Mouse MX for PC and Mac.  I still prefer my Logitech mouse.  It fits in my hand beautifully, has many buttons I assigned keys to, and it's rechargeable.  Seems Sculpt Mouse's batteries like to run out quickly.

What more to say than this is a great wireless mouse with the smallest USB dongle I've seen (I think it's starting to be the standard) and the mouse feels great, works great and looks great (wish they made a red one).

Maybe there's something in the technology I couldn't detect that makes them worth a higher price tag? I don't know.Price aside, these are quite great

The set up was quick and easy, just insert the 2 AAA batteries that came with it and voila!The combination keyboard cover and stand is unique.  The protective cover comes off and bends into an L-shape to support the tablet.

$review_text.: As others have noted, the drive does get hot in the enclosure and it required two USB connections to properly power the drive.  I mention this for those wishing to use it with a pogoplug.  It will require two of the USB ports on the plug to power some drives, which diminishes the value of the pogoplug.Otherwise the enclosure works as expected.  My drive does not move inside the enclosure and so far has generated no errors.
$SUMMARY.: Product works as expected.

$review_text.: I just replaced my Linksys AE 1000, with the newer AE 3000.  Using the same base, just a simple swap between the devices, I was able to achieve over 12 db in received signal level according to InSSid'er, on my 5 ghz band net.  The 2.4 ghz band showed a smaller improvement.While my connect speed of the link is not 270 mbps, it is consistently 216 mbps.Installing was a breeze using the web based software from Linksys support.  I didn't even need to open the factory supplied disc.  I just downloaded from the web, then swapped devices.This adapter is a major improvement over the older Linksys adapter.I heartily recommend it, especially if you live in a congested area where the 2.4 ghz band is crowded and you have the ability to use the 5 ghz band.

$REVIEW.: This light is very bright and definitely covers the entire Kindle screen.  I like the flexibility for adjustment.There were a few minor problems that caused me to give it 4 instead of 5 stars:The clip to attach is so big that I need to clip it to a cover rather than to the Kindle itself, which is not a problem for me, because I can adjust the neck of it, but if I had not gotten the extra flexible I am sure it would not have been the same. Also I usually read my Kindle in its cover, but if you don't use a cover when reading I suggest getting something that is more light weight and easier to attach.I have only had this for two days so can't comment on whether its brightness after more uses.Disappointment two: again minor :  Of the lights I have tried this is the only one that did not come with its own batteries and the instructions were folded into the battery compartment.  The product sheet is very small.  I wish when a product was over $10 at least they would include a nice size instruction paper.I think in the long run, replacing these batteries may be cheaper  than the round ones though. (Knowing I would need these batteries I had purchased a package before product arrived).I suggest everyone who orders one of these do the same, have the batteries on hand for when the light is delivered.

$review_text.: The Ambient Weather WR-111B is a multi-featured device that will be a handy addition to our hurricane kit this year.It is perfect for us, for use in an emergency situation that leaves us without power which happens at least once a year in our area of the US (SW Gulf Coast, Florida)


 It is fairly compact and easy to use


 The crank is comfortable, even with my arthritic hands, and doesn't require lengthy cranking to charge up the battery to use the radio or light

 Cell phone batteries will require more juice from this device, and thus more cranking, but it is very efficient with power when using the flashlight or radio features

 This is the sort of device I am comfortable leaving in our emergency kit as the dedicated emergency radio and light and I like that it is an all-in-one so I don't have to keep track of so many odds and ends when doing my annual check of our kit's contents.It offers AM/FM/NOAA digital radio, an extremely bright LED flashlight, and it has a built in battery that can be charged with a crank/dynamo and a cell phone can be charged off of that battery

 Good features, that are easy to use
 I wouldn't hesitate adding one of these to my elderly parent's kit as well.It also has a NOAA certified weather alert, but as SW Floridians I find that most weather radios have specific tuning for each county

 This has more general weatherband tuning, which is fine, particularly when we have already battened down the hatches and are just trying to find out what is going on outside and if we have to take more serious cover for a tornado
 It does not offer the SAME tuning for specific counties, but I was able to tune in to my general area, though I will not be using this as an alert radio during the season, as my regular wall mounted weather radio has more specific tuning and alerts

 I will be using this as a much more "active use" device, during actual storm conditions
 I don't find that the lack of SAME tuning and more options for alerts (volume, which alerts we do and don't need to hear, etc) is a problem, as I do not intend to use this particular radio to warn us of tornadoes, icebergs, etc...If you are looking for a basic weather radio with SAME tuning and alert customization, you might look at one of the Midland radios.For emergency kits and shelters, and even camping, this would be a fine choice


 My only concern is that it "looks" rugged but isn't water proof or water resistant, so if caught outside, in the rain with this it might not fare so well


 Perhaps stashing it in a zipper baggie would be a wise move if taking it hiking, or when traveling to shelter during a storm.


$SUMMARY.: Perfect addition to our emergency kit.

$review_text.: Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Cover i5The i5 uses Bluetooth to connect with the iPad Air, and it paired up easily within a few seconds. I also have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition, so I decided to try the i5 with that tablet and it connected just as easily. Note that the i5 has several Apple-specific hotkeys, one of which reminds me of the old Macintosh keyboard.The battery charges fast using any standard charger with a micro-USB cable. There is a hardware power button for the keyboard, as well as a Bluetooth key to pair it with a device.There are 2 magnetic sections of the i5. One section keeps the iPad Air connected to the spine so the iPad Air closes with the i5 like the cover of a book. The i5&#8217;s backing is almost exactly the same material, texture, and color as the iPad Air &#8211; which both have an aluminum/magnesium type material. The other magnetic section keeps the iPad Air connected to the i5 while it is propped at an angle. Note that the iPad Air will fall out from this position if the i5 is turned upside down, the magnet isn&#8217;t that strong.As a PC user, I am used to having an Escape (Esc) key in the upper left corner. On the i5, the Esc key location is the Home button (square) for the iPad (which even has the same marking as the home buton for the iPad and iPhone). On the Android tablet (Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition), this button actually works as the Menu button.The button on the right of the spacebar is a language hotkey that allows you to switch between different keyboards on the fly with the iPad Air. This is useful if you desire the use of another country&#8217;s keyboard without having to go through the Settings/International menu.The i5 keys are chiclet keys and are rather quiet. They are tightly packed together, making typing somewhat a chore when I am used to larger full-sized keyboards. However, it is far easier to type on (and faster) than the onboard keyboard. Depending on the app, there&#8217;s either no lag for the keyboard (Gmail), or there is some lag (Google Quickoffice).The two biggest drawbacks to using the i5 over something like the Apple or Moko slim smart case is that the i5 lacks adequate protection for the iPad Air itself and it somewhat detracts from the whole tablet experience. Even with the i5 and iPad Air closed up like a book during transport, there&#8217;s nothing protecting the iPad&#8217;s back and there is no mechanism to keep the iPad closed so theoretically it could open up in a bag and allow an object to get jammed in between the screen and keyboard. I&#8217;d also be concerned that the magnetic binding could come apart in a bag and allow the iPad to move around loose. In the keyboard mode, the iPad is very exposed. As for the tablet experience, it is more convenient to keep the tablet on hand when consuming media. Turning it into a laptop with a mechanical keyboard changes the way the iPad is used but it certainly can be done and this is just my honest observation.Overall: 4/5 stars, I wish it had a way to keep the iPad and i5 closed together to prevent it from flapping open accidentally. I&#8217;d also like to see more protection for the iPad when used with the i5. An alternative is to use a tri-fold cover for the iPad and the i5 as a separate keyboard.

So I thought I'd give it a try.This is a nice piece of equipment. It is very sturdy and stable, easily handling an SLR camera and lens. The ball head works very well and the quick release is easy to use. The legs lock into 3 positions for taking pictures from full height to close to the ground. My only disappointment is that the head doesn't have handles, but I knew that before I bought it. It will just take getting used to. Otherwise, a great product at a great price.

They had two postings for the same tablet so please don't think I didn't buy it because I did.

$review_text.: I bought the unit with 2 pre-installed drives.  The unit itself is solidly built but the drives were not installed with love.  Only half the screws holding the drives in place were in place and they were loose.  The rest were rattling around inside the box.  The drives are not easily reachable or replaceable.  You need a screwdriver to remove the back plate and you need it again to remove the drives.The unit has all the features that you could want and is very reasonably priced but it is difficult to use and the manual is not well written.  You will need to read the manual to get it working and you will need to know networking beyond the manual to get media streaming to work.  The wizards which help you with the setup are not all that smart.  I have above average knowledge of networking and NAS devices for a casual user (I already have a Snap server NAS) at home but I still could not figure out how to get all the features to work and in the end, returned the device after 3 weeks back to Amazon.  I did not see the option available, but if there was reasonably priced paid support available for the setup, I would have paid for it since the device itself was inexpensive compared to similarly powered and sized competition.

$REVIEW.: This great little cable system does more than the original picture and description might indicate
 I uploaded a new picture to help show this.This item includes both L/R RCA male plugs as shown PLUS a 3.5mm male stereo plug

 The 3.5mm is typically what you want for cars that have an AUX input jack.This item also includes 12V and GND wires for power to charge your i-device

 Nice here is that you don't need a separate charger connector - everything passes through the i-device dock connector

 To install for power, just access some kind of accessory power that is switched on when the ignition or the stereo is on

I used the 12V power plug in the dash of my wife's 2008 Honda Odyssey
 Just remove the center console and gently splice the kit's two wires into those 12V and GND wires feeding the power plug, and you're good

 Takes 30 minutes or less with a screwdriver, sharp utility knife, and electrical tape (I also soldered the connections for better electrical and mechanical contact).There was also plenty of cable in my installation to pass the i-device dock connector through one of the console compartments, and the 3.5mm plug under the bottom of the console, where it can easily be plugged into the Odyssey's stereo AUX input jack when needed.Audio quality is great, it charges nicely (iPads, too) and no funny warning messages in your i-device when you connect like I've seen in the past with this thing in my old 2005 Honda CRV:USA-Spec PA15-HON2 Honda to iPod Interface


 Sweet.

$review_text.: I got this Day One edition because I didn't want to go through the same thing I did when the Xbox 360 came out.  I could not get my hands on the second-gen Xbox back in November 2005, so I wanted to get this one, even though I had already made up my mind that PS4 was going to be my main system for multi-platform gaming.  I held off from purchasing Forza 5, Dead Rising 3, and Ryse... and I'm very glad that was the case.I played the Dead Rising 3 demo and hated it.  Not saying it's a bad game, but I never got into the previous games, and this one is just more of the same.  I don't like the Dead Rising franchise.I don't care for the Forza franchise.  I only played the first one, and that took me less than two hours total.  Not for me.I actually had some hopes that Ryse would be the game that I would pick up for this brand new console.  Something that would hold my interest until something nicer came along.  After reading several reviews, and listening to several opinions of the game, I would not risk $60 to figure out if it is something that I would like.  Perhaps when it goes down to $40 I might consider it.That leaves me with Killer Instinct.  I really dislike the KI games from it's inception, and I dislike them even more here as a free-to-play game.  The game is pretty much a demo that you have to buy additional characters, or packs to make it complete.  The good news is that I didn't have to spend a dime to realize that I don't like this game now as much as I didn't like it back in the day of the SNES.  Just for the record, I also don't like the Mortal Kombat games after MK2.Kinect 2.0 voice recognition is a thing that I find very frustrating.  I tried several voice commands, from telling the system to turn on, to navigating through the tiles and other software in the system.  I just gave up voice commands and now just do everything with my controller.  It is less frustrating, but not necessarily easier.TitanFall is not the game that's going to make it all good.  $60 for an online multiplayer ONLY game is not a good deal to me.  Add in a campaign mode and that would make it work.The Xbox One UI is a streamlined and confusing version of the Xbox 360 and Windows 8 tile-theme, un-officially known as the &#34;Metro&#34; UI.  While you could tell how much storage space you have with the X360, the Xbone won't even show how much storage you have available.  Having to rely on websites like IGN to do investigative work to really find out how much of the 500gb is actually free to use by the consumer.Now, for the few good thing this console does... It does Xbox Fitness remarkably well.  I spent a few minutes with the software, and Kinect 2.0 really shines when it comes to tracking your movements.  It is significantly better than my experiences with the previous Kinect, and better than the Playstation Camera on PS4.  Maybe because the PS4 doesn't have compelling camera software yet, but I would have to give this one to Microsoft's console.While I considered selling my console at one point, it would be foolish to get rid of it now that I had it for a few weeks.  I will hold on to it and wait for something remarkable to happen.  Who knows, maybe one downloadable game will be exclusive to the console and it will start justifying the cost of the console.  For now, I will continue to receive my FREE GAMES on PS+ (can't get any free games on XbOne yet), and play the best versions of shooters like CoD: Ghosts (1080p on PS4 vs upscaled 720p on XbOne), and Battlefield 4.

The computer was at a distant location so I couldn't test the streaming capabilities before I bought the Veebeam. Even though I have a 3 year old HD Core2 duo laptop with 2.5 GB ram and a high end N router and N cable modem, the computer isn't fast enough to stream HD video properly. The Veebeam will stream EXACTLY what is being displayed on the laptop with virtually no lag. I had the device 6' from my router. I contacted Veebeam several times and they were absolutely the best to work with. I ended up sending it back to Amazon and had no issues with the return. The Veebeam is a GREAT product and their support is the best. I just don't have a fast enough computer.

 Unfortunately, within less than a year, the sound from one side stopped

 Appeared to be a problem with the cable, based on trying to move the cable around and hearing intermittent sound

 FYI, he was using other headphones in addition to these during that time
 Got another pair during another sale since he liked the first pair so much


 That was a stupid mistake, since the second pair developed a similar problem within less than a year at a different point in the cable.Among the other headphones that he's used over the past couple years, including some really cheap ones, only one other had a similar failure.

I'm sure a true audiofile might disagree, but I hear very little difference in sound quality from the HDMI connection I had through the TiVo before

This O/S does NOT recognize or provide support for cards over 32GB.2) Windows Vista/7 - supports FAT, EXFAT and NTFS but NOT FAT32.Specifically in my case, I use CHDK software for my Canon camera which requires a FAT32 filesystem. I couldn't use either Windows XP nor Windows Vista to format this 64GB card in FAT32 format! Nor could I use the camera itself to format the card because CHDK requires itself be loaded on a pre-formatted, BOOTABLE SD card.I finally found a free software (EaseUS Disk and Partition Manager) which allowed me to format the entire 64GB card with a FAT32 filesystem (using 32k clusters) on a Vista PC.I have another video camera from Panasonic which uses the EXFAT filesystem so I just used the camera itself to format the card and everything was fine.If you don't want these hassles, just buy two 32GB cards and be happy.I took me HOURS to figure this all out for the FAT32 filesystem - it just would be nice if Sandisk would include a little cross-reference with this particular card with a link to a FAQ and some free software that would resolve this issue. Instead they just ship out a 64GB SDXC card and say "good luck". 4 stars for that lack of consumer support.

$REVIEW.: Not much to it. You just point it at your camera, and press the one and only button, and it takes the pic. I use this on my Canon T3i, and it worked right away. All you have to do is scroll to the shooting mode, and select the "10 sec delay/remote" mode. Then point the remote at the camera and press the shutter button, and it snaps a pic. Pretty simple. And dont worry, it wont give you a 10 second delay, it snaps the pic right when you press the remote button. Or you can switch to a 2 second delay on the back of the remote. And like youve probably noticed from the pics, it is small. Small than a credit card, and thinner than a cell phone, so it stores easily.

I just slipped the new drive into the computer, formatted it, and dropped the old drive in the Macally enclosure and booted from it using the firewire cable

$review_text.: I too bought the keyboard for my Asus tablet.  Had to have it!  Like all new things on the market, hold off till the reviews and fixes come in.I waited, but not long enough.  Soon after I bought the keyboard I noticed a strange battery drain when I left the tablet attached to the keyboardand it was turn off.  The keyboard has a "convenience" setting (according to Asus) where the keyboard is never off, just goes to sleep so that youhave fast access to the tablet.  Well, we know that's BullCra....  I called Asus and they do have a fix for all the normal people that like to turntheir device off.  Just pay shipping to return it to Asus and they will correct that slight inconvenience.  Asus pays to ship it back to you.  Tookabout 2 weeks turn-a-round.Now for the review on the keyboard.....It is made with the Asus known quality and design.  It is nice to type on.  I didn't like the interface withthe tablet.  If you use a wireless laser mouse with USB, your basically wasting your time.  The tablet in my opinion is like using alarge data cell phone(which is fine).  The keyboard just adds to the weight.  I love my Asus tablet but it's "NOT" a laptop.  The keyboard just allowsyou to type off the screen thus giving you full screen.  Weird things happen is all I can say.  I am spoiled from using my Mac laptop and a tablet itis not.  Buying a keyboard for this deice is only mascurating the attempt to create a laptop.  Critics will slam me and call it user error or stupidity.I just sold my Asus keyboard here on Amazon for a fair price.  The new owner got a great deal with the keyboard battery issue fixed.  My Asus tablet isnow thin and keyboard free.

$review_text.: Great TV!!! We saw a 8000 model in BestBuy and were looking to buy that. I did some research and in the end settled with this 7000 model. I feel the picture is just the same and also I saved $400 by going with this.We checked out the Sony also, but feel that the Samsung had a superior picture. The picture is absolutely amazing, both with BluRay and also HD TV stations. The picture is extremely clear and adds depth to the picture. Once you put the glasses on it adds a fun 3d experience. Although currently there are limited 3d movies titles available. I believe a lot more will be released later in 2011. Also be aware that the glasses are currently $150 each!We got a great deal. Along with the TV we received a free 3d BluRay player and Shrek starter kit (x2 glasses and Shrek 1, 2, 3 and 4).Be aware that this 50" is plasma, whereas the other sizes are LCD. Plasma actually offers a slightly better picture quality to LCD with deeper blacks; but it is not good for video games. You could experience the image being burnt in with excessive playing. If you want to play video games on this TV, I would recommend one of the other sizes which is LCD.As with most TV's the speakers on the TV are not up to par. I would recommend that you add some kind of sound system. I went with a Pioneer 920 receiver, with BIC America DV62si speakers with a BIC America center speaker and F12 subwoofer. All can be had on Amazon for about $700 with free shipping. The sound is amazing and matches the picture. It really gives you the full "theater" experience.I also recommend the square trade extended warranty. It is pretty reasonably priced and protects your purchase. I find modern day electronics don't last that long and it is a nice piece of mind to have the warranty.

$review_text.: Ya,ya,ya it's not the prettiest fan you've ever seen but unlike normal $6.00 case fans this blows strong, consistent and quietly for many many years. They give you speed reducers but wide open these are so quiet why put them in? This design has the added benefit of a focus flow so the air is channeled and remains in a focused air flow as it exits the fan blades. I've replaced all my fans for 120mm Noc's except for a 240mm side fan and a pair of 50mm's in the rear. The only fans I hear are those 50mm's and it's not much noise but I sure wish Noctua built small fans but they only go from 80mm to 140mm. Get these fans, start with one or two and you'll replace them all......it's for sure !

I will take it off the charger, and it just won't turn on even though it's been sitting on charge for days. If I plug it back in, and remove it again, the power button is magically working.3) There is an audible hum that you can hear when nothing is going on.I still think this is a much better unit for the price than the included headphones.

$REVIEW.: The sound quality of this headset is great for music, and the earbuds effective cut out a lot of the noise of your environment. I use mine daily on my vanpool commute, and I can hardly hear the overall van noise (and I can't hear conversations at all) when I use it.I do have two objections to it, however. First, there is no sidetone. For those of you too young (or ignorant) to have ever used a landline telephone, sidetone is the old-style telephone's ability to take what you say into the handset microphone and--while transmitting it to the other persons on the line--repeat it into your own earpiece. Sidetone is an incredibly subtle yet powerful way to ensure that your conversation has a feeling of coherency and contiguous flow. Without sidetone--and this headset DOES NOT provide sidetone--one has a tendency to feel disconnected from one's own speech. That problem is greatly exacerbated with a headset such as this that so effectively cuts outside sound. You almost literally can't hear yourself speak clearly.If you want to see what it feels like to talk on this headset, put your fingers into your ears tightly, and speak. That &#34;I'm hearing myself from inside my head&#34; sound is all you get with this headset. I find it as annoying as telecommunications pioneers a hundred years ago did--and thus invented sidetone.My second objection is that the bluetooth music streaming cuts out for about two seconds at the start of every track, and, on occasion, while you are just walking around (even with your phone in your pocket). I have had two of these--frankly, I lost the first one--and experienced software versions 1.0 and 3.0, the latter being the current software at the time of this writing. The cutout problem isn't improved.HOWEVER, I'm really not sure there's a better stereo bluetooth headset on the market--certainly not one at this excellent price. Recommended, make no mistake, but with one star's worth of reservation.

$REVIEW.: The Satechi Soundfly SD WMA/MP3 Player Car Fm Transmitter is a perfect solution for playing music through any car radio regardless of the radio's options (CD, Cassette, etc.).  I've only used it with a USB thumbdrive so far and have found the sound quality and range to be very good.  It does not inject any noise or hiss into the music. I liked mine so much that I bought another as a gift and the recipient also loves it.I also bought an AC to 12 volt DC adapter and use it in the house to broadcast to various stereo systems throughout the house.  It can usually override all but the strongest stations and having the ability to easily program and select seven different frequencies is great.  It's easy to use and overall given the price, quality, and features I highly recommend the product.  Extremely satisfied.Update - after a year not only is it still working great, but after seeing mine a friend and a family member had to have one too, so I bought two more and gave them as gifts.  They can't say enough good things about the Soundfly and love theirs as much as I do mine.  Best presents I ever gave.

$REVIEW.: Although this Vizio cannot compete with higher-end HD televisions boasting 120 HZ and 1080p resolution, it was far the best performer in the price range I was considering, although I did shop around to find the best price.  I consider this the largest set (32") that can still deliver a crisp LCD picture with 720p/60HZ specs.  You won't notice the difference unless you already have a higher end television; even then, most people cannot tell the difference at this size.  The picture is bright and sharp, particularly when using the "Vivid" picture setting.  Set-up is mostly intuitive, although there was one hiccup, as I'll describe later.Pros:  price/value; crisp, bright picture; good remote; mostly easy set-up; 2 HDMI input connections, plus component, RGB, and RF; 100,000 to 1 contrast ratio; excellent picture with HD, DVD, or Blu-Ray input; you can use the included stand or hang it on the wall; sleek appearance.Cons: specifications that are becoming outdated; difficult to reach connections in the back of the set (connect everything before you put it in place!)The only momentary problem I had occurred when the TV wouldn't pick up the cable channels.  A quick look at the troubleshooting section of the handbook pointed me toward the manual tuning feature, which took five minutes or so to load all the channels.  Because an Amazon reviewer recommended that owner use the retail setting for the best picture (instead of the Energy/ECO setting), I ended up with a picture that displayed Vizio's advertised specs at the bottom.  To get rid of the display, I had to select the Home setting -- and I had to search for the channels all over again.  (Note:  as long as you select "Vivid" as your picture mode, you will get the brightness you saw at the store.)  I found that 32" is the perfect size for a bedroom, apartment, or other small to mid-size room.HD televisions really need an HD source to look their best, so if you only have a regular digital picture, you will see less than sharp edges, although the picture is still fine, especially from a distance.  HD signals -- whether from cable or satellite or Blu-Ray -- really show up well on this set and are well worth the extra expense if you can afford it.  Because manufacturers are selling fewer and fewer 720p/60 HZ sets, you should look for bargains, as many of these models are being discontinued and therefore discounted.

$review_text.: Other reviews will give you a better sense of the technical specs for this camera, but my specialty seems to be explaining things in terms "the rest of us" can understand :) And the bottom line is that this is may be the most sophisticated pocket-sized camera I've seen. Its zoom is fairly limited at only 4x, and I wasn't able to enlarge the pictures for use as backgrounds in my kids' yearbook, but otherwise it has options you can generally only find on a DSLR (which are usually 2-4 times as big, and therefore somewhat prone to being left at home when you need to bring other things along, like books or small children).PROS* Super-easy to use (once you figure out that twisting the zoom is also how to turn the camera on)* Somehow manages to give you a TON of different options without overwhelming you with buttons or menus; even has an awesome "Q" button that displays a quick grid of all your settings so you can easily select and tweak the ones you want to change if you don't feel like jumping through menus. This is a lifesaver when you want to change 4 settings and don't want to futz with shuffling up and down through menus 4 times. (It also has a C1 and C2 button to quickly toggle between two distinct sets of "manual" camera settings)* Has a few buttons on the left side for more-common functions (like "play" and "burst mode" and white balance) so they're easy to access* Takes good pictures (reference technical reviews and samples if you want more details on that front; for most of us, the pictures will be entirely usable)* Modes: I can't list them all, but it has pretty much every mode I've ever seen on another camera (sunset, beach, fireworks, sports, portrait, soft skin portrait, indoor party, nighttime still, toy camera, panorama, spot color (6 of them), landscape, flower, night, snow, beach, text, dynamic tone, high key, low key, etc.). When I'm out with kids, I just put it on "sports" (for most things), or "portrait"/"pro focus" (if I want a more artistic shot with the background blurred out), and save the other options for a day when I have more time* Has good color options that are quite easy to select or change: standard, intense ("velvia"), B&W;, sepia... plus the aforementioned 6 "spot color" options where one color (like blue) is kept, and everything else is B&W;, plus a bunch of ways to manually tweak the color that I confess are beyond my ability* Specs:  the f-stop ranges from 2.0 to 11 (so it's on the "bright" side, as their marketing says, but is good at focusing on _just_ the element you want in your picture, and has decent options for letting you select precisely which element that is); the shutter speed ranges from 4" to 1/4000, so that's a broad range. You're going to have more luck getting portraits, sport shots, and pictures of moving objects (children included) than you will of waterfalls, or other things where you want a slow shutter speed without whiting out the entire screen (which a waterfall shot would do without a higher f-stop option, or an external "neutral density filter"), but slow-shutter-speed evening/night shots are just fine* Has a fairly wide angle at 28mm, which makes life easier if you're photographing a children's museum or an indoor birthday party (people don't have to squish together quite as much to fit into your image)* Can fit into a (large) pocket. Barely ;) But it's still teeny tiny compared to a DSLR, and really easy to grab and go.CONS* Only 4x zoom - better than no zoom at all, but it's much easier to compose pictures well with a 10x or 15x optical zoom, especially if your child is across a soccer field and you want to have them be the clear star in your photo* An indicator on the side tells you what your exposure is, but the LCD doesn't always reflect it. So it might look normal on your screen, but if you mess with the settings in manual mode, the picture itself could be super-light or super-dark (so you have to pay attention to the exposure indicator on the side). This isn't much of an issue in modes where it automatically decides the exposure for you, but be aware that it can be an issue in "manual" mode* The pictures can't be enlarged as much as you may hope. The camera supports 12mp (3000x4000 pixels), but when I tried to stretch the images for use as backgrounds in my kids' yearbook, the software informed me that the resolution simply wasn't high enough (it was happy with the 6000 x 4000 pixel images from my DSLR). So if you ever print images for wall-art or posters, double-check that the resolution will be high enough for you
$SUMMARY.: DSLR-like pocket-sized camera (limited by its zoom)

$review_text.: We're very happy with this choice from Amazon, and the price is right.  We wanted a modest bedroom system with an AM/FM radio, a single CD player, AND a port for an iPod.  It had to fit onto a shelf in the credenza by our bed, and we wanted separate L and R speakers for good stereo separation on that shelf, with "decent" sound for nighttime listening.  The supplied remote control is a definite plus.  This unit fits our needs well and the sound, reflected and enhanced from the interior of the credenza, is quite satisfying.  The port for an iPod was needed because we wanted to listen to our hundreds (literally) of early radio programs and other stored MP3 files for late night listening.  The supplied digital clock is also a plus.  One thing we had to get used to was interpreting the instruction sheet for the remote control.  Some functions where one button press was indicated really needed TWO, and some of the button combinations required detailed familiarization.  We were aware of criticisms from other reviewers concerning the actual layout of this remote, and they had some merit.  However, we've found that once you get used to its idiosyncrasies, this is still a great little system for the price.

It works well and is incredibly small and simple to use. The sound quality is better than the Belkin. It seems less hollow and tinny. The sound quality is much better in my husband's truck than in my car. I think the type of car speakers you have makes a difference.

$review_text.: this is a full-featured 5MP compact camera that will work for a wide range of users.  i compared this with the sony DSC-P10 and the minolta DiMAGE F100 and concluded that this had the best feature set in its class.the S50 is essentially a 'shrunk' PowerShot G5.  there are some differences: the G5 has a flip-out LCD which is very cool and quite practical, a 4x zoom lens, and a flash attachment.  otherwise, the S50 provides almost the same level of manual control as the G5 in a smaller package.  if you want point and shoot capability but want the flexibility to be more creative when you want, this camera should be on your short list.pros:- excellent resolution from a small lens - 5MP power!- 3x optical zoom, 4x digital- good metering and good tonal balance - maintains shadow detail- good natural light white balance, strong and balanced colours- allows control over cameras internal processing algorithms - saturation, tone, sharpness- low noise at ISO 50 (keep in mind that ISO 50 for this camera is actually ISO 100 for everyone else; likewise, ISO 100 is in reality closer to ISO 200, etc)- compact and lightweight, considering this camera's capabilities (4.4 x 2.3 x 1.7 in, 11.1 oz)- excellent build quality - solid 'brick like' feel - no creaks or rattles and a good positive feel to external controls- nice metallic black finish - i definitely prefer this to the silver finish of other compact cameras- the LCD monitor is also big (1.8") for this class of camera - gives good live preview and review even in well lit situations- shooting priority play mode (a half-press of the shutter release always returns to shooting)- excellent range of manual controls- fast shot-to-shot times- fairly good startup time, especially for an extending lens camera- the manual focus has magnified loupe and ruler readout- flexible continuous shooting modes (buffer after processing)- RAW file format maintains 12-bits of data- ability to turn JPEG shot into RAW during record review- Compact Flash Type I/II and official Microdrive support- voice annotation feature- invervalometer (time lapse capability)- AF assist lamp works well- USB connectivitycons:- average macro performance- vignetting at wide angle and maximum aperture- nine-point AiAF not available in P, TV, AV, M or C exposure modes- average flash performance- the four-way jog dial is not easy to use - pressing "SET" takes practice- you'll need to remove from tripod to open the battery/CF compartment- lens slow at telephoto (F4.9)- AF Assist lamp doesn't have enough power at telephoto zoom- limited apertures at telephoto- zoom controller does not have enough steps / multiple zoom speed- some barrel distortion at wide anglethis is a fantastic camera - highly recommended.  enjoy!

I thought it was because my camera was too heavy for it, but after I tried my cheap-ass light weight camera, I realized it was the mount that sucked...not me.  If you want to buy a good windshield mount, go for the contour suction cup mount.  it is super sturdy, and has a 1/4 20 screw which is the same as the one on this thing.

$REVIEW.: If you have a desktop, you should buy an accurate laser mouse (as well as a mechanical keyboard) to replace the cheap thing that came with it. And, a corded mouse will be far more cost effective (my 1600 dpi ProWave wireless mouse eats batteries compared to the keyboard for which I paid under $60). I consider this 1000 dpi mouse to be a bit small (and my hands are a bit small already) even though others complain about it being too large (go figure). But, I prefer the feel over the 2000dpi MS Sidewinder mice. I paid under $20. If you want to pay a little more, there's the newer gaming 3600 dpi Logitech G400 while some still prefer the feel of the older 1800 dpi Logitech MX 518. I would instead recommend the 2011 3500 dpi Razer Deathadder (which also comes in a left-handed version), which can be found for under $35.

$review_text.: Reading the other reviews I feel like I got a completely different hard drive than some of the other people
First off this was the Mac formatted 3 TB drive


I took it out of the box and noticed that it came with one USB cable and 3 power adapters (presumably a couple were coverters for foreign contries?)
I plugged one end into the drive and the familiar looking one into my surge protected power strip and the USB cable into the drive and my MacBook

It showed up on my desktop without a problem and I checked and I verified that it was Mac formatted - which it was

There was some software on the drive to use with the drive


It appeared to be backup software with versions for both Windows and Mac - but I ignored that


My purpose for getting this drive was to combine my music files from a 1 TB drive which was near full, and a 2 TB drive which was roughly 25% full onto one drive so I would have redundancy in case any of the drives failed

I just dragged my iTunes libraries from each of my existing drives into two new folders on the 3 TB drive (one labeled 1TB Bkup and the other 2TB Bkup) one drive at a time


The copying took a lot less time than I expected it would but since my MacBook Pro only had a USB2 port I can't vouch for the velocity of USB3 that others have questioned and claimed the drive didn't qualify for


I've used the drive for 3 weeks now so I can't vouch for how long it's going to last either as it's too soon to tell - however I've had other Seagate and Western Digital drives and they seem to last a long time - the worst drives I ever had were Maxwell - they lasted less than a year.For what it's worth the drive comes with the ability to also use a Firewire and Thunderbolt cable (sold separately) with it.All in all I'm quite satisfied with the drive right now

Since installing this hard drive I've since acquired a new Macbook Pro with a USB3 port so I will be connecting this drive over to that laptop and will see if I notice the speed difference - which I should be able to with some simple test transfers.

 This does 3D passthrough great from blu ray to TV
 Make sure on setup you go into HDMI and turn on HDMI control


 The default is to not pass thru video/audio when receiver is off
 Also the app for putting remote control on your tablet or phone seems to work well

$REVIEW.: Before I begin, I do need to share that my binder is not used in an office location. So, I cannot speak to the durability of this machine due to regular usage in a medium to large office setting. But, I can speak to its convenience and ease of use for a homeschool family that utilizes the machine on a regular basis.I have owned a different binding machine for about ten years for the purpose of binding photo calendars given as Christmas gifts every year. But, I rarely used the machine for anything else because it was not very easy or convenient to use. This Fellowes Quasar 500 is another story. It has completely changed my weekly workload because I have been able to bind a large number of worksheets for my children and give them out in booklet form rather than having to make copies on a weekly basis.Six specific benefits stand out to me with this machine:1) All-in-one: Everything needed to sit down and bind is right there in the binder. A drawer on the bottom of the machine opens to reveal storage space for binding combs and a measuring tool. The tool allows measurement of combs to determine what size you have, and it also allows measurement of a stack of paper to ensure that the selected comb is large enough for the material being bound. The storage compartment of the drawer does not hold many combs, but it does hold enough for those quick jobs of binding one or two books at a time.2) Trash compartment: This compartment is large, allowing a good amount of binding to be done before needing to stop and empty the tray. It is also easy to remove yet secure, lightly snapping in and out of place to practically eliminate the risk of a accidental spill. There is also a window in the front of the binder allowing the user to see when the trash compartment needs to be emptied.3) The claim of punching 20 pages at a time is valid. It does take an extra bit of force to punch through all of the layers, so much so that I was afraid of breaking it at first. But, it's a very sturdy machine, and once I exerted the force, it broke through every page cleanly and evenly. This definitely makes large jobs easy!4) Secure levers. When the binder is picked up and moved, the levers remain securely in place, ensuring that the alignment remains constant.5) There are separate levers for binding and punching. This allows the binding comb to be open and ready to receive the punched sheets. So, when punching a stack that is larger than 20 pages, it is simple to pull the sheets out of the puncher and move them straight onto the comb without them becoming misaligned by being put aside until all of the punching is complete.6) The puncher is vertical instead of horizontal. At first I was skeptical about this, as I expected the paper to fall forward and lose its alignment. But, there is enough depth in the puncher to hold the paper upright, and the open lid gives extra support for the stack of paper from behind. I have rarely had paper fall forward on me. The advantage of this vertical puncher is alignment - the very thing I was concerned about. Gravity itself works with the binder to ensure that the pages all fall neatly into the puncher and therefore are punched evenly. The instances of mis-inserting paper and having the holes come out uneven are greatly decreased with this feature.The one concern I have for future use is the lack of access to the blades themselves. Some of the pages I need to punch are pages that have been run through cold lamination. The laminate is sticky, causing some of the paper to stick to the blades. On my old machine, I needed to clear the blades now and then. My hope is that the paper will either not stick to these blades or that they will clean themselves as I punch regular paper. But, that will remain to be seen. And, it is a very small issue in light of the many benefits of this machine!

$review_text.: I've had this about 2-months and finally worked through the last of my interoperability/interference issues, at an additional cost of almost $500 (gulp!) and probably 20-25 very frustrating hours of researching the issues.1. My 108mhz Netgear WiFi router creates known issues with the SONOS (check their website for compatable routers). Replaced with an Apple Extreme ($175), which works fine. In fact, I was able to hang a Western Digital USB 500mb Hard Drive off the router which seems to work just like a NAS so I can leave my Music library on it instead of a computer. I've only had it installed for a few days, so I can't vouch for it - online research indicates some older USB Hard Drives will go to "sleep" and not be awoken by the SONOS. Time will tell, but right now, it's a cool (and, since I already had the hard drive, thankfully inexpensive) setup.2. Signal between the hardwired Zone Player (note: the 'first' zone player must be hard-wired to your router) and the second Zone Player was apparently too great so I purchased a Zone Bridge ($100 from Best Buy/Magnolia) as a repeater to extend the SONOS network3. The speaker system in my office (the impetus for this little technology journey) has a wireless subwoofer. So I had to ditch the speaker system and replace (another $175)4. 25% of my problems were related to my using a work computer as my primary computer due to some security software my firm runs on all PCs. (BTW - my company is fine with this personal use). These were not issues 95% of the people would face (and they are not specific to SONOS), but I mention it for the other 5%). Also, I had originally tried the Logitech Touch (the new one) and also had compatibility issues - they are less difficult with the SONOS than the Logitech for some reason. For the extra $500, I think the SONOS is a better deal than the Logitech, but that's just me.On the plus side, now that I have the system up and going, I love it. The SONOS website has a forum that is incredibly quick and helpful. On the minus side, I spent aboout $1000 on the original bundle, and another $500 and lots of time getting it going so while I will continue extending my SONOS network, I would not recommend it to a non-tech savvy friend. I'm fairly technical, and this was hardly plug-and-play for me.

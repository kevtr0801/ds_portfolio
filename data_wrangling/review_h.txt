$review_text.: This Sigma lens, which I have had since November 2008 has been great from the very beginning. I paid around $370 for the lens, compared to over $600 for the equivalent Canon lens. Even though price was a consideration when buying this lens, I first looked up different lens reviews in magazine and at internet sites. Most of the reviews concluded that the Sigma lens was, for the most part, equivalent, or even better than the Canon lens. I photograph portraits and weddings all year long and I have always been very satisfied with the sharpness and the color hues in this lens. Many people believe that a brand name lens (Canon, Nikon) is always better and more rugged than an independent brand. Judging from my experience with this brand, SIGMA lenses (I have three Sigmas) have always been of top quality.
$SUMMARY.: Ideal lens

$review_text.: If you are just running a standard system (not a higher end performance machine) and just need a quick and cheap replacement so far this has worked fine,  though I would not count on the same life expectancy as from one of the more quality models


 If you are running a performance machine you do not want lower end PSU (power supplies) as the power needs of those systems are much more demanding and specific


 It has all the standard selection of cables like any other psu and they are of adequate quality
 So, for most folks this will be more than adequate and easy on the budget.UPDATE - 1/31/12  Had to submit to Amazon for replacement as this one burned out pretty fast
 Amazon immediately sent replacement even two months later, thank you Amazon.UPDATE - 10/10/12 The one they replaced 9 months ago has now burned out, thats 3 in about 1 year

 Simply not worth the effort, better to spend a bit more and get a little quality.

 I purchased this bag for its light weight, but have found that it has a lot of good features
 You can transfer your entire wallet to one of the zippered compartments, and somehow there is room for everything you need in the main compartment
 This is a great bag for anyone interested in convenience and something that won't weigh you down.

$REVIEW.: Okay, let me get this out there. I hoard backpacks the way some ladies hoard shoes. I work internationally and travel 6 - 7 months out of the year so I am ALWAYS on the look out for a bigger, better pack. I'll start with the good...:This pack has a TON of room. And I do mean a ton. From the 17&#34; RSS (more on this later) laptop sleeve to the dedicated tablet / e - reader pouch; this bag literally has room for all of my gizmos. I travel with....10. Pelican case for SD cards and SIM cards1. iPod Classic2. Galaxy SIII3. 3 portable HDs4. Bose Soundlink Mini5. Sweatshirt6. Beats by Dr Dre Studio Noise Canceling Headphones7. 15&#34; Dell laptop8. Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 in Otterbox9. Kindle10. Pelican case for SD and SIM cards11. Passport12. ID badges with several lanyards13. Mini Dopp kit14. All the chargers and cables for the above electronics15. Spare t shirt, socks and boxers16. Wet Wipes17. Various doodads and knick knacks (pens, batteries glasses screwdriver, spare change, Burt's Bees, etc...)Does everything fit? Yep. With room to spare. I cannot begin to tell you how much of a relief it is to be able to fit all of this and still have some wiggle room if I see something in the airport I can't live without.Now, what is an RSS you ask? Why it's a Reactive Suspension System... It's a padded laptop sleeve that have some bounce to it but keep your laptop off the bottom of your pack. I have a 15&#34;, but can tell by the room left over (enough to fit my charging cable and wireless mouse) that there is more than enough room for a 17&#34;. I can't say if this RSS works beyond a shadow of a doubt, but I'm pretty rough with my bag  and my laptop remains intact!The kicker and icing on the cake to me at least, is the ridgid sunglasses case on the top of the bag. It doesn't affect my storage capacity and offers enough room for my Oakley Gascans, regular glasses and a nice big microfiber cloth.Now onto the big one star detraction....This bag is heavy empty. Noticeably heavier than any of my other bags. You can imagine the weight when it is full. Not a huge deal, but a bit of a pain in the tush when you're traveling internationally and face some extended layovers and huge airports. The weight in and of itself is not a huge issue, but the straps... Man the straps... They are narrow and don't have a lot of padding. I actually got some tingling in my fingers after about 30 minutes of wearing this. It DOES have a chest strap, but the benefits of the chest strap are overshadowed by the total lack of comfort that these straps provide.As other have mentioned, the adjustment buckles for the straps are the Achilles Heel of this bag. They don't hold the desired position with any weight at all in the bag. I actually just leave them fully extended now.So, if Ogio happens to read this... Thicker straps with more padding and rugged adjustment buckles that are up to the task and you'll have THE Perfect Travel Backpack.Yes, I would buy this again as it is the closest thing to a perfect bag that I have found, but I am still looking....

$REVIEW.: Headphone reviews are naturally subjective. What sounds good to one person may not satisfy another. For example, look at the reviews for almost any headphone here on Amazon and you will see complaints about "too much bass" and "no bass at all" for the same model. I would always try to demo the unit I am considering, if possible.As for the 558's, the large, high quality drivers and open backed design of these cans make for an extremely revealing sound with all genres. The treble and midrange are clean, sophisticated and non fatiguing, even at high volumes. There is plenty of bass, at least to my ears, and the bass is textured and punchy, unlike some "super-bass" headphones which produce a flatulent, one dimensional sound. These phones project a spacious and detailed soundstage, making them a good choice for games and movies as well as music. To me, the only worthy competitor in this price range are the Grado SR-80's. The Grados can produce a more exciting, dynamic sound with some music but I find them to be a little harsh and aggressive at higher volumes. The 558's are far more comfortable for extended listening than the Grados as well. Both are excellent choices, but I have to give the nod to the Senn's as the better all around-er. As always, your mileage may vary. Buy these from an authorized dealer (like Amazon).

$REVIEW.: I purchased this motherboard as part of a system rebuild of my aging (15 year old) PC that was still running Windows XP (and 98 - don't laugh).  I have since installed Windows 8.1 evaluation (Enterprise edition) which is free for 90 days but cannot be upgraded to a permanent license, mainly to see if I would run into any problems, if it would fail to recognize legacy hardware, and most importantly, if I would dislike the new operating system.  I can say for certain that the rebuild and installation of this evaluation copy of Windows 8.1 went almost without incident with all hardware being recognized (even installed my networked Brother MFC J870DW printer/scanner without a problem).  I am also getting quite used to the new interface and plan to obtain a copy of Windows 8.1 Professional to install with a permanent license key.  For those who may be interested, I also purchased a Kingston HyperX Blu 8GB memory module along with an AMD Sempron 145 processor where I currently have the processor unlocked to a dual core (some minor issues but can live with them).  So far, the motherboard seems to work quite well.  I don't use my PC for gaming, so the integrated ATI Radeon 3000 graphics works well as does the integrated audio and Ethernet port.  Since my old system (PIII 500 with AGP graphics) was so slow compared to what I have now, I really noticed the difference - worth the price since I didn't want to spend a lot on newer hardware.

$review_text.: Note that this receiver is only good to make your back speakers wireless from your front speakers

The back two speakers must still be wired together (and to this receiver)


We didn't realize that when we bought the receiver, fortunately it worked for our living room layout anyway.95% of the time, this receiver works perfectly

The other 5% of the time it seems really picky


The signal needs an almost direct line of sight to the surround sound box and because of this we have to have the box in a very conspicuous spot
We purchased shelves and hung these about 1.5-2 feet down from the ceiling, put the speakers and receiver on them, and it seemed to have taken care of the issue
Otherwise, if things like a pillow or the arm of a couch get in the way, it cuts out every minute or so and says "Rear Speaker Check."So if you have the right set up and know you have exactly what this works for, this item is great

Just make sure it will work for you before you buy it!

The 1080p is hardly necessary in this size-screen for watching TV, but it is very useful as a computer monitor because it allows more information to be diplayed at once and decreased the need to page-down for internet news stories, PDF files, and other documents.The sound seems more than adequate for a TV.

As a result, I bought another for me and some for family and friends who have trailers.  The device not only lists the voltage but it gives an idea of the amount of charge left.  This is very helpful when you are trolling but it is also helpful so that I know how much time I have before my trailer battery needs to be charged.

$review_text.: I love this PDA!  I will not rehash the technical specs everyone else has already talked about, but I would like to mention what I consider its most notable features, both pro/com:(1) Very small and sleek.  Easily fits in even a small pocket without bulging.  Reasonable minds may differ, but the size and weight differences between the 1910 and my previous PDA (an iPaq 3650) and my wife's PDA (one of the new Jornadas) is *very* noticeable in day-to-day use.(2) Decent speed/memory.  Frankly, I sort of wish that the 1910 had one of the faster (300-400 MHz) processors.  But in actual use I find it to be plenty fast for the uses I actually put it to.  E.g., I can listen to MP3s using Media Player while surfing with Internet Explorer at the same time.  I got used to the speed of my old 3650, and this one is approximately the same.(3) Expandability.  I bought an inexpensive 256 MB SD card for my 1910 and now I use it as a portable MP3 player (six albums stored in 96 bps WMA format) and photo album.  Nice touch.  Also frees up main memory for running applications, which keeps its overall execution speed up.(4) No cover.  This is something I am not entirely happy with.  On the one hand, no cover/case means a smaller and lighter unit, which is good.  On the other hand, no cover means no screen protection, e.g., when leaving it in my pocket playing MP3s, or when rattling around inside my briefcase.  I think all in all I would have liked HP to include some sort of screen cover (like in its Jornada series) or at least an inexpensive basic leather(ette) case.(5) No frills.  No built-in wireless, no built-in camera, etc.  If had wanted that stuff I would have bought a larger and more expensive model.  But for what I use a PDA for (scheduling, contacts, cached Internet browsing and MP3 playing) the 1910 does it all; and I get to pocket a savings of a lot of money that I didn't want to spend on frills I would seldom if ever use.

$REVIEW.: The cost has gone from 385 to 436 (+13%) in one day (shipping included).This is a replacement for a similar new Lenovo Lenovo 4334-EGU G570 that came with a broken WiFi adapter and whose hard drive failed after a couple of hours. This 43302AU model has a faster 2nd generation i3 processor. Most laptops being sold now with an i3 now have the 3rd generation i3 CPU. This must be a leftover model.THIS LENOVO *ALSO* CAME WITH A BROKEN WIFI ADAPTER. This is certainly not this vendor's fault. Both models came with a 320GB Caviar Blue 5400 rpm hard drive. WD is probably the most reliable hard drive manufacturer, or at least tied at top place with Toshiba hard drives, so I consider the first laptop's hard drive failure as just an infrequent fluke.Instead of sending the whole laptop back to its vendor *again*, I called up Lenovo customer support and got them to send me a box with free shipping to send just the wifi adapter back for a free replacement. The wifi adapter card measures 1.5 inches by 1 inch. Lenovo sent me a 22 inch by 15 inch laptop shipping box !  It barely fit into the FedEx mailbox. An alternative would be to give Lenovo an 80 dollar loan paying no interest for 6 to 12 weeks in order for them to first send me a 10 buck replacement wifi adapter. I would then send the broken adapter back to them and eventually get my money back.I bought a compatible Intel wifi adapter. It worked for about 2 hours and then failed in the same manner. (Win 7 networking said they were connected to the router, but no data would transfer.)  I'm wondering if the Lenovo wifi adapter slots are mis-designed and actually burn out any model of wifi adapter. I'll have to wait to see what happens to Lenovo's replacement..

$review_text.: Lowepro has the good reputaion on camera bags, but first I was very concerned about the size too small for Canon 60D & 18-135mm lens, while I didn't want a big toploader. After reading everybody's reviews here, I was convinced that it should work and I have given a try. Wow, it worked. It's big enough for the camera, or it may be a little tight to somebody else. For me, it is the perfect size. I can put my extra battery and hood in the front pocket, and memory cards inside the lid pocket. If I fly, it can be put in my suitcase or backpack. When the weather is bad, I can easily take pictures and put camera back to it for good protection. For light travellers, it's highly recommended to have this bag for Canon 60D.Update: I can carry 2 lenses: one with the camera in the bag, and another one like 70-300mm in lens bag attached. I can put 60D & 17-55mm F2.8 lens inside. I thought, only Tamron or Sigma 17-50mm f2.8 lens  would fit, and I really wanted to use it to carry my new general purpose lens. Glad to find out that I was wrong.
$review_summary.: Good for Canon 60D & 18-135mm lens

$REVIEW.: I switched from the GS series to the HX series, and this and the 1050 are bar none, the best PSU's out there. They run cool and are very stable even under load. I also love the fact that you only have to connect the cables you need other than the 8 pin CPU plug and the 24 pin board plug which are attached. I am now willing to pay the extra price over the GS series, because I don't have to hide all of those extra cables. These units are also very well built, come in nice packaging and very heavy.Dale in Texas

$review_text.: I particularly like this cord for two reasons.1) The angled connector is perfect for the audio port on my pickup as it immediately directs the cable down and of the way. Mute point for newer cars that use USB or Bluetooth.2) The straight end it narrow enough to work with my phone case. Where as many cables are two thick to fit thru a typical headphone port on some cell phone cases.

$review_text.: Everything about the iCar Charger 1000 is awesome on paper. Integrated aux cable, long, thick cable, controls on the charger, and the idea of plugging in just one connector to charge your iPhone AND play it. Unfortunately, Monster dropped the ball in a huge way.After about three minutes of successfully playing and charging, it will either stop charging or stop playing audio. To start it up again, you have to unplug the connector and plug it back in. It doesn't sound like that much trouble, but doing it every three minutes get old very fast.For what it's worth, I didn't experience any hum or buzzing in my Honda Fit, or Element. Just terrible, terrible connection issues.Despite the price being reduced to $9.95 (from $70), this device is not worth ANY amount of your time or money. Find something else.

$review_text.: I had a bad prior experience with Seagate, including situations where I had drives fail in the first week. But they seem to have improved their reliability, at this in this backup plus line.I already have another backup plus drive (2TB Windows version), so I might have a comparison. Both look very similar: Windows version is almost all black, while this one has a silver center. They the exact same software inside: both Windows and Mac OS versions included together. Both came with the same power adapter and USB3.0 cable, and both transfer at similar speeds: 60MB/s write on average in my trials.The only difference is the drive format. This obviously comes formatted in HFS+, while Windows version was NTFS.  Since HFS+ is not supported natively on Windows, Seagate provides a driver on their web site, which is actually a special version of Paragon HFS software (normally a separate $19 cost). After installing that driver (and a reboot), it also worked perfectly in Windows. I even tried it under Linux, and drive works there as well.So this is a relatively fast (but remember it's 5400K), reliable, backup oriented drive at an affordable price. It does not matter which version you get (Mac or Windows), the only difference would be the casing.

After I had this problem and my wireless internet stopped working, I tried upgrading the firmware to DD-WRT but that made it worse so I tried changing the firmware back to the latest linksys build but it still won't broadcast the internet. (I can see and connect to the network it creates, but the internet doesn't work even when I'm connected.) I'm done trying to troubleshoot this stupid thing and will never buy this model again.

$REVIEW.: First off, after reading so many reviews for the Sharp 70" which I was so close to buying, I decided to go $1-200 cheaper than the cheapest Sharp model in the 70" lineup and buy the Vizio.  I've always wanted to try Vizio because I've heard a lot of good things about them so I did after finding that this was only about 1 of 3 or 4 of the total 70" LCDs on the market from which to choose.  My choices were very limited.  I read much good and much bad about the Sharp image.  So, after reading about the Vizio and finding less negatives for their model than for the Sharp, I went with Vizio.Sharp apparently has issues with the big ones that actually require professionals to come to the house to calibrate the image because buyers just can't make it look good no matter what they do.  Many of those complaining about this were seemingly "qualified" to make the adjustments, having such extensive experience with LCDs.  Also, I don't know what Sharp is doing with their model numbers but I swear, I had to (with a fine-tooth comb mind you) painstakingly go through the exact specifications of each of the models, and I think there were like 8 70" Sharp models to go through at rather dramatically different price points.  Reading reviews for each, each had their own unique image issues even though they all had the same comments regarding not being able to adjust the picture to look good at all.  By the time I was done with hours and hours of research over about 2 weeks, I basically gave up.  That's why I was so happy to find the 70" Vizio.I may provide updates in the future.  I've only had the TV running for about a week so I can only comment on so much at this point.  If you have questions for me, or if you want me to test something for you, post a message and I'll reply.On CNET I read that the smaller version of this TV, the 60", likely performs worse that the 70" because they fixed an issue the 70" models that existed in the 60".  They complained a lot about blacks not being true.  That's important to me but I kept the faith and went with it anyway.  Well, I'm not dissatisfied with the blacks at all.  I keep my backlight at 100, contrast at 90 and brightness at 30 for a deep but very bright, excellently contrasted picture, and this helps the blacks be almost true.  However, if I turn these setting higher, blacks are just a very dark gray so this may or may not apply to you depending upon the settings.My only complaint is about the white.  This complaint would in NO WAY influence my decision to buy this Vizio, but it does exist and I think it's more of a size issue because I noticed the same thing on the Sharps when comparing them side by side in Best Buy.  The 60" Sharp had the best pure white and was very bright.  The 70" Sharp that I contemplated buying showed white as a very light blue that's just a hue, like the bluish you might see while looking at white glaciers.  It was noticeably dimmer than the 60" Sharp.  The 80" Sharp cinemawide was the dimmest with the greatest bluish hue whites.  I would not buy that one.  The picture just isn't good enough.I have the 70" Vizio side by side with the 37" Samsung running the same shows and the Samsung white is white (snow for instance was pure white on Samsung, bluish hue on Vizio).  Given the Samsung's smaller size though, and, if the blueish hue is the result of the large size of the TV and edge-lit technology, that would make sense.  I even turned the contrast, backlighting, and brightness to 100% on the Vizio and it was still bluish.  However, oddly enough, while playing my PS3, I noticed that the whites were pure!  Explain that!  There goes anything that might cause the bluish hue to come from size (but it still seems apparent to me that size causes dimness, perhaps more so with the newer edge-lit technology).  I don't know.  I'm not an expert but after seeing all of the different things that can impact picture quality, I'm almost left with the thought, why bother?  You've got the following things weighing in to what you're trying to compare: Screen size, picture settings, each TVs built-in technology (60 vs. 120Hz, 720i vs. 720p vs. 1080i vs. 1080p), whether the channel is in HD, what the program you're watching is shot in (non-HD, 720, 1080), streaming vs. non-streaming content (Netflix, Hulu, On Demand, etc.), bandwidth speed and the quality of your wired/wireless connection, whether on a gaming system or watching any of the above forms of programming, and the list goes on and on.Here are the settings on both the Vizio and Samsung I've been comparing 24/7:Backlight: 100Contrast: 90Brightness: 30Color: 50Tint: +5 on Vizio, 0 on Samsung in order to make skin tones and other colors match on both TVsSharpness: 100 (not always possible depending upon the channel and program where it's just too grainy)Noise Reduction: LowAfter seeing and researching all of this, and since it's impossible to compare apples with apples if you have the chance to do so when comparing TVs of different sizes, brands, technologies etc., I've come to the conclusion that you should just buy what you like after seeing it in person.  I never saw the Vizio before I bought it but it's the best advice I can give in my opinion (I took a chance that paid off so far).  Even when I change channels from HD to standard, some look horrible (even on the Samsung), and some look fantastic.  How do you know what's supposed to look good when you have no idea what each channel change is going to do to your image?  I would say on average, every other channel I change looks better on the other TV.  Samsung excels in whites, and the Vizio seems to be more colorful and sharp in many programs.Other than that, although it's a smart TV with built-in wi-fi, there's no browser.  It only has apps but a good selection: YouTube, Hulu, a Yahoo suite, Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, Rhapsody, Vudu, twitter, and Facebook.  And other than that, for some reason, the menu is somewhat blurry even with the sharpness at 100.  Strange but I really don't care since the actual picture doesn't look like that.  I don't nit-pick on remote controls and ease of menu navigation.  They work fine and the flip-over qwerty keyboard on the remote also works well.  I have no other complaints at all so far.So the question is, am I happy with it so far?  YES.  Very happy for $1699, with the only issue being the white.  I was a little upset to see it was offered at Costco for $1499 though!  I thought I go the best deal in town :(Anyway, if you're really anal about detailed specifics in picture quality and whatnot, knock yourself out trying to determine what to buy.  After this experience I'm done with all of it.  Support a company that you know is established, tried and true, which you've had good experience with in the past, see and compare the images in person before buying (even if you ultimately buy it online) and buy from them.Again, I'd be happy to set up tests for you with your own settings and give you my opinion.  Hope I've made your research easier, and happy shopping!-

I now have it hooked up to both my television screen and internet so I can view the cameras on my phone from anywhere. I have 3 cameras hooked up and set to record non-stop, and the usage appears to be roughly 1% of the hard drive per day. Menu is easy to use.I don't like that when using the remote or pressing buttons on the DVR it makes a loud obnoxious beep, and I'm not sure if there is a way to disable that. I have yet to try and transfer the video to a backup device. So far I'm very satisfied.

$REVIEW.: After replacing the included hard drive in my Sony PS3 with a 320GB unit, I needed a simple and reliable enclosure install the now un-used hard drive to use elsewhere. This hard drive enclosure is a perfect fit for any of the PS3 hard drives (80GB, in my case), and requires nothing extra to work with any PC as a back-up.My enclosure (the StarTech SAT2510U2) fit together perfectly (small screw holes, that is) with no problems and attatching it to the old PS3 hard drive was very easy. The enclosure stays cool to the touch after prolonged use, and I only use one plug of the included Y-shaped USB cable to power it thru my PC.In all, a sure-fire easy to assemble/install/use enclosure for anyone needing to use their swapped out PS3 hard drives elsewhere.

$REVIEW.: I have had this video camera for some time now, so I have had time to "feel out" the pros and cons.Pro-The camera is small, light, and has fairly well placed buttons.The video is really nice quality, 1080i (according to another review) is fine for me.It takes pretty good pictures, but not the best (it IS a video camera).The battery life is good, but if you like taking lots of video, get a couple of batteries and an external charger.Zoom, great!Easy access to memory, charging, output ports, and battery release.The learning curve for the additional features a not bad. I have figured many things out just by fiddling with it.Cons-Can be TOO small.  It is sometimes hard to operate it is so small.Man, this thing does a lot of stuff I just don't need, requiring time to figure out how to use it properly!  (Couldn't they just have a "point and shoot" preset?)The light is so weak and harsh it is stupid. It would have been better just to have a "hot-shoe" and lighting accessories.The touch screen concept, while necessary, is just plain silly.Sometimes, the buttons you NEED to push are very difficult to actually press in.FINALLY, my biggest complaint and the reason I gave this 3 stars as opposed to 4, AVCHD stinks!!!  Keep in mind, this is a PROFESSIONAL format, so it necessarily makes things more complicated!I think it should be law that if a video, audio, or camera company uses a proprietary format in it's equipment, it should be REQUIRED to include conversion software for PC AND MACs.At the very least, it should offer software cheap or give suggestions as to which software will convert the thing to a format people can use!!!So if you are looking for good, small, video camera and have all Panasonic equipment, or you want to spend more money and time on conversion software, GREAT!But if you want to easily show other people your video creations in a format that doesn't require you to buy conversion software and jump through hoops, I would look elsewhere!Oh, AVCHD was developed with Sony, so pay attention when you look at those HD Camcorders as well.  It kind of figures, doesn't it?  Sony and Panasonic being proprietary?(I'm just sayin')

$review_text.: I have seldom reviewed products. Mostly because I am open to give some leeway to a piece of technology when they malfunction. However, I have been tested with this piece of junk for the past 9 months.IF and when the player works, it works good. But mostly you will be saddled with freeze frames, out of sync audio or plain boot up failures. Loud hums and mechanical noises are also a norm. If you think and hope a firmware upgrade will resolve issues, please read the reviews to find that the upgrades have mostly ADDED to the problems!If you are out of the measly 90 day parts and labor warranty, you need to pay to ship the unit out to their service center, and also pay for the labor. Samsung generously covers the cost of the parts! 'smirk'. The cost of labor will almost get you another player! As many have reported, their 'serviced' returns are mostly worse off, than before the unit was sent to them.Folks, this is a genuine LEMON. So please spare yourself heartaches and  headaches, and spend your money on a player from another maker. Samsung makes great TV's but blu ray player...naah! Amazon should really take this product off it's shelves. It must be costing them more to ship out replacements!Feel free to ignore the warnings and buy this player. But do yourself one last favor before you buy this. Read the rants of others who have ignored the warnings, and thought they might get lucky with a problem free player. You may not be the lucky one...just a thought.

$REVIEW.: I've had this for a couple years now and absolutely love it
It is VERY loud and pretty versatile


I also purchased the Altec Lansing M650 last year too


The M650 has a better sound quality but is very quiet compared to this one

It depends on what you're using it for

I use this one for outside pool party's and out on the boat..


But I use the M650 for inside the house or a small bonfire because the quality is better, and it has a mini-sub that sounds amazing


Another A+ Product from Altec Lansing!

These actually are very close to being better then the Bose headphones.  My pros and cons list is against the Bose.Pros:Sound deadening designwind deadeninggreat bassgreat controls for Apple productslouder then BoseCons:Controls don't work with a lot of other productsnot quite the same high and mid quality of Bosesound transfer through chordI have a pretty good ear and the areas that these are not better then the Bose are in some of the mids and highs, but the bass is better.  Another thing I have noticed is the bass gets so much better they deeper they are in your ear canal.I really like these and will probably buy the next model up from these to see if I like them even more.Edited:  I have had these about two months now and they are holding up great with little to no show of wear.

 i didnt have any use for the screen protector as i already have ghost armor on my itouch, but the home charger and extra usb cord were a nice addition that i can take with me on the road

 the car charger is the reason i only gave it 4 stars

 the construction is VERY poor and it heated up to a point where i was uncomfortable with having it plugged in my car...and this was only after 10-15 minutes


 overall, the kit exceeded my expectations and for only $6+ (including shipping)...you can't go wrong with it.

$REVIEW.: Lamp was a direct replacement, and you can't beat the price. I received the lamp in two days. Took me 10 minutes to replace from start to finish. The connection on the side of the lamp is not like the original. It makes it hard to reattach that wire. The screw on the replacement lamp is smaller and is a square drive not a Phillips. So make sure you have a square drive bit before you start the project.Note: 10/09/11 Lamp lasted for five days then blew up like a fire cracker. I will RTV and see if they send a replacement. If they do I will edit this review and relate my experience. I will go tomorrow and purchase an original Mitsubishi lamp and housing. I wish I would have done that in the first place.Final Note:10/25/11 Recieved warranty replacement lamp today. The company has very good customer service and the new lamp was promptly sent out at no charge to me. Since I had already purchased an original equipment lamp and housing assembly after the first one went out. I just installed this lamp in the old housing and will keep it for a spare.

$review_text.: This is a waste of time and money.  The package contained the screen guard but nothing else, not even instructions.  I went to the website and reviewed the installation instructions.  The instructions state to lift dust off the iPad using the &#34;dust film&#34; (I did not receive this but I thoroughly cleaned my iPad with a a microfiber cloth).  This film was so sticky and seemed to magnetically attract dust.  I tried applying it and reapplying it multiple times and it did not line up correctly.  In addition, it collected so much dust during the process that it was useless.  Re:  Lifetime guarantee?  I emailed Sir Lancelot's and the response was when we receive your returned screen proector we will contact you to offer you a refund or a replacement.  Are they kidding?  First of all, the item was missing parts  (bubble card, instructions, and dust film).  I'm supposed to package up and mail a useless Item I purchased for $6.95?  Then, I wait until they contact me after my return is received to find out if I want a replacement or a refund?  Then if I chose a replacement, I have to wait even longer to receive it?  With the Tech Armor guarantee, they immediately ship out a replacement (no need to ship back an unusable item) and in my case they threw in an extra product!  I will not be giving Sir Lacelot my money again,

It's probably as good as any of the other cheap bottom tier tripods.  Just don't think you are getting $150 quality for $20 bucks.  If you just want something for indoor or occasional use, this will probably do the trick.  If your going to be dragging in into the woods and mountains, you may want to go with something a bit more rugged -- or you could buy 4 or 5 of these and just throw them away as they break.

Although there is software tilt correction, this did not produce satisfactory viewing results for me.This monitor is fast for gaming, and the colors are vivid


If you are using a wall bracket, you will not have the tilt problem.Because Samsung did not design it to sit properly on a flat surface, and I cannot get a good viewing angle in my set-up due to this forward tilt, I knock off one star.~~>> "I want to die peacefully in my sleep, like my grandfather

$review_text.: My wife and I were looking for something to replace our aging DV camcorder, and decided to step up to HD.Since we've been happy with ourCanon Digital Rebel XSi SLR, and the XTi before it, Canon seemed the logical choice.The biggest obstacle in choosing a new camera was deciding between the HG20 and theCanon VIXIA HF10. After a ton of research, we found that the HG20 and HG10 are basically the same camera. The HG20 has a 60GB hard drive, the HG10 has 16MB flash. Beyond that, the optics and Digic processors are the same (though the HG20 is capable of recording at a higher bitrate, due to the hard drive).Since the HG20 gives you the option of writing to SDHC cards, it seemed a better value.We've had the camera for just over a week now, and the image quality is generally outstanding. In low light, the HG20 produces an acceptable picture, though it is a bit grainy and "digital" looking. With adequate light though, the picture is outstanding.The image stabilization works better than expected, especially when you're zoomed in, but keep in mind that this is the primary reason it's there. If you have jittery hands and aren't giving some thought to what you're shooting, you're still going to produce movies that look like they came from any old camcorder.Taking still pictures is reasonably easy, and the camera's ability to focus and take a decent photo at full zoom is incredible. However, if you have a digital camera that's less than three years old, it's probably going to take better pictures. This is definitely a "nice to have" feature, but you shouldn't go in to this expecting it to replace a point-and-shoot digital camera.If you're familiar with Canon Digital Rebel, PowerShot, or Elph cameras, the menus on the HG20 will make perfect sense to you. All of the settings are where you'd expect them to be. And if you're not familiar with other Canon products, learning the menu system is quite easy.Now, some caveats...Right off the bat, editing AVCHD video is going to pound on your computer. If you're using a Mac, a current-generation MacBook Pro is probably the minimum you'd want to use for any sort of editing. On the bright side, iMovie 08 (and 09) will see this camera and do its thing without any hiccups. But actually getting a full-res movie from the camera to your computer is only marginally faster than DV (to those who may be confused: it takes about as long to import the video as it does to play it).The next issue -- which is true for so many Canon products -- the Genuine Canon accessories are ridiculously expensive. Unlike their digital cameras to date, a third party battery isn't going to work 100% properly in the HG20. So if you're not prepared to deal with not knowing the "real" charge on your battery, plan on spending more for a battery. The included battery claims to get about 108 minutes on a full charge. Step up to theCanon BP-819 Lithium Ion Battery Pack, and you'll get in the high 200's without having a massive battery pack jutting out of the back of the camcorder.On a similar tangent, a big irritation for me is that you have to connect the camera to wall power to import video to your computer. If you're planning on going on the road with your camera and laptop, you might want to look at a power inverter for your car. Otherwise, you're not dumping video until you get home (or somewhere with an outlet).That said, there are some universal accessories you can pick up without breaking the bank. I own these all, and can confirm that they work just fine with the HG20:Tripp Lite Mini-HDMI to HDMI Cable (6 feet)Lowepro - Edit 140(Note: this bag is just about perfect for the HG20's size, and can hold all of the included accessories, as well as an HDMI cable and two filters)Sunpak CF-7026 UV 37mm Ultra-Violet FilterSunpak CF-7051 CP Circular Polarized Filters 37mmNow that the 2009 models are out, you can pick the HG20 up for an excellent price. Considering the features and picture quality, the camera is a great value. And as long as you go in to it knowing you're going to need to spend some more money for accessories (or computer upgrades, video editing software, etc.) you won't be disappointed.
$SUMMARY.: Great video quality, but at a price.

Connections would take a long time and would fail periodically. The fastest speed it would connect at, only two rooms away was 24Meg.  Sometimes it would connect at 36Meg but quickly drop back down, sometimes to 10Meg.  Someone around my house is running an unsecured WLAN as the card in my PC would get a week signal and pick up in IP address from somewhere else. Oops.  I had to configure the PC end to look for my network only.  If you follow Linksys's instructions, it will us the default configuration, which is wide open, and leave your network assessable to anyone around you.  I soon tired of messing with it and got an RMA and shipped it back.  I'll wait for 802.11a's prices to come down or see what new wireless protocol comes out next week.

$review_text.: I was a skeptic on buying this receiver.  It fit in the price range I was looking for, the specs were good, but some of the reviews I read were bad.  It was either this or the much higher priced NR717.  Mine did come with the newer firmware, but I cannot recall the version offhand.I have only had one issue with this receiver thus far, and it is when I switch from the cable box to my HTPC computer.  I get a slight hum and I either have to reboot the PC or sometimes switching from PC to something else and back will solve the issue.  At first I thought it was a videocard/sound issue (sound comes in over HDMI) but after trying a different videocard, I had similar issues.  I knocked a star off for this as its not game breaking, but is an annoyance.Other than this,  its been a great receiver powering a pair of Polk Audio speakers as I do not use a surround sound setup yet.

$REVIEW.: Just took this to Italy.  It was just great for driving. Option for selecting "truck" versus a car keeps you off the smallest streets, a plus if you are not used and do not care to drive the small windy roads in the mountains or within cities. You can also insert a waypoint to avoid or bypass certain areas.  Very up to date.  Only a few new intersections or rods were not mapped.  In the "pedestrian" mode, you can use it to  wander a city, after marking your parking place.  One problem is the slight ambiguity of which way to start, when walking.  A north arrow would be good.  Also, the battery will run out if used continually for a few hours  of walking, so be careful.  Be sure to have the 12 volt charger for the car.  Other than those two issues, it was absolutly great.The Fedor Europe addition was pretty good, but not must. Overall, I would not go without it.  I also use it extensively in the US, as I travel often.

$review_text.: I needed a new monitor - I work a lot from home and I needed more real estate.  I didn't have a ton of money to spend.  After looking around, I settled on this Asus model.  It's perfect.  It VESA mounts so I can use my arm mount to keep my desk clear.  Not a single dead pixel.  It's been great for gaming.I'm not a tech expert when it comes to monitors.  I can't tell you how many teraflops it has, or how to grease its exhaust bearings.  I know that I do a ton of Excel on this monitor during the day, and game on it in the evening, and the results have been quite pleasing.

$REVIEW.: I have been using Crucial&#8217;s m550 model for a while and very satisfied with it. It has not been over a year yet, but I am not noticing decreased speed or lagging.This one, according to my quick research, is the world first 16nm SSD with MLC (256 GB version) and still offers low per GB price for the majority of consumers. These days I am seeing fast decreasing in SSD prices (especially 240+ GB ones), and I found this one go around or under $100 when offered with a mail in rebate. Having said that, I think, this is good time to try on the SSDs if you haven&#8217;t. The short booting time, incredible reading and writing speed, makes the whole personal computing experience very different from the spindle drives. I already swapped my main drive to Crucial&#8217;s m550 in my Macbook Pro, so I put this one as a second SSD (replaced ODD using cheap data doubler). During the process, I had no issues, and the drive is now working hard very quietly. Now my MBP is cooler and quieter than ever, and I love the fact that I have enough storage space in my laptop with the fastest speed and low power consumption (less heat).The box comes with a 7mm to 9.5mm spacer and a key code for Acronis True Image HD 2014 application. Also, this drive includes 3 year warranty which is good enough for the life of the SSD. FYI, the endurance of this drive is rated at 72TB TBW(total bytes written), and that&#8217;s equal to 40 GB /day for five years.Overall, this is still very good SSD, only the writing speed lags little bit compared to the some others. However, this SSD offers efficiency and affordability for the mainstream personal computing consumers. Around $100 for 256GB SSD is really good buy and worth try now. Probably in three years, these might get dirt cheap, but for now, this is the affordable and reliable SSD solution.

Depending on what kind of processor you use it on, the large 12g tube lasts quite awhile.  If you're only doing a few computers, it'd probably best to get the smaller size, although as far as I can tell, it never goes bad, I have some tubes I've had for 5+ years, and it seems a little thicker (maybe it was a different formula?) but works great just the same.Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: I found this to be a relatively speedy and compatible drive with both Mac (of course) and PC.  I did not use the included software long enough to encounter any problems, and I reformatted it, so I am mostly talking hardware compatability.I liked the idea that you can remove the adapter and replace it with another, say like a USB 3.0 or Thunderbolt.  This would allow you to used this across a wide variety of new and old machines as well as Mac and PC.  Unfortunately, I found it impossible to find the adapters by themselves.  So, in reality, it is practically just a USB 2.0 drive.  I take off 1 star for this.However, once you remove the adapter, it is just an exposed SATA connector.  Although the drive-side SATA is inset, so you can't really do much with it, the adapter SATA is a full-on portable SATA-to-USB 2.0 adapter.  Very clever.  I plugged it into a bare Intel SSD I had lying around, and it worked perfectly (see customer pictures).  I give it back one star for this cool ability.Next, I also have the PC version of this drive (which is a USB 3.0 BTW).  If you are wondering what you get for the "Mac premium", the Mac version is made with a nicer aluminum case cover with real raised/machined logo whereas the PC version is just plastic with a painted logo.  So, it would seem you are getting something extra, except that the aluminum cover is held on with cheap double-sided tape, and it won't stay down.  Mine had an unsightly gap along one side.  See customer pictures.  Additionally, when I plugged the USB 3.0 interface from the PC version in, although it worked, the adapter did not align correctly and looked "unfinished/crooked" while at the same time, the silver cases of both (one aluminum and one plastic) did not match very well at all.So, reality is this is a fine drive if you don't plan to change the adapters.  Consider the adapter as an emergency-use-only bonus kind of deal.  If you want to avoid the gap (and save money), it's probably better to get the PC version.BTW, inside, it is a Samsung M5 drive.  Hope you found my review useful :)

$review_text.: I have been using Dell machines now for more than 14 years and each one of them has been a pleasure to use. It is the same in the present case also.The machine is sleek, robust and easy to use. Of course, laptops are increasingly coming without DVD drives and this one does not have one. It seems that they have some variations in this model and some of my friends were able to buy them with DVDs. Since this one on Amazon does not have a DVD player, you need to decide whether it would suit your purpose or not.Windows 8 might give some difficulty to new users, but that is more of a learning problem and less of a computer problem. Each version of Windows creates this kind of learning problem, and it is a bit higher with Windows 8 or 8.1 but you will love it once you start using it.The above said, everything else about this Laptop is highly commendable. The price is reasonable, and Dell takes warranties and services very seriously. So far I had to use it only on the laptop that I acquired 13 years ago where they promptly gave me a battery and then a CD drive replacement. I have never had to contact them for any other machine.I recommend this Laptop with the above caveats!

$review_text.: After reading the reviews and seeing ThinkGeek carry these headphones, I decided to buy them on a whim. I already have 1 set of Monster Headphones and 2 Razer gaming headphones. I have also sampled many headphones throughout the years. I wont claim to be an expert on the technology involved in what makes a great audio experience, however I can tell what sounds good and what doesnt.That said, the Rosewill's do not have great sound. I repeat they do not have great sound, even after proper adjustment. They still end up sounding muffled, with strong mids but bad lows. Compared to my Razer set, they seem lacking. I sampled the Razer Kraken, Electra and Carcharius, all sound superior to the Rosewill and are far far far more comfortable to wear. While they dont have "5.1 surround sound" or vibrate, the user experience for gaming (audio) was just better overall.However, the Rosewill experience isnt bad necessarily. There is certainly something to be said for vibrating headphones. I think ultimately we are at a point where headphones with high comfort and sound quality will come along with the same kind of vibration and or haptic feedback, we just dont seem to have that yet...at least with the Rosewill.Another aspect of the Rosewill that is not so good is the fact that they are tight. Meaning they are squeezing your head and the pressure mixed with the weight dont make it a very comfortable set of headphones. You will most likely limit your usage to an hour at a time tops, otherwise it becomes very unpleasant.If you were to compare these to the general console focused headphones like the Turtlebeach lineup, then they will score pretty well. On the flip side, with brands like Razer and Logitech offering competitive pricing for better audio quality and comfort levels, it is hard to justify using the Rosewill's aside from the vibration function.Regarding the vibration, I like it. In fact I love it, and I think there is quite a bit of room for this kind of experience to be improved upon. However due to it being bundled with a not so comfortable headset and extremely generic sound quality, the potential of such audio/haptic feedback is dampened.For the price, its not bad, but better audio experiences can be had for around the same price range with the Razer brand. Surround Sound in headphones isnt all that amazing, or compatible to an actual surround sound speaker set up. With headphones, they shine when the quality is top notch. Thus, these are not enough to get me to stop using my Razer gaming headsets. I dont mention the Monster headphones in the comparison because quite frankly those are some of the best headphones money can buy and it wouldnt be fair. With a $300 price point and superior parts, it would make nearly all gaming headsets seem like crap. Then again, what defines a gaming headset? The microphone? The secret is, most non gaming headphones can be used for gaming and often result in better audio experiences.That said, to conclude this review... The Rosewill headphones are completely average in their sound quality. When you have experienced a wide range of headphones, from premium to mid level headphones, they dont impress much on the audio front. Comfort is questionable as it could be subjective, but for me personally they squeeze the head too tightly and hang too low thus putting pressure on the to of the ear. The microphone quality is above average for a headset mic. Ultimately it is the vibration and price point that sell these headphones. For a better audio experience, you can buy better headphones without spending much more. However if you are on a budget and want to experience something different, these will not be a horrible purchase. In otherwords, these are not a bad buy, but there is better. Its up to the user to decide whether or not the vibration is worth it at the cost of comfort and sound quality.

$REVIEW.: Having feared Sigma's QC, I felt hesitant to purchase
This lens works perfectly and is the companion to my cz135mm

lens


I've had to take in my Nikon 70-200mm VI, and 24-70mm zooms to the repair center, the first for back focus, and the later for the known abrasive sound from the zoom ring, and for front focus


Both now are superb


The Sigma has been through two shoots and performed as expected

The bokeh is creamy, the resolution and detail is quite astounding looking at a Sony A900 file
This is the first outside party lens I have purchased, and I may look at the upcoming 85mm f/1.4 lens by Sigma also if it proves to be as good as the 50mm.

$review_text.: Inherited an old Kindle DX which needed a new cover - this was a great deal and works as advertised - much like an Amazon OEM cover for smaller (keyboard) Kindles - but without the light. Unlike some other reviewers I have not had any problems with the device sliding around, or loose, BUT some of the corner pocket thingys are a little misaligned - looks a little wonky but does not affect unit (not enough to complain and try and get another one). I suppose if you tried to install/uninstall frequently you'd stretch the material and it would not hold properly - but I just installed it and left cover alone. The inner pocket is, in fact, sufficient for small items like boarding passes, etc. Haven't lost one yet. The reason I gave it 4 vs 5 stars is that although the product description claims it does not cover any controls, the upper right corner holder (i.e "thingy") partially covers the DX volume rocker (which I have never used anyway). Recommend.

$review_text.: The lenspen has been around for a while - it's rebranded like nobodies business:LensPEN Lens Cleaning System,Nikon 7072 Lens Pen Cleaning System,Lenspen LENMPII1 Minipro II Lens Cleaner For Digital Cameras, Camcorders, Scopes and Eyepieces (color may vary),Sima Lens Pen,Barska Lens Pento name a few.And the thing is, these have all been the SAME product with a new color and label printed on it.


which isn't necessarily a bad thing, since IT WORKS

But the Amazon one is a little different (reasons below).First, about the lenspen - it's similar in size to a "paint marker" or a beefy Sharpie


It's even got a clip to go onto your pocket
It's got 2 ends - one is the brush-end which retracts into the pen by default (see the yellow switch on the photo? slide it up to make the brush come out.

slide back down to hide it when not in use).The other end is a circular disc - this side has a cap on it to keep it clean.

the cap also has some "magic" in it that keeps the disc ready to clean


To use, put the cap on, give the pen a twist or two and then un-cap it

Wipe the lens with the disc to clear off any smudges, fingerprints, dust, etc.


then re-cap it until needed again.So why is this so great? Well..* It's compact (fits in a bag, your pocket, anywhere).* It's got 2 tools (brush and cleaning piece)* It's cheap! 5-10 bucks* It's been "tried and tested" for years, recommended by almost all that try it.I tried the lens papers before and was always terrified the paper would scratch my lenses


I tried the microfibers, but they often made things worse (if you got a fingerprint on the lens, the cloth would often just smudge it around and not really get rid of it)


I've heard horror stories with the liquids

The air-blowers (Giottos AA1900 Rocket Air Blaster Large (Black)) are great, but hardly something you want to carry around all day because of the size.So whats the difference between the LENSPEN and the AMAZON LENSPEN?The LENSPEN is a bit longer and thicker than the AMAZON version

The original LENSPEN also has a slightly wider "disc" end (helpful for bigger lenses)
The AMAZON LENSPEN uses a smaller disc which can work better for smaller/compact camera lenses that the original LENSPEN might be too big for
More importantly, the AMAZON LENSPEN's disc flips around to have a triangle-tip.


this lets you get into small areas like the cameras viewfinder to clean that out.


for that alone, I bought 2 of these
The downside is that since the tip-piece is reversible (opposed to the original LENSPEN which uses a built-in tip) is that the tip sometimes comes off with the cap.See what's important to you - a bigger "disc" area or one that can be used for smaller lenses and viewfinders and choose either a regular lenspen or amazon one from there.These are usually rated to last a year or regular use, but I end up getting a couple a year to keep them "fresh", clean and in all my bags.

$review_text.: I had previously purchased the eForCity version of this adapter for my Galaxy Nexus which works great on the Nexus 7 also. However, reading through a forum (I read so many I don't remember which), it was suggested that this particular cable left no gap (look at  customer pics here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005QX7KYU/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00 for the device I purchased months ago) between the device and the cable (plug being the same length as the micro usb charger plug) which I thought would be better for the Nexus 7. In fact, the product picture shows a shorter plug. I just received this (18 days after order from Hong Kong which is not bad), and it appears to be exactly the same as the one I ordered earlier. On this one, there is some "give" when plugged into either device as compared to my other one which is still very snug when plugged into either device. If it fit perfectly, that "give" would not be a concern. I'm using the Kingston Digital Data Traveler SE9 which is fairly light and small; however, smaller flash drives can be found which might not put too much drag on the adapter and its loose connection. On the other hand, the regular USB female plug is very tight. It works fine.  Just wanted to mention that if you think you will get one with the correct size tip, you may, but you may not.  I'll keep it as a back-up. For the $$, it's really not worth an exchange or return as it does work.

$review_text.: I've been using this product casually for the past few weeks, and I've come to learn the ins and outs of the Intro.Comfort - The on-ear headphones are comfortable for short-term use, but after about an hour or so, they begin to hurt my ears. The backside presses down on the cartilage and provides a pain that becomes worse over time. Repositioning the headphones helps, but after a while, you just have to take them off.Sound - These headphones sound great for $25. I've been testing various in-ear, over-ear, and on-ear headphones for a few years now, and these live up to the sound of more expensive headphones in the $50 range. The bass is a little too powerful for my taste, though. Repositioning the headphones on your ears goes a long way in changing the sound of the headphones. When I wear them in a position that offers the best sound quality, they become very uncomfortable very fast.Build Quality and Design - Honestly, the build quality of these headphones is great. Sure, I can tell that some cheap plastics were used in making the product, but the design works well and gives the headphones a much more sophisticated look than one might expect for $25. The plastics used are engineered to feel soft at the touch. The cable comes out of the right cup (which is odd; most have cables that come from the left cups). It is located in a great place, where I am able to move the cable to hang down my backside instead of across my chest. Also, the microphone is a great addition. The collapsible cups are great, and the headphones feel sturdy and not prone to breaking, like other headphones at the same price.Overall - Great headphones for the price. I just wish they were more comfortable. But discomfort while using headphones goes a long way in limiting the amount of time that I am willing to use them. If they were more comfortable to wear, I would definitely have given the product 5 stars.

$REVIEW.: When receiving the package I was very disappointed that some functions were not working out of the box.  Instead of returning the merchandise to Amazon, I decided to go the manufacture warranty route.  So I called Acer the same day I received the package.  They had me go to Fedex.  Acer paid for shipping, but I did have to pay Fedex to package the laptop which is $20.  I specified the functions/features that were not working (Mostly the touchpad/volume control).  Bios installed was terrible (Couldn't even set boot sequence.)  10 days later I received my laptop back.  They did update my software/apps on the laptop, but I decided to reinstall the OS myself and do all the updating as well.  Looks like they updated the bios and now I have full control and can customize it.  They replaced the entire touchpad module.  Now the dual feature touchpad and volume control seems to be working correctly.  I was installing 4 to 5 different items simultaneously, while downloading, playing  music, surfing.  This new i7 did not even stress a little.  I need to find a benchmark app to really test it I guess.  You can do so many things at once especially with 8Gigs of ram.  As you can tell I am a happy customer.Pros - All the specs (Except hard drive.) Great Acer customer service.  In the past, I've read they were not that good.  However, I spoke to 3 different representatives and they were all very helpful and efficient.  I kept calling to make sure they took note on what were the discrepancies and also status on the repair and of course the 1st call was the initial warranty process thing.Cons - Hard drive.  This is the bottleneck.  However, after I upgrade it with a solid state drive (Once they're on sale..)  The value of this laptop should increase..=)  With the hardware in place, it will be a while I hope before I would need to upgrade this computer.  Also hoping that the hardware will last.I still own a Gateway and they are great laptops cause mine is still running flawlessly.  It is kind of ironic how Acer took over Gateway.  So in a way I bought a new Gateway just with the Acer name now.
$SUMMARY.: Acer has done me good!

$REVIEW.: I've had this product for a few weeks now and I have had a number of occasions to use it since I travel by air frequently.  My need was to recharge my iPhone primarily, but also several other USB powered devices from time to time.  APC should be commended for a lightweight, elegant battery solution that looks great and works just as well.Here's how the APC UPB10 stacked up:PROS:- Very nice look and feel, looks very executive- Solid overall construction and nice metal buttons- Fashionable, 2.5 inch graduated charging LED- Charges from a USB source itself, including a laptop, so no extra charger to be carried- Has both mini USB and full size USB connector- Surprisingly lightweight given the charge capacity (10W I believe)- Can fast charge an iPhone as good as a wall connectionCONS:- Charges only when main metal "on" button is pushed, not just by jacking in the plug, a very minor complaint- Only charges 20 minutes at a time, then needs another goose of the button, though this makes sure you don't waste power but requires occasional attention- Very slow recharging, can take hours, though this probably will make the battery live a lot longerBottom line, I would buy this product again in a heartbeat.

But apparently, the distance between between the phone (which is in my pocket; thin sweatpants) to this set of headphones is too much. What, two feet? The sound consistently cuts in and out.Putting the phone in the front pocket of a hooded sweatshirt isn't much better. And if I sit down... well, hardly any sound makes it through at all.I guess I could put the phone in an armband or duct tape it around my head. But that defeats the purpose of the so-called freedom of Bluetooth.Note that both the phone and the headphones were fully charged.So, if you're using an iPhone 5 with iOS 7, I can't recommend these. They're going back.Just to add, the fit in the ear is awesome. Also, the packaging is one of those nightmare deals.

$REVIEW.: I purchased the "Kingston Hyper X Blu 8 GB 1600MHz DDR3 Non-ECC CL9 XMP" version of this product
 It really is DDR3 1600MHz RAM, though you may see slightly slower CL-11 CAS Latency timing instead of the CL9 CAS Latency timing that Kingston is advertising if your motherboard doesn't support RAM over-clocking.After some BIOS tweaks to get the faster timing working on my motherboard, this RAM is working really well for me (better than the advertised CL9 XMP performance), and I think it's a good value for the money I paid (just under 70 dollars for 2x4 Gig Modules - 8 Gigs of total memory)If you are just looking for the short version, that's it - but if you'd like a little more tech info about this specific RAM, here it is 




.All modern memory modules have a small chip called a Serial Presence Detect ROM (SPD ROM) which has data programmed into it describing how the motherboard should clock that particular RAM, and according to the standard SPD data profile on this particular RAM, it should run at DDR3 1600 speed with CAS Latency timing equivalent to CL-11


 In order for you to automatically get the slightly faster CL9 speed, your motherboard must be able to detect and read a second special 'XMP' profile that is programed into the SPD ROM and automatically over-volt the memory by about 10 percent from 1.5 to 1.65 volts (which Kingston apparently feels is needed to juice it up enough to work at the slightly faster CL9 CAS Latency setting).Many motherboards still can't handle this XMP RAM overclocking automatically, requiring you to change settings to get it to work, or even worse, requiring that you understand a lot of geeky custom BIOS settings so you can manually set the RAM timing settings required

Otherwise there is basically no way to get the full advertised  performance out of your Kingston 'HyperX' RAM.I don't like the fact that Kingston over-hypes their HyperX RAM by advertising the 'overclocked' specifications rather than the guaranteed performance values programmed into the modules SPD ROM, because this means that if you don't have a motherboard that supports 'XMP' or RAM overclocking, you could be paying for performance you will never see.Fortunately, in this case at least, the difference between the main SPD data CL-11 profile and the XMP CL-9 profile is very small, so it's not really that big a deal
So, if you don't have XMP RAM overclocking on your motherboard, this memory should still run at DDR3 1600MHz CL-11, and when it comes to overall performance, this is only a hairs breadth from what you would see with a motherboard supporting DDR 1600MHz CL-9 XMP overclocking.Kingston does add some other extra value to their HyperX RAM modules by adding a very snazzy looking heat spreader and by testing to tighter timing tolerances in order to help them stand up to the added stress caused by overclocking - both of which could also improve reliability for those who never overclock their RAM.For me at least, that extra reliability is more important than squeezing out the last 2% of over-clocking speed - because I have had the really bad experience of having some non-Kingston no-name RAM gradually fail after several months - and when this happens, believe me, it's a nightmare, because the symptoms are all over the place - failures to boot - corrupted files on your hard drive - mystery crashes

I was ready to trash the whole PC, when I decide to try swapping around the RAM with some spare RAM I had on hand, and found the problem was a flaky RAM module
 The Kingston RAM I replaced that no-name failed RAM module with is still going strong after 4 years, and that's counts for something with me.Having said that, my loyalty to Kingston does not extend to throwing money away, so I try to avoid the more 'Hype'd' HyperX versions, and stay with the basic 'blu' version.This RAM did plug in and work reliably right off the bat, but sad to say, 'XMP' did NOT work for me 'out of the box' because, my brand new Gigabyte C1037UN motherboard did NOT detect the 'XMP' profile and preset the faster RAM timing.My motherboard, did allow me to manually configure the RAM timing though, and in the end this worked out better anyway, because, surprisingly, I found I was able to reduce the combined latency numbers down to a fast 8-8-8-24 setting, while still holding the RAM voltage at the lower standard, safe, 1.5 volts (instead of the higher plus 10% 1.65 volt XMP overvolt setting).So, I'm getting even better than the advertised XMP CL9 performance, without overvolting my RAM at all
 I actually prefer this, because I don't like the idea of overvolting RAM beyond the +/- 5% range recommended by most RAM chip manufactures.If you don't understand what numbers like CL-11 CL-9 or 8-8-8-24 mean, these numbers refer to 'CAS Latency' (CL) and other 'latency' or recovery-time values, which are a measure of how much idle time, measured in clock cycles, is needed between specific parts of the RAM's read/write cycle

 Lower latency (smaller numbers) mean less wasted time, therefor faster RAM transfer rates.Having the HyperX profile make the difference between a CL-11 vs

CL-9 may sound like a big deal (~20% or so) but CAS Latency is only one of many factors, and it's contribution to a difference in overall performance is MUCH lower
In fact, even dropping all the way from CL-11 to CL-8, the difference is pretty small


 To even see the change clearly, I had to run a benchmark program specifically designed to measure RAM performance, and then the difference is a modest but noticable 8 percent improvement in RAM transfer speed *BUT* note that this does NOT translate into an 8 percent better OVERALL CPU performance factor.In my tests, the overall system benchmarks for things like video playback, or 3D Game rendering, only improved about 1 percent (and in some cases even less!).So, even after tweaking the RAM timing manually in my BIOS all the way from the default 11,11,11,27 CAS Latency all the way down to 8,8,8,24, the difference is almost unnoticeable in terms of actual performance.With the way manufactures like Kingston hype their higher end 'Hyper' RAM products, you might find it hard to believe that the difference is so small, but you can easily double check my results by comparing them with RAM testing benchmarks on the web

 If you are looking at benchmarks that are ONLY related to RAM speed and CAS latency numbers, and no other overclocking factors, you will find that in pretty much every case, regardless of the application, Gaming, Streaming Video, or just surfing the Web, using higher speed so called 'Performance RAM' just doesn't make all that much of a difference by itself


 To get a really big effect from overclocking, you have to overclock the full system by increasing the CPU multiplier or frontside bus frequency, and faster RAM clocking may be a small part of this process, but just buying faster RAM by itself does very little.UPDATE:The difference in overall performance was so small, that I have decide to back my manual RAM timing values off to slightly slower settings of 9-9-9-26 (even though the theoretically faster 8-8-8-24 numbers are rock-solid stable with my motherboard)
 I did this because there just isn't that much difference performance wise, and as I said above, reliability is the most important factor for me, and the 9-9-9-26 numbers should give me a nice solid safety margin to insure long term reliability while still working very nicely at 1.5 volts (I still am not using the XMP 1.65 volt RAM overvolt setting).If all this information seems a little too much to have to worry about - then don't - because, truthfully, it just doesn't make all that big of difference one way or the other.The bottom line is - if you need DDR3 1600 memory - this is good quality stable RAM that should just 'plug right in' and get the job done for you without costing you an arm and a leg in the process - I highly recommend it.

Weird shape; almost zero padding. Pain at top of ears & side of head.Back of headset sticks out over an inch behind the back of my neck. Cannot rest my head against the headrest any more! Pain in the neck.If I do let my head rest against the chair's headrest (which is what it's for!), then the back of the band pushes the earphones an inch forward of my ears. Then it hurts worse than ever and pinches even tighter.I have pieces of old socks wrapped around the band near the ears to try & reduce some of the pinching pain. Doesn't really work - there isn't enough room between band & earphones to make installing padding practical.If Logitech would make these in several sizes (how about Small, Medium or Large?) it might be better for more people. This unit might make people with giant heads happy, but my normal head is having an awful time with this unit. Neck and shoulders are not enjoying this either.

$REVIEW.: I read mostly good reviews for this Pistol Grip, so I ordered it. The first thing you notice is how heavy it is! Adding to the weight, the cumbersome, large size makes it inconvenient, awkward to carry around. I carry it in a large photo vest pocket, until I am ready to set up my tripod. If you use it with the grip away from the camera, it often gets in your face-literally. If you are shooting a tall building, the grip has to be turned to your right 90 degrees, otherwise the ball head will not tilt up.I liked the fact that the quick release is round and convenient to install on the camera and on a tripod; I also liked how solid the grip feels when, after the camera is set up, all the controls are rock solid.This grip would be perfect for a studio set up, or when working at a fixed location a long time.

On top of that, my eye still sits too far from the viewfinder screen to see it all at once. Sometimes this means that I miss important information like a shutter speed set too slow to avoid blurring or the fact that my flash unit isn't quit ready yet for the next shot. Or I miss seeing a portion of the scene that I would have liked to completely include or exclude from the shot. The Canon EP-EX15 Eyepiece Extender solves this by showing me the entire viewfinder screen all at once. And I no longer have to keep adjusting my viewing angle or smashing my nose to do it.

$REVIEW.: I recently purchased a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and a Logitech 810 keyboard. I have a cover for the Kindle and the keyboard was an afterthought. I realized since I purchased a keyboard that didn't bundle itself with a Kindle case (after reading reviews, I decided against that) I still needed something that would hold both things together.This case was very inexpensive. The neoprene stretches so there was no problem putting the keyboard and Kindle in its case in the bag. The handles are soft and stretchy, I can put them over my wrist if I'm carrying a lot of things and it's no bother at all. Along with the Kindle/case and keyboard, I use the outside pocket. In THAT, I fit the Kindle rapid charger, the keyboard charger, screen cleaner and cloth, and my earphones.Even if I didn't have the keyboard, I can see the value in having one central place to put everything and I can also see the value in having it not be related to the Kindle cover itself.  While the price wasn't 100% what swayed me toward this bag, I really can't see how you can go wrong with it especially because it is less expensive than anything else out there.

$REVIEW.: The mic came in the original xbox plastic packaging which was stuffed into a bubble lined yellow envelope. It was punctured because of the other end of the mic.There was a lot of static coming from my end of the mic, according to my friends, and my voice was not audible. The one positive, I could hear everyone fine.... You get what you pay for.
$SUMMARY.: Came poorly packed and didn't work very well

$review_text.: Bought mine yesterday when my Ink'd failed once again, but this time, not sonically. I'm keeping my Smokin/Rasta for one reason, they don't have the metal screen used in the Ink'd buds, and I primarily use buds for listening to books. Put my cans on for music. Anyway, the danger point for using the Ink'd is the fact my 3rd pair's metal screen fell out of the bud! I wouldn't want this falling in my ear canal! Dangerous? I have no idea, but I'm not taking the chance, and the Smokin buds don't use a mesh screen that I can see, and sound decent enough for $20. Ink'd buds sound better to me, louder to me, and all around better deal, but that screen has me bothered now, dang! Thought I had found the perfect performance/price ratio for a product that is constantly being replaced as these inexpensive buds only last 2-4 months, for me anyway. I sleep with them on listening to books, have a youngin that gets hold of them now & again, and the general build of inexpensive buds lends to erly failure for most of us. Can't imagine spending $300 or more on some Sure's if the quality is simular. The plugs fail constantly, but give credit where credit is due, SkullCandy stands behind their gear with  liftime warranty so you can't go wrong, and I will be letting them know about that metal screen/mesh cover falling out, could be a hazzard if it fell into your ear canal, I don't want to be the one to find out! lolP.S. I have Microsoft Zune V2 in ear buds, Actual Apple IPOD earphones, Ink'd, and a few others. All of them $30, and under. The plugs fail everytime, and $30 is a bit much to keep replacing so I found screw on, gold plated plugs at Radio Shack for around $3.50 EA They work great, but very difficult to hook up as the lines used on these buds are not only hair thin, but angel hair thin! REAL, REAL, Thin! Very hard to twist up, and wrap around the screw posts. I have to use a magnifying glass. However, the more you install, the easier it gets, and your buds have new life. These plugs are also heavy compared with stock plugs, but this does not deter from use in most instances. BTW, of all the less expensive buds, I like the Zune Premium V2 best, but they are now selling for over $60, but did see some for $43 on the net, just search. They are worth $43 to me, but not more than that. They retailed for $29.99, but I assume they are not made anymore. The Ink'd, at $10, are a steal! However, that screen HMM???

$review_text.: Not only did it arrive super fast (it was either two or three days), but this battery is great! I have a hand-me-down Dell Inspiron 3800 laptop that I was using this on, so I never really knew what kind of battery life it could have with a new battery. It turns out to be more than three hours with the hard drive really cranking (due to some system problems I am working on). I can't wait to see how much longer it will be when I streamline the system. The old battery was completely shot and wouldn't last more than five minutes so I am very happy with this battery.

$REVIEW.: I would have to guess I have installed at least 25 of these over the past several years to replace onboard NIC's that have gone bad.  I have yet had to have one fail.  Install is easy and straight forward (Shut the PC down, install/swap NIC, turn on computer, insert CD and let Windows do the rest).  I can replace the old card and have the user back online in around 5 minutes.  You can't go wrong with this as a basic network card.

$REVIEW.: Just got these today. They sound pretty good! I love the features and the included accessories (like the aux cable and the mp3/phone cradle). The highs are very vibrant. The lows are okay...not too pronounced but what do you expect from this size speakers. I would have liked more presence from the mids out of the gate. Yes, you can adjust your EQ settings on your computer or tv, etc. But, the mids are lacking just a bit. That's not to say that you can't get them how you want them. Finally, the subwoofer is decent and the bass knocks quite well. More than what I expected.If I have any gripes (hence the 4/5 stars), it would be that the speakers do not have a metal mesh covering over them. A kid or your pet, etc can easy damage the cones if they come in contact with them. Also, the bass setting on the volume module has the typical old-school wheel adjustment. There are no tick marks or notches so you can kind of get an idea of how much subwoofer bass you are applying. Other than that, I like these speakers. For this price range (under $40), definitely worth it!

$REVIEW.: BACKGROUNDEvery touch screen device that I use has a screen protector

 Without it, over time, the functionality or sensitivity of the touch screen wanes.INSTALLATIONInstallation is quite easy, and so was removing the tiny bubbles

 At least a solution doesn't have to get into the mix - like the Zagg screen shields.USEThese shields provide a nice anti-glare interface


 Sensitivity of the touch screen is by no means diminished

 I have been using this since I received it and there is no durability issue


 It doesn't easily peel off, like other screen savers used.OVERALLThis is a good set of screen protectors

 It will likely outlast my Kindle Fire with just one sheet.I highly recommend them.

$review_text.: I got the teleprompter and put it together with no problems in about 10 minutes. I mounted the camera on it and went to mount the whole assembly on the tripod when I encountered my first problem: Because of the small bolt heads sticking out from the bottom of the plate, I wasn't able to slide the entire assembly onto the tripod. I could only push it about 1/2 of the way on before the bolt heads hit the side of the tripod head and stopped (although the plate was secure- it still would slide). I had to use gaffer's tape to secure the plate to the tripod. It was secure the whole time and the mirror assembly worked as advertised. This may be unique to my situation.Now a tip, not a criticism: The mirror will also reflect the floor under the iPad and if it's a light color, it can prove to be a distraction. I put a black case under the mirror to solve this, but I can see getting a yard or so of black fabric to address this in the future.

$review_text.: $5, great product by a great brand and does a great job.Its poorly built though. Thing  split into 3 pieces as I tried removing the unit. connecting wires to the board are as thin and breakable as they get and just glued on. Worried I may have broke it before I could try it when the circuit board was exposed. It cost $5 and should expect $5 worth of quality. You'd spend just as much if not more on similar products.Plug Logitech Unifying reciever, bluetooth adapater and a wifi adapter and you have all your wireless needs taken care without taking space and leaving open another port. All I have are nano recievers and flash drives so I get tons of multi-function wireless support through one USB slot.Noticed the bottom on the unit does get warm and its only been 30 minutes... wonder if its too dangerous to plug-in and forget like I do with my other USB devices.

$review_text.: The biggest point worth mentioning before all else: this power bank will charge androids and iPhone 5's. Got an iPhone 4? It's not going to work without an adapter. I'm a big fan of built in tuck-away-able ports and cords, but I find this a little too limiting since I don't upgrade my iPod to the latest model every year.The carabiner is nice but I find that I never end up using it - this device is too valuable for me to want to normally clip to my backpack, to be stolen or otherwise damaged while hiking.It gets really hot for a seemingly small amount of juice-giving. This is far from the fastest (or most powerful) power bank I've used, so I'm not sure why it gets so hot when other devices have not... maybe because of the small size? And yet if you're looking for portability I'm positive there are other, better power banks out there.My opinion: pass on this one. Get a larger, more powerful power bank (this one is my current favorite) or try a different model if looking for a small portable device.

$REVIEW.: This is the second NAXA boombox I have purchased for my son in the past 45 days

 The first one worked fine for about 3 days and then the MP3-CD and SD functions konked out

 I returned that to Amazon, no problem.So I bought this model, thinking that it was just a fluke the first time and perhaps if I spent a little more money this one would work out


 I sent it to my son at camp and guess what?  Same problem, except this time it worked for about 1.5 days and then the MP3-CD and SD functions stopped working.Except now, since I am 2 days past the Amazon return time period, I can't get the same return even though there was almost no way I could get it back to Amazon in the time-frame allotted.Oh well, I guess I will take my lumps and learn a lesson about this one
 I just won't trust NAXA products again

 They look cool (which my son liked quite a bit) but they turned out to be worthless as far as I am concerned.

$REVIEW.: I have yet to drop my Ipad with this case on it, and I don't plan on it, but I think it will hold up if I drop it. It looks and feels just like all the other otter box cases. It does make the Ipad a little heaver, but I don't mind for the extra protection. I like the plastic screen cover. It does have glare on it every once in a while, but again, I would rather have the extra protection on it. The toggle switch is a little hard to switch until you get the hang of it, but I don't use it that much anyways. I do not find the other buttons hard to press.

$review_text.: I've had a couple of Maha chargers, all AA/AAA models, and when my Maha finally had part of the board fail, the part which holds the AC adapter's input, I knew it was time to look around and see what'd changed in the last several years.  I was quite early to the NiMH party, after eventually giving up on NiCads because of their, um, 'issues'.This La Crosse makes me **very** happy.  It has a ton of information, and the conditioning aspect appears to have recovered two cells I thought were destined for the recycle bin at Lowe's.It's quick, and I like how it will charge just one cell.  It's not often I have just one requiring a charge, but I do have some devices which have three.I understand there were problems for a while with this model, but I've been working my new one pretty much non-stop for a few days, and it's still fine.So...when do we get lithium ion AA/AAA's?edit:  There is a bug in this charger in that, if the NiMH cells are discharged enough, the charger will not 'see' them.  Quick hack for this is to unplug the charger, put the dead cell(s) in the bays, leaving one open.  In the open bay, put either a fully-charged cell or an alkaline with a decent amount of life left.  Now jump the top terminal between the 'live' one and the dead one(s).  A bent paperclip is fine.  Do this for about 60 seconds per cell, remove the alkaline battery (if you put one in there), plug the unit in, and you should see all the previously unseen batteries taking a charge.  If they don't, repeat the above procedure, but leave the paperclip jumper in for a couple of minutes.

$review_text.: Awesome upgrade!  Now that SSD prices have dropped from the stratosphere for disks large enough to be useful, it's well worth the price.The only reason I would NOT recommend this drive is that both OCZ and others have now come out with SATA-III drives in the same price range that can handle 6GB/s, which comes out to around 600 MEGABYTES per second transfer rate
However, I had to replace my motherboard a few months ago (had been planning to hold out a bit longer but couldn't) and I don't like spending the huge extra amounts to get the "latest" tech and the motherboard I bought only has SATA-II
 This was about $20 less than SATA-III SSD's at the time.Even with just the SATA-II, this has MASSIVELY improved overall speed
Once the Win7 logo has "formed" boot-up is FIVE SECONDS

 ELEVEN seconds for full shutdown
 Previously a reboot could take up to five MINUTES, and that's with the drives regularly defragged, 3GHz dual-core processor and 4GB RAM
Most programs now load in about 3 seconds and before they could take a minute, sometimes longer
(UPDATE: I just did a read benchmark test under Linux: 93 MegaBYTES/s is the SLOWEST read rate! AVERAGE was 193MB/s and max was 229MB/s
 I couldn't test write speed but I can tell that it has increased by about the same as the read speed.)My system is set up with this as Drive C: and most of my data on a 1.5TB drive


 I did not do a new install (actually, I was already in the process of doing a new Win7 install, which takes me over 100 hours with all the application software and related updates) and from what I can tell the drive is using Microsoft's standard SATA drivers, not some special SSD drivers
 I did find an SSD Tweaker utility.

Since I had never heard of Komputerbay before, I was leery about ordering this, but my fears were aswayed when I installed the 2Gb of RAM and was pleasantly surprise my operating system recognized the module and I now had 8Gb! I noticed a speed difference right off the bat

$REVIEW.: I have avoided web cams for quite some time and when I needed one, I originally bought a really cheap one here.  It was like $6 and it claimed to do 5MP pics and basically you get what you pay for because it didn't do very good quality at all.  Now with this Logitech the same rule applies....You get what you pay for.  Very clean pics, very clean movies with smooth motion and I'm very happy with this purchase.  There is a blue LED in the front when the software is running and I'm very curious ...Actually I have to know one way or another if the light comes on whenever it's "active"  I am concerned that if somebody were to hack my computer, they would have access to crystal clear video and audio of potentially damaging personal stuff. I'm in School now taking a Network Security class and it doesn't take a skilled person to simply download and use a hackers program...Script Kiddies.  The fact is, the video and audio are so clear that it would be devastating if you were talking to your bank and somebody was watching you.  Until I know for sure, I will simply unplug it when not in use, but eventually I have to know what that light truly represents, and if it's safe to leave plugged in when not in use.  I'll be back to update later.  ***I've already had a chance to use VLC with this camera and from what it looks like so far, the LED stays off until I actually start a stream.  VLC has hundreds of options for recording, so it makes a fun test area.  Still learning...

This product was small, highly rated, and inexpensive.  I run my laptop and my xbox off of this switch, with no problems or noticeable impact in performance.My only issue is sometimes the internet just wont connect, and a quick reset (unplug and plug back in) will bring the connection back.  I'd prefer not to have this problem, but its infrequent, and could be my schools internet to begin with.  Its crowded and not always reliable on its own.

$REVIEW.: This drive -- which is available ridiculously inexpensively if you shop around -- does exactly what it sets out to do. It burns DVD+R/RW discs, and CD-R/RW discs, and does so quite reliably.The drive installs easily and will be recognized by Windows XP without any further need for configuration.The included software will be sufficient for creating DVDs of your own videos (from your digital camcorder, say, or captured from videotapes if you have a capture card), and burning them, as well as creating and burning MP3, audio, and JPG CDs. None of the included applications are industry leaders, but they're competent.If you want to copy commercial DVDs you can, using tools you can find easily, but I won't go into that here.I've successfully burned TDK and Ritek DVD+R blanks at 4x, and some generic blanks at 2.4x, and no coasters yet. I've also successfully written, played, erased and reqritten Imation DVD+RW blanks.Just keep in mind this is a &quot;plus&quot; drive. While DVD+ is compatible with most DVD players, it's not compatible with equipment that is DVD &quot;minus&quot; only, such as many Apple computers.A 5-star drive would write both &quot;plus&quot; and &quot;dash,&quot; and would come with better software. But as of this writing, it would also cost considerably more.

$REVIEW.: After a preparing the wall, and making holes and finally mounting the TV... Disappointment. Some reviews pointed the same issue with the slacking of the arm with the weight of the tv is a fact. I went by all the positive reviews but cheap is what we pay and crap is what you get I guess is the situation. The mount itself is sturdy but the weight of the TV, which I purchsed is M320NV weighs about 20lbs will cause it to lean fwd. After all the hardwork to put it up, was pretty disappointing. I suggest go with another product. After all said and done it isnt worth taking it back off to put a new mount, plus the holes you will need to patch up.... Suggest go with a little more reliable mount then this one.

Bought them, and can definitely tell the difference between these and my old $10 koss headphones. Also bought a sound card for my computer and started recording music in FLAC. (free lossless audio codec/supposedly much better than mp3) I can't really tell FLAC>mp3, but can easily tell between these and any other headphones I've had on.Good fit. If they're too tight, you can have them stretched out on a chair arm or something. I didn't have to do this and have a good sized head and wear glasses.

$review_text.: This TV is all the Amazon (and Cnet) reviews) claimed it to be. I live on top of a hill and the set received 15 different numbers channels using amplified rabbit ears. SD broadcasts are much better thru the 4661 Samsung set than thru the CRT set, and CBS, ABC, and Fox broadcast more than one signal. The best part of the whole new TV thing was that the Samsung talked to itself after I first turned it on and it found and stored all 15 channels. The built in menu is great! as I was able to intuitively discover how to switch from TV to DVD jusy by pushing buttons on the remote.There are more HD broadcasts available than I suspected. The local stores were still selling off the older inventory, and the 4661 really perfoms better than the reviews of the earlier version of the 46" Samsung. There are no issues of the "clouding" reported by so many for the Sony sets. Of the 15 channels only one has a conflict when aiming the antenna. The Wineguard MS 2000 omnidrection antenna (hard to find on Internet) may solve that problem

$review_text.: I am a spec-oriented person
I was drawn to this model on what I consider to be a rational evaluation of the specs
The screen specs and 3rd generation i7 at my 11 bones cost had me pull the trigger six weeks ago.First of all here and on BB there are suggestions for user upgrades

I seriously suggest you wait until using the machine for six months


Three weeks in mine suffered some serious failures ending in a catastrophic failure of the display panel which would have left me holding a thousand buck brick if I had done any upgrading

Asus support is bad enough

If I had opened the case I'd have been right in the center of Dante's inferno instead of simply one or two rings in


Don't upgrade until five or six months of burn in -- there is a good chance you will need your warranty.That brings the first thing you will notice after a few days of ownership: even though the specs look good, performance is significantly sub par
That is precisely why there are so many discussions about upgrading

It has an i7 but performs like an i5


It has a screen on paper that looks good but the panels must have been bought off the back of the truck.Yes, 1080 IPS

Sounds great right? Wrong
You are better off with 768 given the light bleed and failure rate which I learned later on this


I am not finickly about a little light bleed but I promise you have never seen as much light bleed as this
I have hundred buck box 36" store TV's with less light bleed.Even minor things are glaring and show bad engineering choices


I wanted an back-lit keyboard
The backlighting on this keyboard is so bright at minimum setting, that if you are using it in dark situations where you need it you will be lighting up the room and making the screen experience terrible.What is up with the track-pad? Was that bought by the same corporate buyer who got the garbage display panels? I can image dozen a pallets of  these being bought in some back ally! "30% off" because 30% of the pad a dead zone
Yes I have applied the Asus patches on the trackpad and along with other users see no improvement.The implementation of the hdd cache boggles
It literally does nothing

It is as if the machine was engineered and built, and someone raised their hand at a final meeting and said "we can't put on the ultra-book logo without a cache" to the dumfounded looks of the rest of team
That must have been a meeting that looked like NASA trying to figure out how to scrub the CO2 from Apollo 13 -- "how much duct tape is on board?"  Solution? Solder some flash onto the MB, call it a hybrid, and shrug at the fact that it decreases performance from a standard HDD! They may as well scotch tape 24g of flash unconnected to the outside of the case and call it hybrid.Processor: my precious i7, performs as implemented like an i5Backlight keyboard: Sounds good, implementation worse than no backlightBattery life: Average on paper, real life worst in its classDisplay Panel: great on paper, poor in realityCasing: looks good until you touch it and see it is paper thinWifi: dual band reads nice on paper, implementation (antenna placement?) poorHDD: 500GB with cache good on paper, not good in realityTouchpad: What the heck Asus!?!?User upgradeable": You read about this so much precisely because it is a DOG out of the box relative to what the specs should deliver

I suspect like me people get it and say: "what is wrong here, let me bump it up." Ask yourself why are their youtubes on replacing wifi cards that are dual band out of the box? Why are people dropping four hundred bones on 500gb ssds when that shoudl only only be a minor real world improvement over a proper cache hybrid? Why are people downgrading to windows 7 (Answer: to try and get around the fact that win8 and proper drivers were an afterthought this model.)Sorry to be so negative on this unit

But I have never in my 20 years of ownership of dozens of laptops seen a better example of good on paper, terrible in reality -- especially at the premium slot.

$review_text.: There is something to Y Jiang's review below
I just received my player in the mail today and have been listening to it for the past 8 hours


Within the first 2 or 3 minutes of listening I heard this horrible crackling sound - very loud and audible


Since then, there have been sporadic (barely noticeable) crackles here and there

I think I can live with the unit as is

The price was right ($67 with free shipping)
I can get plenty of songs on this thing


Actually the last 2 hours (straight) I have been listening I have not heard a single crackling sound, so maybe it's getting better?I went running with this unit tonite


I placed it into my jacket pocket where it was bobbing up and down (I only zipped up my pocket with cord hanging out, I didn't really secure the unit)
It promptly froze up

I was only able to get the unit back working by taking the battery out and putting it back in.The supplied armband is wayy too stretchy and long
It falls down too easily and I am a fairly large 5'7" male, 176 lbs.Audio quality is good


It is not audiophile quality but then again, for $69 what do you expect? Sounds seem to be faithfully reproduced

Treble could be a bit more clear and stronger
Bass is good
Amplification through supplied headphones seems ok

You have to set it around 30 to get it fairly loud (out of 40).The supplied headphones are good
The sound is actually quite full and the range is decent.I'm listening to my Grado SR80's as I write this so I do have something good to compare them to


My qualm about the supplied earphones is that they are uncomfortable to wear and kind of large, even for my ears


I can't imagine how they would fit on a person with smaller ears.Some reviewers complained of lack of bass

Let me pose a question: Maybe your rip wasn't all that great to begin with


Also, perhaps your headphones aren't that great at producing bass
Maybe you had the EQ setting on "Classic" where the Bass is set at -3 at 14khz.Speaking of the EQ it is a 5 band from 50khz to 14khz plus or minus 12 decibels
There are presets with Pops, Classic, Rock, Jazz, Normal, and User selectable

So far my experience with the EQ has been very negative

Every time I try to use the darn thing not only does it start crackling but it actually starts to slow down (play speed decreases)
I turned that sucker back to normal and everything went back fine.One cute option: While in playback mode you have the option of viewing the peak level meter (right and left frequencies), amount of time left in the song, EQ, or volume bar


I have it set on amount of time left in the song.Other complaint: The player will occasionally stop playing


I'm not sure if it is doing this because it is at the end of the playlist inside the directory or what
It would be nice if it just kept playing into the next song on the next directory.User interface: I don't find it difficult to navigate menus on this unit (The joystick is kinda small however)
In fact, I actually found it be be fairly intuitive


I didn't even have to look at the manual to figure out how to move from one folder to another
One nice feature: you can configure it to right or left handed persons


This way the screen will actually flip horizontally so you can use the directional pad with either hand


One thing I do not like is the way songs are displayed on the menu
Yes the names of the songs do scroll across, but they do so at an agonizingly slow rate

If you are looking for a specific song and you are trying to run through the list quickly, you will have to select the song, and then sit there and wait until the name scrolls by
What I have done is eliminate the name of the artist altogether or trimmed it down to 2 or 3 characters

This way the song title is (entirely or partially) visible as soon as you view the menu.Setup was a snap

I downloaded the drivers from Sandisk website (I could have used the CD but I chose not to); Restarted my computer, hooked up the MP3 player through the USB port, created a directory under the new drive and threw some songs into it


I could have thrown all the MP3's into the root directory if I wanted to


The instruction manual (PDF) from Sandisk website tells you to install and use the MusicMatch Jukebox player to transfer files


You *don't* have to use this program to transfer files to your MP3 player!The FM radio reception is good


The auto scan feature is nice as it automatically places the strongest signals into the presets for you

Luckily the unit didn't find more than 20 stations (that is the max number of presets)

I was able to delete the stations that I don't listen to (like the Spanish ones).The voice recorder does a decent job


Sounds a bit muffled, but I can use it to record info for my upcoming Natl Board.This unit gets 4 stars overall but 5 for value
Ole! Good job Sandisk
Hopefully you will do better in your next series, there is room for improvement!2/13/05This is an update of the previous review above: I bought the 850mah Nimh rechargeables by Energizer and these are horrible

I got about 10 minutes of run time
Looks like I'll have to go with disposable batteries


An online search turned up no better than 1000 mah AAA Nimh's


I seriously doubt these will perform that much better than 800 Nimh


Just something to keep in mind
I wish Sandisk had gone with AA, that way I could use my 1700mah AA's and get good performance.Incidentally I have only had sporadic occurrences of the small clicks and pops that I had mentioned earlier

The supplied headphones are much too uncomfortable for me to wear, despite the fact that they look nice and sound good too
Plus they fall out easily when I run


I have purchased a set of Sony EX81's and will report on that if I get the chance.I really love this little player and take it wherever I go
:) The size is so small and cute


I went to Best Buy and looked at the other MP3 players


Wow! This MP3 player is definitely among the smallest players out there

I just wish there were better quality AAA rechargeable Nimh's available

It is hard for me to say how long the batteries last

I have been using the player an average of several hours per day for the past week
I just burned through the original supplied battery tonite after 5 days of use

If I had to guess, I would probably say I got about 12-15 hours out of it.By the way, the reviewer Jack Dantes "John G" is completely wrong about battery consumption
This mp3 player does not use any batteries when you transfer songs to and from the player


As a test, I took the batteries out and transferred some songs to the unit and it worked fine.

There is no room for the wrist strap, an extra battery, or even a slim memory card.  Also there is no belt clip, just a loop.  The padding protection is minimal.I plan to purchase a nice, small Lowepro Ridge 10 case that will accommodate the camera and the few accessories I need to carry with it.  Nikon could have done much better with this one.  I'd recommend against wasting one's money on it -- a much better case can be purchased in the same price range.

$review_text.: If you're here, you're probably trying to figure out whether you can live with 256 MB with all the "bigger fish" in the sea. What features you can live with, and what you can't. Maybe even how much a brand name like iPod is worth to you. But if you're like me, you have your eye out for value, too. With this in mind, I can heartily recommend this little player to a good number of (though not all) prospective listeners.Let's be clear here. SanDisk's 256 MB player in particular is designed for a specific niche of users. It's not for audiophiles, nor is it for people who want to take a ton of music with them all the time. You're probably a good match for this player if you need some portable music during a task - the gym, the library, a bike ride, a morning's commute - and don't intend to be jamming non-stop to fresh tunes the entire day.Here's what you'll get: a sleek little red player that scores solidly across the board. We have mainstream support for the old (MP3) and the new (WMA DRM), a suprisingly readable screen, a pretty good form factor and some little extras here and there. Yes, this comes at the expense of space. But you get everything that you'd expect on an MP3 player. And consider how much your money gets you here, compared to the competition. Without question, the going price of this 256 MB player is one of its key strengths - it's not a serious investment.With that said, if you're willing to invest more, there's a few issues to bear in mind with this player. The menus and controls, while quickly grasped with a bit of experimentation, may be confusing to users who don't intend to read the manual (which, unfortunately, is not very extensive). Sorry, you only get one color choice here. And the plastic sleeve that comes with it is functional, but feels like a cheap afterthought. But hey. That's what I'm trying to get at with this review. The player is functional AND cheap (in the good sense).Many people have been complaining about the radio. But I think it's fair to say that nobody's buying this player primarily to listen to the radio. It's just there for value. Think of it as a supplement to your space - if you were to play through all 256 MB of your stored music, the radio's there in case you need it. I'd say the same about the voice recorder - just in case.If you were thinking about the iPod Shuffle, as I was for a while, consider: this is still definitely pocket-sized; the screen is there to help you navigate; you don't need to install iTunes; you can change your own battery. On the flip side, you'll be carrying around less music, and you'll need to keep a USB cable handy at your computer.In the end, you just have to weigh your options. Know what you want, and find the best player for your needs. For the gym, this was the best choice, and I'm happy with it. SanDisk's little player is going to give you your music, when you need it, without cleaning out your wallet. Best of luck in your search.
$SUMMARY.: A mainstream player. Without the frills.

I couldn't find the USB sync adapter anywhere and found out from Creative that they no longer make that available, so this kit is perfect.

$REVIEW.: I feel pretty lucky compared to other people who reviewed this mouse
 I like it a lot except for one or two minor problems.This mouse feels much better in my hand than any other mouse I have tried so far
 And I like the feel of the wheel also.So far I have not had to replace the batteries but it has only been one week.My main complaint is that sometimes you spin the mouse wheel and the screen does not move

 I have two of these mice and the both do it, on two separate PCs
 So it is definitely a design issue with these mice.I find that to be very annoying
 But if you can get past that, it is a nice mouse.



$SUMMARY.: A nice mouse with one or two glitches

$REVIEW.: If I wasn't concerned about scratching up or damaging my beloved Canon S100, I'd just stick it in my front pants pocket
This nice Case Logic zip case is the next best thing

About as minimalistic and protective as you can get while still keeping my camera right at hand

Plus it has an extra zip compartment just the right size for a spare SD card and a fresh back up battery

Like all Case Logic products I've bought, it is well padded, well thought out, and extremely well made of toguh material-complete with handy zipper pull tabs you can easily get hold of.The case comes with a strong, well designed carabiner you can use to hook the case to a belt loop

If it is missing anything, I think I would have also liked a slim carry strap so I could sling it over my shoulder instead of hanging it where it bounces against my hip or -- if I put it where it is really easy to reach -- hangs down in front of my fly like an unwanted door knocker.


$SUMMARY.: Just about perfect for Canon S100

$REVIEW.: If you read my reviews you know I have cases...lots of them.  I have them for my iPad and my iPad mini.  At first I didn't think I would care for this case.  I thought it would be like any other boring, black case.  I feel it gives my mini the best protection out of all of the cases I own.  I feel safe using the auto off/on feature because the &#34;lock&#34; on it securely latches it closed:  something I haven't found yet (others don't latch...they're just magnetized and often cause my battery to die because they aren't fully closed).It comes apart but securely closes with a very strong magnet.  The magnet is what allows you to rotate it from landscape to portrait (or vice-verce).  I will admit I didn't do any security drops so I can't attest to that, however, I do feel very comfortable with my mini being in this case.Short. Sweet. To the point.  Thank you.

$REVIEW.: suction cup mounts work well for a brief period then they stop working. I don't know if the sun damages them or the weather or what. I assume they become less pliable over time.  Good idea and decent mount....but the suction cups fail after about a year of use. Not  a bad product...but one needs a large supply of the suction cups as replacements.  I prefer a fixed mount for my escort radar detectors.

$review_text.: These our great sounding ear buds and I will probably order more. I don't know how it happened as I am not hard on things and do not use these for any type of strenuous activity, but they short out from time to time. For the most part I use them plugged into desktop speakers while at work, but occasionally I use them while riding the trains. I noticed that I was only hearing sound in one ear and reached for my player to see what was going on. When I moved it the sound came back and I realized that the thicker casing leading up to the jack had to be set in just the right position to keep it working. Maybe I bent the cable or maybe it was weak design, but they still work for use at my desk and the sound quality is still amazing.Update: I am upgrading to 5 stars as I recently found out that my MP3 player is the problem and not the earphones. I recommend these to all my friends.Update: 12/30/11Amazing quality. I have to agree that these sound better the more you use them.

You can power cycle the router and things work for a few minutes but then it's the same deal all over again.I am experimenting to dumb down the security to WEP, limiting supported bands to G+N  to find a combination that will stay up for a while.Would not buy again :(

$REVIEW.: This lens is a great telephoto for the price. You can't beat the price ($399 at the time of this review - $449.99 - $50 rebate). The lens is very sharp and takes great pictures. It is slow in the dark or shadows ... meaning if you try to even auto focus on something in a room at night without a lot of light then you will have problems ... not a good low-light lens ... also a heavy lens due to size and VC ... noisy VC. I give it four stars however for it's VC and zoom capabilities - as for this price you won't find any better.  I will use this lens for kids sports (indoor with light and outdoor), the zoo, wildlife, portrait, and general close-ups.As another note, I use this lens on a Nikon D90. I have seen another comment on here about it not exposing correctly on the D90. I have not had any problems and exposure has been right on, with and without a speedlight sb700 flash at all apertures and focal ranges.You can view some of my pics taken with this lens here: [see comments section](UPDATE 11/30/2011)After taking a bunch of indoor shots of my niece's gymnastics meet, I reduced my rating to 4 stars. Although I do love this lens, it is not so great wherever there is not direct light (i.e. sunlight) - it is extremely slow focusing sometimes and you must also adjust the shutter speed and/or ISO accordingly which will give some blur or grain for any indoor action shots. Although the slowness is not a defect of the camera, it is inherent within the wide-open end of the aperture range F/4-5.6 . The drop of the star is for the slow focusing in anything but pretty bright light. It is still IMHO one of the best zooms for the price that is out there. If you need a zoom for low-light to medium-light action shots, better save major $$$ and pick up a 70-200mm F 2.8 or whatever.(Update 8/26/2012)I had this lens out again today. I would say it qualifies for a 4 to a 4.5 . I love the optics and everything is great except the slow focusing. I mean it hunts sometimes even in shade when it is sunny out. No other Nikon 3.5-5.6 lens I have does this. I'm not talking dark here. If you read other reviews by googling: "tamron 70-300 VC slow focusing", you will see what I mean as others state it can be slow. I have taken excellent pictures of birds and wildlife with this lens. It is true though that unless you are shooting in bright to semi-bright conditions or using a strobe, you may wish to take a look at a f/2.8 fast lens. Just be forewarned it's possible you may miss a shot or two if you need to focus in overcast or darker conditions. Is it worth the price? Absolutely and I would buy it again and again!(Update 4/30/2013)I have been extensively shooting this lens at the zoo, on vacation, mostly wildlife and sports, mostly now on my D700 FX camera. Although it is true that the focus can hunt in darker conditions, this lens is superb for the cost. The VC is outstanding and I love how the image does "freeze" in the viewfinder. I paid $399 for this lens and it is worth every penny of that. This is probably my "best" lens although it may be one of the cheapest. I got my "bang for the buck" out of this baby. Lightweight and a lot of utility, especially on my FX D700. I am increasing the rating to 5 stars. This *should* be my final update.

$review_text.: The actual storage capacity is around 59gb which is to be expected. Even on USB 2.0 ports this thing is fast, I haven't done any benchmarking so I don't have an exact figure but it's enough to be worth the price to me. Plenty of capacity for carrying around anything you need and fast for less than $1/GB, seems like a deal to me. Been running it almost daily for 6 months and it's still working great. Unfortunately, some people where I work were caught stealing business information so no we aren't allowed to write to external drives, which means one of my largest uses for this drive is now gone. However, I've used it to run movies and music when plugged into a PS3 and it does both flawlessly.

 I snapped them up


When they arrived I plugged them into several different sources and each time was pleasantly surprised at the accuracy of sound reproduction
Solid &#34;thumping&#34; bass, not booming, great presence and crisp mids and highs
 I was using a pair of Bose OE2i headphones before these Harman Kardon CLs


 The HK wins hands down, in sound accuracy, style and comfort


 The flat profile of the on ear cups I especially like

They work with my all my Apple gear, iPhone, iPad and iPod classic 

 Included is a second metal head bow if your head happens to be a little large

 I've worn these for hours at a time without any discomfort.The price has been reduced so if you're looking for a good set of &#34;cans&#34;..
they are worth the $90 bucks they are selling for now.

$review_text.: First, lets start with the great. It does a great job of protecting the XOOM. It does rub on the edges when you're opening and closing the case, but those rubs buff right out in my experience. I like the design. For the level of protection it gives, I think it is reasonably thin and has some nice style although not fashionable per se.I mainly use it in the low angle or flat settings. I do wish I could set the angle with a little more security. It isn't prone to slip out of the angle easily, but it can. When open, the XOOM isn't going anywhere. It fits snugly into the case.Moto really missed on not including some sort of access (a flap?) for charging/USB/HDMI. It really doesn't make any sense to me why they wouldn't include those. I will probably try making my own flap at the bottom for this one. Overall, I would definitely recommend the case.

$REVIEW.: I honestly consider this a must-have for anyone with an iPhone. I got the New Trent iFuel about a week ago and have already used it to recharge my iPhone 3GS three times, and the battery pack still looks like it has a full charge. I wish I'd had this the whole time I've had my phone! It's so nice being able to recharge my phone quickly without searching for an outlet or a spare computer.It comes with several cable adapters that look like you can use it with about any reasonably modern cell phone, so I love that I can probably also charge my mom's phone for her in a pinch. If you're charging your iPhone, you just use the USB cable that came with your phone (or iPod or whatever). To charge the actual battery pack, you use the retractable cable included with the iFuel, but you plug that into the little AC power charger/adapter that came with your iPhone or iPad. Super easy. (And also small and kinda cool-looking.)So far, I'm really pleased with the purchase. I realized after I bought it that for a little more money I could have gotten one that charges my iPad too, so if you have an iPad you might want to check that out. But seriously, anyone with an iPhone (which I LOVE), knows the batteries aren't great (especially if your phone has a little age on it), so this is something you probably need. I think it's really great. Highly recommended!

$REVIEW.: (I've also put this review under the Kindle Fire HD)  I'm not one to typically write reviews but since I spent a long time researching the right tablet for our family I thought I'd give my opinion.  First, the main use for our tablet was for the kids to play apps (fun and educational) and watch movies/shows.  I wanted to be able to download movies/shows so they could watch them on the plane or if we didn't have wifi access  I also plan to use it for books for them and me.  I have other Apple products but didn't want to spend the money on something that the kids would primarily be using.  With that said I narrowed my purchase down to the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 and the Kindle Fire HD.  I actually bought both and tried both for a few days.  I read many reviews and most said to go with the Galaxy.  BUT, in the end I liked the Kindle Fire HD much better and here were my reasons:1.  I thought the screen quality was better on the Kindle Fire HD (it is amazing!!!).2.  The screen size was a little wider.3.  The interface was much more user friendly with the Kindle.4.  I'm a big Amazon Shopper and it just made more sense to go with the Kindle plus I plan to keep the Prime Membership up after the trial.  Like that you can borrow a book a month, get free streaming of tons of shows and movies, free 2 day shipping), lots of free books.5.  Supposedly there are many less Amazon apps than on Google Play but this has not been an issue with us at all.  All the apps we want are available on the Amazon store.6.  The big seller for me was the 16 gb internal memory versus 8 gb for the Galaxy.  Also, in reality the Galaxy only has 4 gb internal memory because half it taken up already by the operating system and other stuff that is loaded that you can't delete.  I do understand that there is the option to get an external SD card and in fact I have one but, FIRST, you can't store any apps on it only photos and movies, SECOND, it is a royal pain to transfer stuff to the extSD Card (you have to plug the tablet into the computer, transfer the files onto the computer and then put them back onto the tablet into the extSD card section.  Weird!)7.  So, even though the Kindle Fire HD with 16 gb is really only about 13 gb I like the fact that it has almost 3 times more internal memory8.  The Kindle felt of high quality build.9.  I have family members with the Kindle so we can share some books (not as many as we hoped but still a neat feature).10.  Battery Life better with the Kindle Fire HD.11.  Sound better too with Kindle.So, these are my 2 cents for what it's worth.  I liked the Samsung Galaxy but I loved the Kindle Fire HD for what we wanted to use a tablet for.  Happy shopping.  I don't think you will be disappointed with either one!

Okay, minus one star for comfort.I hope I don't end up taking more stars away for comfort!!  I will test for 2 hours and let you know.I could use just a smidget more clarity in vocals and highs for my taste, but whose complaining.For $10 Nobody should be complaining about Bass, these little rockers are worth every penny and then some in that category.My main concern was clear bass in a cheap set of ear buds.  And guess what?  I got exactly what I bargained for.I definitely can't listen to these above 1/2 way for an extended period of time.  The mids are good and the highs are descent.If these break at least I know which brand/model of cheap earbuds I can trust.These sound way better than the cheaper $5-$6 Panasonics that got good reviews?  I gave those 2 stars that I will use as temporary backup only.These have more bass than most of the lower end $12 or so Skull Candy.I was tempted to buy the JVC HAFX1X, but for a savings of $7-$8 these cheap $10 ear buds are great.If these break I might.....I want to try the Gogrooves and JVC Hafxix to compare against these little buggers.Still on search on the best cheap earbuds that I can give 5 stars.
$SUMMARY.: Small Price to pay for BIG BASS

Since they are really cheap, I give them a five-star. Dad's really happy with them.

It fits other models, but not my primary rigs. This is disappointing because my previous Targus backpack which did fit those laptops was so well-used and worn it is finally falling apart and I wanted to give more business to Targus, but alas I do not want to buy the same backpack a second time...Three stars because it is a solid bag and one I will use for other purposes; it would have been five if it had fit my laptops.

$review_text.: For a company like Bose to charge $140. for a pair of cheaply-made headphones like these takes some arrogance & presumptuousness, but then to not stand behind their faulty product when it fails is just contempt for their (sucker) customers and is nothing short of shamefull.Yes, they were just out of warranty when I contacted Bose about them, but unless I paid quite a bit more money to them (I think it was $55 or $60) they were unwilling to do anything to correct the problem.Thank goodness for Sams Club, where I'd purchased them: in frustration I took them back there and .... without a word they just refunded my purchase price.  Wait a minute:  yes, they DID have a few words for me:  "I'm sorry for the inconvenience."  What a difference in customer service, eh?I must say the headphones, while they were still in one piece, performed reasonably well.  I liked the deep bass and especially the comfort: there's not many headphones that are still comfortable after 3 hours of wearing them.  And they even made the music from my iTouch sound pretty decent, which is almost a miracle.But after my experience with Bose about this defective product, I swore never to consider their brand again:  it's for posers, nothing more.
$SUMMARY.: Nice sound but so cheaply made it's unbelievable!

$review_text.: I received this device yesterday via Amazon prime free 2 day shipping
Side note; I've had Prime for about 3 years now and love it
I'd be happy to order everything this way rather than go to dirty, overcrowded, rude stores like my local Walmart and most other stores.Moving on.This device works great for me, for its intended purpose
My application is a Dell OptiPlex 755 with a Radeon 7750 video card


The kids wanted to have two monitors each, a since in had some extras I gave it a try

The video card is an important aspect here because it has one VGA  connection as well as one HDMI connection and the card supports dual monitor setups


I think its important to state that fact because some of the other reviewers who said it didn't work for them are probably misinformed about how this simple device works and the requirements your system need to passes in the first place

They could be plugging this device into an integrated video connection or possibly another video card that is not active on their system
There are so many variables that should be considered before reviewing an item like this.This specific device plugged into the Female HDMI output of the video card and the other connecton on this device is a Female VGA which connects to a very common Male VGA connection on common older monitors


Make sure you screw this connection together just like you would / should when you connect a VGA connector to a computer directly

They can and will eventully wiggle apart even if you don't think its possible.Once connected I turned on the computer and turned on the lower to both monitors.In my situation both monitors displayed immediately and correctly


Your setup may be different but I think its unlikely this device would be the issue.More to consider:In my situation one monitor showed the usual desktop with icons while the second monitor displayed the usual desktop background picture but there are no icons or a windows button

You open programs on the one monitor and then drag them to the other monitor

One example could be that you watch a YouTube video on one monitor and shop Amazon on the other

Maybe even watch Amazon video on one and shop the other.If your mouse will not appear on the screen when you scroll off the screen towards it try scrolling the opposite way


If that works then you need to make a setting change in windows to tell windows that the extra monitor is to the left of the first monitor or on the right, whatever your situation is.I don't know what chip black means in the description but apparently has something to do with HP laptops

I have an HP laptop and I will update this review if I try this device with it.This works great, is a great price, and I'm purchasing another to have on hand.

This was very useful.The stand worked as promised. Only one angle, but it worked well for me!My only gripe with this product is that it had obvious signs of wear on the corners and along one side of the back of the case after a month of use. The finish on the outside rubbed off, leaving a shiny finish on the outside. Aesthetically, it did not look very good, but to me that isn't really important. I took off 1 star of my rating for this issue.

She kept having bubbles when she tried to place it. When she finally got it on the screen was so difficult to move across that we can barely use the touch screen. It is not at all smooth and she goes through a stylus a week trying to play games on her kindle while fighting against the screen protector. I do not suggest anyone buy this product.

$review_text.: Found a great deal on this frame around Christmas and bought a couple of them.  What drew me to this frame was the higher resolution than most frames in this size, and Viewsonic's reputation for quality monitors.Overall I'm quite pleased with the frame.  While memory cards are inexpensive, having a generous amount of internal memory is a bonus.  I resize my pictures to match the vertical resolution of the frame.  This prevents the frame from having to resize the pictures and allows me to store many more pictures on the frame than I would have before resizing.  I figure I can store about 6000 pictures in the frame's internal memory by doing this.  It also gives me control over the resizing process as the frame doesn't have to perform this function.The resolution and color depth of the frame seem to be quite good.  I don't see any banding like I've seen on cheaper brand frames.  The resolution is perfectly adequate for a frame of this size and the pictures look sharp and detailed.Some reasons for the four star review instead of a five:  The controls are a little tricky to figure out.  I had to read the manual to figure out how to get some of the settings to work.  The remote is nice but the frame responds fairly slowly.  I also notice a bit of a blue cast in many of my pictures, particularly with skin tones.  It could be my pictures but I don't see it on my calibrated monitor.  I haven't found how to adjust this so I may have to adjust my pictures.  It's minor and most people don't notice such things, (unless you read this review and are now looking for it, sorry) but I guess I do.  And I agree that the mat color is too light.  For photos that fill the frame it's fine, but for those that don't, it makes the black bars stand out more.Overall I'm very pleased with this frame.  It's allowed me to liberate those thousands of digital pictures stored on my computer that no one ever sees.  It doesn't force people to sit though an hour long slide show or flip through endless photo albums.  You just leave it running somewhere and people see a new great picture every time happen to look at it.

$REVIEW.: This is a 'pre-review', before the part even gets here, due to some incredibly ridiculous (in fact, downright suspicious) behavior on Amazon's part already in the 'posting' and 'shipping' steps of this order.This was a three-item order, and I'm leaving this identical review on all three parts for now, as I'm really upset about the delay on this order.I've never seen anything like this before on Amazon, or, for that matter, anywhere.The order took no less than SEVEN WHOLE DAYS to even 'post'--it took THREE DAYS to even charge my card (the same one I've used for every other Amazon order I've made over the last 4 or 5 years).By the 3rd day, I emailed Amazon, and received the most ridiculous reply, ever, from any sales site, amounting to this:'Amazon takes their sweet time on purchases made with debit card, if you want to hurry things we can cancel the order, sell you a gift card, and remake the order to process it that way.&#34;Again, I've never had such a lag on any card, or any payment method (it finally posted a legitimate tracking number today, 7 days after I made the order), on ANY site, much less Amazon.If this happens again, I'll be hunting another site to make my purchases, and frankly, I myself am surprised at how much I've been buying on Amazon lately--and I'm sure I'm not the only one this has been tried on, so I'm not sure of Amazon's stability, long-term, anymore, and maybe it's best to start shopping around for another auction site--they've now slipped below the eBay level, so I'm really disappointed.I'll ADD MORE to this review after I actually get the items (the delivery date even changed during this lapse, adding an entire WEEK to the shipping time--honestly!), and like I said, Amazon is dropping from my #1 search/shop site, to around 3 or 4 for now, until I see signs they're improving (not just holding the status quo).

It looks pretty big when you open the box it came in. Not something your wife will want to carry in her purse when you travel.Inside:- The inside has a netted area to hold your 5" GPS and also has a large space to store the GPS cables and even your manuals.- I could see storing the GPS in this case when not is use but while traveling I have purchased a thinner case with stiff sides that my wife doesn't mind putting in her purse.

Works great, drill a 3/4" hole where you want to mount it, just push it into the hole, very tight fit, doesn't come loose.  Also, just to mention if you want to install in a car that doesn't have a usb port to plug this into, your going to have to do a little work. Car accessory ports are 12v and USB is 5v.  So if you think your going to just cut the end off and tap into your existing wiring, hopefully you will believe me; I tried, doesn't not work. You going to have to purchase a USB cigarette adapter, take it apart disconnect the metal pieces from the board for the negative and positive and solder on wires and tap those into your accessory wiring.  Then just plug the USB into it and you have a perfect charging usb port.  Also tested another android device, charges fine.

I have a siberian husky (which means a lot of fur floating around) and I have not had a big problem with fur sticking to the cover.

$REVIEW.: Have had this for a couple of weeks and it works great
I wanted a wifi router with gigabit Ethernet ports on a cable Internet connection- this seems to fit my expectations well


I run a multi-platform (Windows XP, 7, Linux) small home LAN and nothing has had issues connecting and maintaining connections with it wifi or wired

Speaking of wifi, connection is noticeably more stronger than a previous D-Link router (very old) it replaced
No options to tweak transmit power in the setup, but I don't need to anyway.Very simple set up, which is good for most folks, but won't please all


I was hoping to do more tweaking with OpenWRT or other open source firmware options but this router typically isn't supported with other firmware and doesn't seem like it ever will be completely so (despite having open firmware itself).Overall happy I made the purchase- price was very cheap online compared to retail and even OEM shops in my area.

Note: I see that the Delkin express card adaptor has the same problems so don't bother with that one either.  I'm returning mine to Amazon for a refund.  It's been a LOT of trouble and frustration for me.  I have the IOGEAR 3 Gbps eSata 2-port Express Card adaptor that I plug my external HD into and that works fine with my MBP so I don't know what's wrong with this Compact Flash adaptor.

$REVIEW.: For $13 what should I have expected.  It magnifies, but small sight picture.  Rubber coating seems to be much thinner than anticipated.  Optics not the clearest, but then again it is not a Nikon or Swarovski either.  Not a bad optic for your kids- if they loose it or break it your not out much.  I will give to my son and eventually get a better one, probably a spotting scope or much better set of binocs.

$REVIEW.: This is my second time ordering a folio case for my MacBook Pro Retina and the second disappointment.  The case fits nicely on the pro; the latch is in the way of the track pad so you must tuck it under the computer before use, not really a big deal but worth mentioning.  The inside material feels nice but the grey color made it look cheap.  It didn't protect the back sides of the computer, which is one reason I purchased a case in the first place.  The overall look of the case is nice but feels very cheap.  My wife purchased the Sena folio for her Mac Air and I was hoping for a close match but the Elite in my opinion was just a cheap copy of the Sena.  Not the type of case I&#8217;m going to wrap around my $2000.00 machine.  I guess I&#8217;ll for out the $180 for the Sena and hope it&#8217;s as good as the one for the Air.

$REVIEW.: Why we picked this one vs all the othersThe compartment is big enough to fit all the components that came with my DVD player (remote, cables, small dvd case - 24pk)I like that this flips open - to sit horizontally on an arm restI like that this flips open vertically too to latch and sit between car seats. There is a strap that secures your DVD player in the case.OTHER USES:I've hooked this on the back of my passenger seat so my kid has full front view - super easy to do!I've also used the straps to strap this sucker to the snack tray of my stroller. We wrap the straps criss cross over the DVD player and the case, then use the tether straps work to hitch underneath the foot stand of the stroller and keeps it even more secure. (This has helped me get some shopping done at the mall).It's nice and compact and fits all of the gear!

$REVIEW.: UPDATE April, 2013:  I sent the thing back to Apple briefly after I wrote the review

 I wiped it and explained how I was losing WIFI from time to time

 They updated the software, returned it and stated they could not duplicate the issue

 It still loses signal

 A friend has the same device and it happens to him as well
 So, you goto Settings, toggle WIFI and it works again
I'm okay with it, but expected more from Apple

 Therefore, I can not recommend this product and am dropping one star from my review.I bought an iPAD 2G about a month ago, and pre-ordered the iPOD Touch 5G, which arrived last week


 Previous to that, I've been a PC guy with horribly cheap cell phones.The Touch is nice, small form factor, I like the lightning connector


 Although I've played with it quite a bit, downloaded lots of apps, for the most part, it sits in my shirt pocket streaming Pandora over my Big Jambox.It's important to remember, Apple spends lots of time and money on research and marketing
 Some of the features missing from this little device are intentionally not available
 They would rather you purchase their Flagship products
 That noted, I offer the following:The larger screen is nice, it looks a bit cramped loaded with icons; I only load 16 to a page

 The battery meter will not show percentage of power remaining


 I don't really have a problem with that as I keep an app running in the background


 Not everything works in landscape mode


 I really wish the main screen did


 Also, Facebook does not work in landscape, although the photos do
 The keyboard is horribly cramped in portrait mode-- I'm constantly hitting the delete key instead of the letter M; I carry a stylus


 Yes, the speaker is tinny, but that's acceptable for my purposes
 I like the new ear pods, but you may be surprised to find the ones packaged with the iPod lack the mic and mute button


As the screen is so small, I have no problem with the resolution

 Netflix and streaming tv shows look good


 I'm waiting for the market to catch up as I'd really like a tripod stand
 I'm having problems with Pandora locking-up after a few ads play

 I imagine one of the companies will offer a software upgrade to resolve that issue

 I do not have the same problem with the iPAD and both devices are utilizing IOS 6.0.1.It is a very good device


 But for those who may not need a small unit and are on the fence considering a Touch or an iPAD,  I recommend the latter.

$review_text.: This is my first fully built computer. Made it into a Hackintosh/gaming computer. Wasn't sure what I wanted, but decided to go with this case. Its open, well cooled and has more 2.5/3.5&#34; and 5.25&#34; drive bays than I will ever use. The included fans are quiet, and have a light bluish tint on the LED's that are incorporated in them. The side panels each come of with two easy to use thumb screws and both are puffed out on one side to give you more room for wiring and the other to include a nice large 200mm fan. The top also pops off with a simple press to open it up completely. Every body panel is metal, not plastic.Each drive bay comes out very easily and sections can completely come out in case you had some crazy graphics card thats extremely long. Each drive bay can also easy mount your standard hard drive or SSD. I personally have 2 SSD's and a HDD in it as well as a DVD burner up top, and have quite a bit of space to load many more.The front of case incorporates two USB 3.0 ports as well as a rare Firewire 2.0 port and your standard speaker, microphone ports. Also your standard power and reset buttons as well as a button to turn off the LED's and a simple fan control slider. Also has a small tray above all of these to hold say a USB thumb drive or two.It isn't the most awesome amazing looking case ever. Your dude bros on some website will surely have something that looks better. It might be less practical piece of cheap plastic and louder than yours, but damn it it has graphics and windows!

$REVIEW.: I've only had this a few weeks but so far, it is working just fine.Another reviewer complained about it not working in a HP case and at first, I had the same problem. But the problem was that all adapters and slot blocks have to be aligned precisely. All that was necessary was to release the single lock for all the adapters (this is a tool free HP Z420 case) and line them up correctly. Then the card would properly align in the slot with no problems connecting cables.What would I do differently, if I were designing the card (of course, it might be more expensive):1. for a 4 slot card, use horizontal rather than vertical lots as that would just make life easier for the users2a. for vertical slots, provide 7 slots--or--2b. for vertical slots, also provide 3 Firewire 800 slots (I'd pay another $30 for a card with this feature)

$review_text.: I bought this mp3 player for my car as the color matched my dash and it has a micro sd slot.  However, after playing it, I chose to use a better mp3 (Sony Walkman NWZ-S544 Series 8 GB Video MP3 Player) as the sound is at least 10 times better.  This player is ok if you want a small "you get what you pay for" player.  The usb cord that comes with it is only about 6 inches long which is kind of a pain no matter what computer you connect it to for charging. The headphones that come with the player can be thrown in the trash; they really are of cheap quality and sound horrible.  When connected to the player, there was some static; that's sad for a brand new device... The screen is rather small and can't be read if using in a vehicle.  The button setup is ok and I like that is has a micro sd card slot.  Unfortunately, it just doesn't have the quality of the Sony mp3 player.

The interior is soft and there are small pockets inside and out for a few small cables, a battery, and an extra SD card or two.  My Fuji FinePix SL1000 fits snugly in the bag, but I am unable to use the interior pocket for anything other than an SD card because the camera is so large.

$review_text.: First off, I love Canon Powershots because of the image quality and design and function
But secondly, I love Canons because they make the best underwater housings for most of their models


They are good to 130ft, which is better than most
And, really, most recreational divers would have little reason to dive beyond 130ft


I have taken it to as deep as 91ft

I shot some amazing video in addition to still shots, and everything on this housing works the way it should
The flash diffuser (the translucent piece that attached around the lens port) is very helpful in improving the quality of your flash shots by softening the light


For any recreational use, especially if you are a diver, this is a must have

And it is way cheaper than getting an Ikelite housing, for example


Unless you must have external strobes

I'll also use the housing when I am in adverse conditions, just to protect it sometimes


It's a bit bulky to bring with you on trips, but any housing would be


This one is pretty compact if you put it on that scale.

$review_text.: For some reason I spent more time reading reviews for a product at this price point than I usually would and, as a result, ended up making what I feel is a pretty good purchase decision.  As some have pointed out, the big negatives for me on this camera is the on-device playback capability and lack of internal memory.  The playback feature is overcome easily enough by connecting it to a TV with the included cable or to the computer to transfer the video (which is a really smooth feature with the included software).  The memory is issue is overcome by adding an SD card but you just need to factor the price of that in along with your camera when considering clicking the Buy button.Overall, I'd suggest the product and am happy with it as my first "flip video" type device.

$review_text.: cI sometimes tire of headphones or earbuds and purchased this rechargeable speaker to hook up to my iPod Classic or my most recent purchase of a Samsung Galaxy media player.It charger through your computer's USB port and my record so far is using it constantly for 7 hours.  And if you plug it into a computer's USB port while using it, it will charge while it is playing music.  The amount of volume and quality of sound really is quite amazing when you hear it. It has a built-in cable with a standard 1/8&#34; jack to plug either into your music/sound device and an additional cable wound in the bottom so that you can hook them up in a chain.  For such small speakers they really do produce a good quality sound overall...and when you hook 2 of them together the sound will fill a small room easily.  That's the Prs.  There are a couple Cons.  Those would be that 1) the cable to hook it up to your music device (MP3 player/computer/etc.) is only a couple inches long and i wish it was longer.  The same with a separate cable that allows you to connect it to another speaker of the same kind.  It's supposed to give you stereo sound according to the ad but when then speakers are 2 inches apart they are no where near far enough from each other to create a stereo effect (I went out and just purchase a standard extender cable for a regular 1/8&#34; stereo jack and it solved the problem but it would be nice if the cable were either longer or it came with the extension cable).  The 2nd con about these speakers is that they took the time to boost the bass but the upper range sounds a bit tinny.  Considering how small this speaker is I'm surprised at the quality of the sound.  Also, when you hook 2 of them together and spread them apart with an extender cable like I did it seems to fill the upper range a bit.  The question you frequently see when filling out reviews is &#34;would you recommend this item to a friend?&#34;  I would have to say yes and after searching, Amazon had the best price as of the time of this review.

$REVIEW.: I didn't intend to wait this long before writing a review for this TV but time flies by.I've been using this TV as my main living room TV for the past 3 years and it has treated me very well


I bought it in 2011 when they had it on sale for $899 and back then for a 3D TV that was one heck of a deal so I went for it

Everyone also thought that 3D was going to be more and more popular but I have maybe used the 3D feature on this TV under 10 times, I own one 3D movie and I played a few XBOX games in 3D but found it to be a hassle to get the glasses and TV setting just right so I haven't used the 3D feature the past 2 years.Overall the TV is solid and the picture is great, almost too great if you ask some people, it makes regular HD TV shows look like soap operas, very vivid and crisp picture


I've gotten used to it but every time a friend comes over they comment on it.I do really enjoy the Game mode because I do a lot of online gaming and there is a good difference you can see when the Game mode is on, hard to explain but overall great picture for almost any movie, TV show and video game.Cons: Only reasons I docked a few stars was: -1 star because of the SUPER glossy and shiny almost mirror like screen
You really need a blacked out room for this TV, so I did invest in a pair of darkening curtains since it is by a bay window in my house


It would work best in a dark basement without much light glare.-1/2 star because any movie, show or game with lots of dark scenes you do notice the almost burnt cells or cloudy grayish colored blots around the TV
A lot of other reviewers complained about this and it is a downfall for the TV but only during credits or really dark scenes, and still not too noticeable
However I have not seen a better TV for bright scenes and games this TV really pops with anything colorful and bright.-1/2 star because the TV smart setting that connects to the internet for updates, yahoo apps, netflix, etc

Not a huge deal because I hardly used it but just the fact I can't get updates bugs me and I feel like I'm missing out

There may be an explanation for this and I have not tried to hard to figure it out because again, I hardly use it.Overall for the price I have been happy with it and it has treated me well, but it may not be the TV for everyone

With how many new TVs come out every year and how cheap they are getting I plan on waiting a good long while before replacing this one.

$SUMMARY.: After 3 years its been a good TV

$REVIEW.: I've been using a normal 7200 rpm hard drive forever.  I heard that this would provide a serious bump in speed, but didn't really believe the hype.I was so wrong.  This hard drive has been amazing!  I purchased it about a year ago and have had zero problems.Installation was a snap, though it has a 7 mm form factor for putting into thinner laptops.  My laptop has a 9 mm bay so I needed to get some shims for it (I ended up making them out of cardboard, I've had no issues).After that, installation of Windows 7 was a breeze and getting everything up and running was a snap with a driver recovery disk (I'd make this before you pull your old hard drive if it is still working).Then the fun started.  My boot up time is a few seconds, and everything seems to just run with more ease.  Things pop up almost immediately.A wonderful example is Photoshop and and Adobe Bridge.  I do a ton of photo editing and this is where my biggest gains have been noticed.  Photoshop opens without a second thought, the same as bridge.  All of the raw photos previews in bridge are instantaneous and opening them happens in the blink of an eye.  Previously there was a TON of waiting around for these things.Its only 250 gigs, but I've had no problems with that.  I have an external hard drive where I keep my music and back up RAW images.  Everything I'm working on I simply keep on my laptop and then move when I'm done with it.  About 1/3 of the drive is filled.I'd heartily recommend this to anyone looking to upgrade from a spinning platter hard drive!

SO after searching on Amazon for a solution I was pleased to see this cord for a very cheap price. I hooked it up and now I feel like it has given my G5 new life. I use XBMC with the G5 and the cord pumps beautiful 1080p hd to my LG TV. The colors are great and there is not flickering at all.

$REVIEW.: I have been using this lens for the past three weeks.  Mostly to shoot local league Rugby, Soccer, and Baseball.  Let me say up front, if you do not have a monopod get one now.  The total weight of a A700 and this lens is about 4.5 pounds.  If you include the A700 grip you are lugging around about 6 pounds of gear.  For the images you get its is well worth it the weight.  For the bang for the buck this has got to be the best Sony lens out there.  With the 1.5x crop factor on most of the Sony DLSR's (only the A900 is full frame) this becomes an effective 105-600mm zoom.  It's used mostly at the 400mm (equivalent) setting and my shots are tack sharp even wide open.  Since I use this mostly for sports I keep the camera is in shutter priority setting, usually at 1/1000 or 1/800 of a second.  Focusing seems a bit faster with the built in SSM as opposed to the screw drive on the other lenses but not much different.  Because the SSM uses a bit of battery power you will experience fewer shots per charge.  The only negative about this lens is that when zoomed the lens does extend quite a bit.  I had hoped that it's length remained the same throughout the zoom range as my Tamron 70-200 F2.8 does.  But this is a small quibble when you factor in the image resolution and very fair price for a premium lens.  Another plus, the silver finish really looks great.  It really stands out nicely when I'm in the press box with the Canikon crowd.

$review_text.: *****The Sony A57 is a DSLR (digital single-lens reflex) with interchangeable lenses and a maximum density of 16.1 megapixels


 It records and plays back video, and this package comes with an 18-55 millimeter zoom lens

 You can focus manually, and it includes auto-focus in still photography, of course, but also in video and even video during zoom.The A57 (where the "A" really means the lower-case Greek letter alpha) is a sophisticated camera suitable for many professional uses and most amateur use

 (A step up from the A57 is the A65, which boasts 24 megapixels, which is 50% more and which is suitable for most professional use and all amateur use.)As you'll see, I end up awarding 5 stars to the  Sony Alpha SLT-A57K 16.1 MP Exmor APS HD CMOS Sensor DSLR with Translucent Mirror Technology, 3D Sweep Panorama and 18-55mm Zoom Lens.Pluses-- In continuous exposure mode the A57 can rip off as many as 12 frames a second, which is really fast and which might help you improve your golf swing or your bowling delivery or your take-off as you're training for the Olympics in the standing high jump
 Each individual image is remarkably crisp, even if you have to move the camera a little to capture all the action.-- The still capture of low-light, no-flash scenes is remarkably good

 From all my other cameras I'd gotten used to blurry darkness, but the A57 shines in this problematic province
 (Shines, get it?)-- With my Nikon D5100 in video, when you zoom the movement of the motor or the lens elements or both is audible on playback as a clicking

 The same is not true of the Sony A57


 For this I add 1/2 a star, which makes it 5-1/2 stars so far.Minuses-- You cannot use the A57 to photograph aliens or ghosts
 I can't prove this, so you'll just have to take my word for it

 I do promise that my house is veritably inFESTed with aliens and ghosts, but this camera -- as with all the others I've tried, and over the years that's been a lot -- refuses to record them

 As you probably know, one of the characteristics of such entities is that they cannot be photographed, so the fact this camera cannot take their photographs or any video of them pretty much proves they're there, for which I thank the Sony Corporation so sincerely for being on my side.-- The A57 does not have a time-lapse feature, which I would have expected in a camera this costly


 Since much cheaper cameras offer this feature, I suspect this is an oversight and not the result of some software impossibility

 Because I happen to have found this feature useful in the past and expect to do so in the future, I subtract back that half a star.-- If you aim from ten yards away with a Marlin .22 rifle at the center of the optical from dead on, and if you hit it as you know I did if you've read some of the previous reviews about how accurate I am at shooting various products from ten yards away, the camera is instantly rendered useless


 At that point when you turn it on it always emits a little puff of smoke and then otherwsie completely 100% stops responding to your commands no matter what you do except that now when you shake it things move around a lot and some of them fall off

 I subtract no stars for this, I'm just letting you know the results of my tests

 Also, I have learned that this sort of testing is not, not surprisingly, covered by the warranty.*****Although I normally think of Canon and Nikon first when it comes to DSLRs, I will now add Sony to that list.*****

I expected that but some didn't. My only complaint is that it doesn't work 100% of the time. In the 15 or 16 months I've had it there have been a few times (only a few) where I turned on my computer and it wasn't appearing as connected. In those cases you might need to reboot your computer, sometimes reboot it a couple times.Anyways other than that I've got nothing to complain about, it stores my information nicely. a great companion for my MacBookPro which has a serious lack of HDD space (120 GBs).Absolutely the external to get.

$REVIEW.: My wife and I bought this camera to use initially as a nanny cam and then simply as a way to look and listen in on our son now that we are both back to work and miss him terribly.  So far the camera has been great.  It offers a very clear picture and really excellent sound.  We are able to hear what's happening around the whole apartment.  The manual made setting up the camera as simple as it can be which is still a bit complicated.  But if you follow the step by step process you should not have a problem.  Now we can both look in through our smartphones and have our very own website with a live stream of our apartment.  Can't ask for much else.  We can also record to the computer or record to a memory card but we don't use that feature much.  All in all with are VERY satisfied with this purchase.  Look into all the amazon vendors (including Sharx Security themselves) for the best price.

$review_text.: This charges my phones very slowly.  Also, the micro USB connector becomes loose, intermittently failing to make contact and charge the phone.  I have bought six of these chargers over time, all of them "shipped and sold by Amazon", all of them appearing authentic.This charges my Galaxy Nexus very slowly.  During a recent two hour drive, it brought the phone from 15% to only 75% charge (while listening to Audible).  Meanwhile, my home charger raises it more than 1% per minute, bringing it from 15% to 100% in just over an hour.  This charger is insufficient for someone who's in the car a lot, relying on their charger for power.What's worse, the micro USB connecter quickly becomes loose, failing to make contact with the phone.  You can plug this charger in and the phone won't charge!  After a few months of use, in order to reliably have it charge the phone, you need to push "up" when it's connected, forcing the pins on the roof of its micro USB connecter to press against the contacts of the phones micro USB port.In summary, I have to hold the charger in a specific position when connected to the phone AND do so for an inordinately long time since it charges so slowly.  As always, you get what you pay for EVEN when you buy authentic chargers "shipped and sold by Amazon."

$review_text.: I used this drive as a replacement for my Samsung SSD which was transplanted into my latest workhorse.  So this drive was chosen to keep my XPS M1530 from becoming a boat anchor.The drive seems quite fast, and quite silent.  Although my hearing is not acute, it is quite good.  For someone to actually hear this thing spinning, they must both have the hearing of a canine, and be working in a place so absolutely quiet as to defy description.  Or so that is my impression.  It also seems absolutely devoid of observable vibration, although those who have reported noise and/or vibration may have a laptop that mounts the drive differently and with less isolation - who knows.  I cannot find any such symptom(s) in my unit.That this drive can be had for fifty bucks seems unbelievable to me. Even though it is apparently based on older generation drive geometry, it is largely able to keep up with the latest tech drives, and is nearly on par w/the new hybrid solid state drives.But the -real- reason for taking this drive over those other speed demons is simply this: ZERO negative reviews.  Seagate can't even come close to making that claim, and neither can the others.  I don't need any drama from what is effectively the heart of my laptop computer - NO D-R-A-M-A.  So it may be that there are incrementally faster drives, but like when I asked a BMW salesman how reliable the M-Series cars were, he just looked me up and down and said that those people buying M cars didn't have reliability at the top of their priority list.WELL, I -do-.

$review_text.: I bought several of these because they are far superior to using a normal LM317 linear regulator circuit, and they are less expensive in the end anyway.  It would cost me more to buy the components to build a 3A linear regulator circuit (2x LM317, capacitors, resistors, potentiometer, protoboard and a heat sinks) than it cost me for one of these buck converters.In addition to saving me money, these are so much more efficient and have a more consistent output voltage than a linear regulator.  Linear regulators waste so much power just turning it into heat, which can be a real problem because they require bulky heat sinks and even still they can get hot enough to burn your fingers, melt plastic and just simply be a pain in the butt.These buck converters don't heat up at all with a 600mA load, and barely get warm to the touch with a 1500mA load.  You'll never have to worry about heat issues with these things.  The output voltage is very stable, and DOES NOT DROP AT ALL (seriously) as the load increases.Voltage and Current were measured with a FLUKE multimeter which is less than one year old:No Load:  Vo = 6.80 V500 mA Load:  Vo = 6.80 V1000 mA Load:  Vo = 6.79 V1500 mA Load : Vo = 6.78 VFinally, these are very small (a fraction of the size of a 3A linear regulator board) so they can easily fit into whatever device you are planning on using it in.  The PCB design is clean and simple, and its connections are clearly labeled.My only caution is that If you are planning on using these in a &#34;set-and-forget&#34; application which is sensitive to over/under voltage, I highly recommend that you put some hot glue over the trim pot screw after you set the output voltage.  I say this because it is all to easy to accidentally bump the trim screw and mess up the output voltage set point.

Windows, by default, will only allow you to format the card as exFat or NTFS. These formats will work for most new devices, but some may have issue.If you use FAT32 as the filesystem instead, you can use this card for older devices, and it still works great with Android.

$review_text.: Very happy with its video quality. 16GB records for hours and hours. Also the battery is very long lasting, almost lasts one full day of touring. The screen is touch screen and makes copying to computer a lot easier. Takes a standard usb 2 cable to copy stuff over. The inbuilt shutter cover is very useful and keeps lens clean. Awesome features. Highly recommend it.

$REVIEW.: Just received my Kodak PlayFull video camera the other day and I've run it through some test videos. Here are my thoughts:Pros:Decent price point.Compact enough to easily carry around in your pocket.Video editing software is not the most robust, but fairly easy to learn and does what you want it to, for the most part.Free 4 GB memory card.Waterproof (Scared to test this, myself!)Kodak Easy Share feature does make things pretty easy to send to your favorite social media site.Cons:Access door to USB plug is hard to open.Miniscule cord for the USB plug means that you'll probably want to run videos to your laptop or through a USB hub rather than let the camera dangle from the outside of your desktop computer.Video quality directly affected by ambient light. Video taken outside in daylight look great. Videos taken in low light, indoors, look fuzzy.Camera body surface seems to scratch quite easily.Software is installed from a website, not from a disk. Had to install it a couple of times for it to work, correctly.Video import interface menus are not the most user-friendly.No mount/port on the camera for attaching it to a tripod.This is my second Kodak video camera. I purchased aKodak PlaySport (Zx3) HD Waterproof Pocket Video Camera (Black)last summer, and I've had fun using that on family trips. I definitely prefer that one over this model, though this one has some good things going for it, too. I guess what it comes down to is that you tend to get what you pay for. Rugged or waterproof cameras are hard to find, and can be quite expensive. Comparatively, this one is a real deal. However, it also feels a bit cheap. It definitely feels less durable than my other Kodak video camera, though I'm not about to start dropping both of them to see which one stops working, first. If you need a budget video camera for your kids to use while they are out playing around with their friends, this is probably a good choice. If you are looking for something that is going to be primarily used for taking videos of your kids' indoor activities or family parties, this is not the camera you are looking for.Put simply, this is a cheap, play-around-outside camera. If that is what you need, this is the one for you (or your kids).
$SUMMARY.: A budget video camera with a free memory card and decent editing software...

$REVIEW.: The CPU fan went out on my Zotac Zbox mini PC that I use as a MythTV front-end. The fan was a custom part that they don't sell replacements for so the choice was to either scrap the PC or do a little modding.  So  following a guide online I cut the side out of the case and mounted this fan.Since this is sitting right next to my TV noise was an important factor and this fan exceeded my expectations.  At full speed it has an audible but fairly quiet noise, but the best feature is the speed adjustment knob.  I was easily able to find a speed that was completely silent yet still moved enough air to keep my little box nice and cool.  It's much quieter than the original fan.  I've been happily enjoying the silence while watching TV for the last 6 months with no problems
$SUMMARY.: Quiet and adjustable speed

$review_text.: I bought one of these, then had to go back to BB to purchase a LinkSys wireless router because my older Netgear wouldn't work with it. I must have spent 10 hours trying to get this thing working, from time to time I did have it working then the LinkSys router failed and I had to exchange it. Once the new router was up I once again went through the pain of programming the WRE54G but in the end it did nothing to extend my wireless network in our home. The laptop 100' from the wireless router and 10' from the WRE54G would constantly pick up the router instead of the Range Expander. The signal must be very small or non existent. I finally returned it to BB and purchased a Netgear WGXB102 54Mbps Wall-Plugged Wireless Range Extender Kit (available on Amazon) which I'm using now.The Netgear is a wired device that uses house wiring. I pluged one unit into the wall near the router, the other into the wall near the wife's laptop and bingo it was up and running. No setup, no hassle. It just works. If my wife unhooks the laptop and moves closer to the wireless router she still has a network connection. The little Netgear boxes work great!If you're curious go to Google and type in "WRE54G ip conflict" to see a lot of messages from people who've been trying to get this thing to work. It's a disaster. I suppose if you want to use it without any encription as an open network it might be easier to setup. However even when it was set up it didn't do what it was supposed to - Extend the Range of my wireless network.

$review_text.: I needed something that was moderately priced, well-made, and would allow me to carry my camera gear around

 This little backpack fits the bill!I'm not a professional photographer by any stretch of the imagination, but I do have nice(ish) gear that I want protected, particularly if I'm vacationing or traveling


 I have a Pentax k-x with a prime lens and a 300mm telephoto, a Canon HV30 with a gazillion gadgets and attachments, as well as the usual notepads, lens filters, flashes, etc


 I can fit just about everything in this
 The upside is that I can backpack with it and it doesn't look like a stealable camera bag.However, for those times when I need all of my stuff, this isn't quite large enough


 For instance, if I need my video light and my flash, and all of the lens filters, and the camcorder lens extensions and VideoMic and...

you get the idea
 For those times, I need a larger camera bag that doesn't look like a camera bag

 But for everyday use or for a casual weekend, this bag is ideal.

$REVIEW.: Just like NY Knicks sensation Jeremy Lin; This little tablet comes relatively out of nowhere and will become your MVP! I thank God that I didn't buy the Acer Iconia for $320.00. For under $140.00, the Coby Kyros will give you everything you're looking for -- but you will have to some work to bring it up to speed. I just received the tablet yesterday and immediately installed a 32GB microSD card to max out the external storage (you can't do that on an iPad, Kindle fire, or Blackberry Playbook), hooked it up to my wireless keyboard and mouse, and connected it to my television via its HDMI port (again, you can't do that on an iPad, or Kindle Fire).The device runs in a Cortex A8 1Ghz processor. It is single core. My 7125 is a resistive screen model, so it works best with a stylus (which it brings). If you strongly prefer fingers, get the model MID7127, which is about $20-$30 more, and has a capacitive touchscreen. The device comes with Android 2.3.3 installed, and a horrible little app store called "Apps Lib", from which you can get "GetJar". WHATEVER. Go online and you will quickly see that tablets of this design will install the Android Market, the Amazon market, the Amazon App store, the Kindle app, Flash 11, the Netflix app, and watch Youtube videos.The lack of a rear camera is not a deal breaker. The tablet is under $140.00, and a would be still be a steal at $200.00.

I am happy about the protection level of the case; the only things that can get to your phone are water and fine dust.

$REVIEW.: I received a sample of this as part of the Amazon Vine program. Because I didn't want to spend what I feel is an overpriced sum for an official Apple iPad sleeve or case (especially because the customer reviews of them don't seem all that enthusiastic), I bought a much lower priced generic netbook case. It's on the loose side but it at least is a case.  After that, I was offered another iPad case as a Vine program selection (not made by Apple) and I eagerly sent for it in hopes of getting something that fit better. That one was no better and in fact was just another generic netbook case that the manufacturer decided to sell as an "iPad" case to capitalize on the name.When I saw the Amazon leather sleeve as the Vine offering for this month, I thought maybe this time I will find something that actually fits an iPad.  Well, I am happy to say that this time I hit paydirt. The sleeve fits just right - it is not too loose and not too tight.  It is tight enough so that the iPad will not accidentally slip out, yet it is loose enough so that you don't have to worry about scratching the glass, or having to yank it out.The material itself is just like the product page description - sturdy, boot leather that is nicely and strongly stitched. The inside is lined with soft material. There is just the right amount of space at the top for your thumb and finger to grasp the iPad and pull it out. The "Amazon Basics" logo is tastefully etched in the lower right corner.The price for an item like this is fair considering the fit and materials, much better than some of the outrageous prices other companies are charging for cases and sleeves (especially when some of them are just relabeled netbook sleeves or cases that really aren't tailored specifically for the iPad). My only complaint is that the dark brown case doesn't match the black and silver of the iPad (black would be a perfect match) but hey, beggars can't be choosy.It's a nice sleeve - I am happy with it.

$review_text.: The set has nice features on the keyboard, and an excellent mouse


Setup was easy

Although it has not "broken" in a year's use, it:- Frequently disconnects when rebooting or going into sleep mode


You need a reset to get the keyboard and mouse to reconnect

I just bought a MS Wireless Desktop to replace the MX Duo and the MS Wireless has no such problems.- The shortcut keys do not work with Firefox (even though the keys on the MS desktop do)

Rather ironic, but it makes the MX Duo that much less useful.- Having used both, I like the MS Wireless Desktop better.

$REVIEW.: I have been using this Seagate 1TB portable hard drive for a few months now, and I am happy to report that it is a good quality storage device. I was a little concerned when I got it because I have always used Western Digital storage devices in the past, but so far, I am happy with this drive.The true test of a portable hard drive is longevity, and unfortunately, we won't know how it holds up for several years, but as far as actual usage is concerned, I am happy with this USB 3.0 portable hard drive.It is a little bit longer in size than most drives, but that appears to be due to the fact that the entire area where the USB cord plugs into the drive can be removed for use with other connections.I believe this makes it compatible with Thunderbird and other uses (for which I have no need, but I mention it because others might).The drive is quiet during operation, and I have not experienced it getting hot to the touch at all. The transfer speed is as expected for USB 3.0 (fast!), and it also works well with USB 2.0Overall, I think this is a quality drive and believe that it is a good purchase.

$review_text.: I really hesitate to write negative reviews, especially for decent products

 I also hate when people rate products poorly for reasons that are not the product or the company's fault
 I struggled with this one because the product itself is really decent
 I've had these cameras for a while to watch my pets when I'm away and I've even got some for friends


 They do the job well and you don't need to be an expert to get it to work
 I've updated the firmware once and unfortunately it required me to manually input the IP address instead of using DHCP but no big deal.Now for the reason for my low rating:  Business practices and customer service should figure into ratings so customers are aware of the total package

 I can't speak for customer service since I've never had to use it but...There are many review that cover this product itself, so I'll leave that alone


 The biggest problem for this device for me comes with their email communications


 Having the latest firmware updates and patches for an IP camera for me is as important as operating system patches

 If you don't want someone taking advantage of a security flaw and viewing your cams, you should update them
 Therefore, I've signed up for Foscam's firmware updates email list.Unfortunately, they take advantage of you and I receive at least one sales pitch or promotional email from them every day
 I specifically did NOT sign up for that list


 The list I signed up for was the firmware updates
 It is NOT COOL to take advantage of your customers by spamming them while holding the carrot of security firmware updates over their heads

 Even FREE antivirus software definition updates don't spam you just to get updates


 Do you hear this Foscam?  NOT COOL!!!You have disgraced an otherwise 4+ star product
 I don't even read your emails anymore unless they say "firmware update"


 (and I sincerely hope that doesn't mean you will start putting "firmware update" in your email subject lines just for me to open them.)  For a while, I was OK just deleting them, but this is getting ridiculous

 PLEASE, reverse this inappropriate and disturbing business practice!  I'd rate this one star purely out of emotion, but it is an otherwise decent product, so please do yourself a favor and stop ticking off customers who just want to know when there is an important update

 I'm willing to bet most people buying these cameras aren't corporations with large needs


 You're not selling bathroom tissue or paper towels where customers are going to say "Gee, I'm really glad I got that coupon for another camera in my email, I was fresh out!"  Make a good product, they will find you...the power of the Internet...use it for GOOD things only, not to spam your customers!!

$review_text.: This remote can only be programmed directly on the remote. There is no way to back-up or program with a computer. As long as you understand that, it's actually a very powerful remote. You can do a lot with the macros. The remote is on the heavy side, but it's not like you are going to be holding it for very long. It does go through batteries quickly - you will need to put in new batteries, either alkaline or rechargeables, at least once a month.After about 1.5-2 years, I started having major malfunctions with this remote. First, the entire remote would crash randomly and then restart. I could induce this crash just by shaking the remote. Next, the black face place came loose. There are very tiny plastic tabs that keep it inserted into the front of the remote, and these break very easily with normal use. You can here the broken pieces rattling inside the remote. Finally, and the last straw for me, is that some of the buttons stopped working. I've never had a remote with this problem. Searching online, it seems that cheaply made remotes can start to have problems with the contacts in the buttons due to whatever gunk seems to work its way inside the remote. I owned a URC MX-500 for 10 years that never had this problem.

$REVIEW.: With many manufactures creating desktop speakers for notebooks and desktop computers, many are now finding new grounds and markets in the mobile industry with smartphones and tablets taking over. The problem with many desktop speakers today is the fact that they require a 3.5mm stereo connection to plug right into the source device, whether it be a computer, phone, tablet, or television. To use the same set of speakers for multiple devices, the 3.5mm jack needed to be swapped into each device. Creative found the answer to this problem and built the T15 Wireless Bluetooth speakers. It works both wired with a desktop computer, and wireless via bluetooth with your phone or tablet.Upon receiving the unit, I immediately opened it up and began setup. The speakers are packaged very securely to insure no damage is done during shipment.. Hooking them up was super easy. There's an AC adapter that plugs into your home wall outlet, and a wire that leads to the left speaker which then plugs into the right speaker. Turn the volume knob clockwise lightly, and the speakers come to life with power. Connecting via bluetooth is also very simple. Press and hold the bluetooth button for 10 seconds, it's the big button with a blue LED light surrounding it. Once the LED light begins blinking on and off, you can search for devices using your phone, tablet, or computer. There's no pairing code, so it's simple and quick to connect to. I was able to connect to my smartphone within seconds and play music without any issues.As far as sound quality goes, it's quite impressive how well it sounds. There's no dedicated sub woofer like some speakers have, but the lower drivers on each speaker are large and deep enough to create some pretty decent bass for most songs. The sound is very loud and clear and has a good range of tones both high and low. These speakers actually work pretty good connected to a television set, and while no one's watching TV, they double as a sound system for playing music in the living room while taking up barely any space on the shelves.Overall, I recommend these speakers to anyone who wants good quality sound in their home for use with multiple devices.
$review_summary.: excellent speakers with high quality sound

$REVIEW.: I have had this lens for about 5 years and it is sharp, has excellent color, I can take great award winning floral shotsthat are amazingly sharp and colorful.  You have to shoot from about30" but you will get wonderful results, even when cropping down.  It is a lightweight, pretty fast focusing lens that works very nicely with a circular polarizer on a sunny day (some cameras don't work as easily as this one with a circl. pol.).  I get much better results from this camera than from the DA18-55 kit lens, because this 50-200 has such good range and has excellent color and sharpness at various F settings.  I have seen photos from others who use this lens with professional results so Ican vouch for it. Some lenses just have a very user-friendly and all-around excellence about them.  This is one of those lenses. I highly recommend it.  For around $200. you will get so much for so little!

$review_text.: The sound quality of course is not going to match your 2.1 speakers attached to your computer, but it's good enough.  The mic works well (i'm assuming) since people say they can hear me just fine.  As for music I didn't expect it to have good bass, which is doesn't, but that's not why I made the purchase.  I would assume the number one reason anyone would buy this product is because it's on the cheaper side wireless headset.  For that, this product is excellent, I've been waiting a long time for a wireless headset and finally bought this one and I'm very satisfied.Keep in mind these aren't my number one speakers, I only use them maybe 50% of the time while on the computer and I'm very happy with it.  Very simple to use, basically plug and play.  Battery life is good, comfort is acceptable.

$review_text.: This case not only was not exactly the same as the picture (the front showed the protector going around the home button and over the speakers, which the case I recieved does not) They have since updated the picture I see,  but the edges of the case do not line up correctly and at the top actually has a significant gap with a sharp edge which I filed with nail file so it would not cut my daughter until I can get her a different case. I didn't expect perfection for $2, but this was WAY off! It also comes off way too easy. If she dropped her iPod this case would come right off without protecting it at all.At this price it's not worth sending it back, but do yourself a favor and spend a little more money on a decent case.

$REVIEW.: because it swivels and rotates it can be a bit wild at times. Even though there are several &#34;notched&#34; areas for you to be able to prop your iPad up with you can NOT put it in the last one. It just falls down. When you close it you have to make sure you hear the &#34;noise&#34; that tells you it turned the screen off. If you pick it up from the spine side it comes up just enough that the screen turns back on. If you don't notice that your screen will stay on for a while draining the battery a bit more each time. Overall, it's OK but I will probably wind up buying something different in the future when it pisses me off one too many times. It's also not as &#34;purpley&#34; as I expected either.

$review_text.: After searching for several months and doing my research I've finally settled on this sling bag.  After looking at other stores and only finding expensive yet very cheaply made bags I decided to purchase this one.  Even though it cost a fraction of the price it's a good buy.  The ones I seen at the stores were made of very thin nylon.  This bag appears to be made of a thin canvas with lots of padding to keep my expensive camera and lenses safe.I fit my DSLR camera body with 18-55mm lens and lens hood attached.  With a additional 70MM to 300MM len, with assortment of lens filters, some macro lens attachments, one 2x telephoto lens, and a 45x wide angle lens, cleaning equipment, with a spare battery and charger.  And I have plenty of room to snare.All I can say is I like it.  It's very sturdy and fits all my equipment that I would need on the go.Only problem I had with it was, the inside was full of lint and pieces of plastic from the velcro.  Not good for a item that needs to keep things clean.

$review_text.: I like this lens quite a bit and would probably give it five stars if I did not also own the Zeiss 24mm 1.8. Obviously the Zeiss is much more expensive and has a larger (longer) profile, which means it is not suited for everyone or all situations. Which is where this lens can shine. I have found this lens to be just a tad softer than the Zeiss in direct head to head shots, but I do like this lens for it's smaller profile and have used it as my sole lens when I know I'll be capturing video as well as stills. There is really nothing wrong/bad/unacceptable about the results vs. the Zeiss - this lens is quite a capable performer IMO.For now however, the Zeiss 24mm 1.8 is the default lens on my NEX-6.
$review_summary.: Very nice lens for the price

$review_text.: I recently bought this camera as a replacement for my worn-out Pentax Optio S50.  Overall, I have been pleased with the Canon though it has a few little problems.Pros:-Very rapid turn-on and shoot time (about 1 second)-Short time between shots.  There is a feature that you can select where you can hold down the picture-taking button, and it takes one photo about every .5 seconds until you release the button.-Good control of manual features; you can take photos while using the function menu.  The menu is displayed on the side and bottom of the screen.-Optical viewfinder.  One of the biggest reasons why I bought this camera was because it had an optical viewfinder.  Most very portable cameras do not.  Optical viewfinders are not for everyone; they are basically only good if you take a lot of photos and you worry about the battery.  Obviously, buying an expensive spare battery negates this issue.-Nice movie features.  Even though it is not MP4 so the compression isnt great, the movie works great.  On the issue of compression, storage capacity is getting so cheap anyway it doesnt matter; i dont think anyone needs to be filming 1hr documentaries or something.  Anyway, there are two movie settings: the 30 fps is fine, and you can zoom while filming.  There is an even better (though more space-using) 60 fps for faster subjects.  One nice thing about the video is that you can still do different light settings; and in fact the camera adjusts light settings automatically.-Small. As small as any other compact camera, though the lens extends unlike some other ones.-Buttons work well.  They seem to be in the right place, press well, and just feel very good.  Some cameras have very annoying buttons.Cons:-Battery level unknown; I havent figured out how to know how much more battery life I have left.-Night settings TERRIBLE.  This is probably my biggest problem.  If you use either the autocamera settings or the night photo settings, they simply do not work.  You need to manually adjust the ISO and Exposure level.-Manual settings a pain.  When you change a manual setting they stay that way; there is no reset.  so you have to go through all of your manual settings to figure out what you have.-Zoom a pain.  The zoom function is clunky and inexact.  You spend a lot of time trying to get the zoom level you want.I can't say this is the best camera out there; obviously, there is no perfect camera, it's just a matter of picking what strengths you want and accepting whatever faults you can.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this drive for a HP netbook. The netbook originally had a 7200 speed SATA drive and received some slower speed ratings using the system ratings in Microsoft Windows 7. I performed a fresh install of Windows 7 on the first drive I received. However after rebooting the computer I received an error indicating the hard drive couldn't be found. Drive was bad and unseen in other computers also. I performed an exchange with Amazon and got a replacement drive sent out quickly. The second drive arrived and performs extremely well. I haven't had any issues with performance or the drive not booting. As I said originally I am using this drive in a netbook and it boots quickly and application load times are much shorter than with the old drive. Currently the drive scores a 7.8 in the performance rating within Windows 7.

$review_text.: I bought this for my boyfriend because he likes the heavier mice and was interested in a Microsoft one with weights but was warned off of it for other reasons. This one I found by comparing reviews and found it to be quite favorable.The downsides I remember hearing about where (1) the texture and (2) the cord being stiff.Well I use it often when I'm at his house and although the texture is weird, it takes maybe 5 minutes to adapt to and after that I've loved it, personally.  The cord has never been a problem for me or him.But I love it and kinda want it myself!  The heaviness with weights is awesome because it makes it have such a good solid glide. So responsive onscreen too and never skips.  Very adjustable settings too, even though I haven't played with those much since, well...not mine.Boyfriend likes it for the games and likes that it has all the buttons (though we both agree that the side buttons, while reachable, really aren't something either of us would use).  I don't game much, but even so I love this mouse enough for everyday use that I'll probably buy one for myself at some point when the price drops enough.

I've currently used it mostly for indoor flash-less sports photography and it's been great.  Nice high speed still photos that capture fast action cleanly and crisply.  Autofocus has been fast and accurate.  The wide aperture with long zoom makes for some very nice narrow dept-of-field facial pictures.One interesting note: when I ordered the lens from Amazon, the one I received had no lens hood.  Luckily I knew that was supposed to be there and Amazon replaced the lens without question (great service!).  Be sure to make sure the hood is present when you receive the lens.Strongly recommended!

$review_text.: Good:I am able to fit my (small) TomTom One 130-S into the case.Price is OK.How:I place the unit on one side, facing the case's side (as several people have pointed out). The suction cup has to be taken off and placed adjacent to the GPS. The power cord is adjacent to the suction cup. The usb cable is inserted behind the mesh opposite the gps and in line with the power cord. I am able to get the manual in behind the mesh.Bad:The photo shows 2 interior elastic straps but only 1 is provided. It's in the center so does not hold the gps in place (which is at one side). If the unit came as shown it would hold the parts better.The dimensions provided are inaccurate. The depth of the unit is only 1.5 " (approx) and this is the exterior dimension. Amazon shows approx 3" (which would have accommodated the suction unit attached to the main unit). The other dimensions are pretty close to the interior dimensions but not exactly. Addendum - I noticed that there are other dimensions provided within another area of the product description - this section does show 1.5" as the depth - but shows only 5" length - In short The seller needs to correct all references to dimensions and change the phot and references to 2 elastic straps)Conclusion.Based on the overall appearance (which is decent). The cost (OK) and the fact that I could get everything inside - I will keep the case hoping the zipper doesn't break from the slight pressure caused by the tight fit.However, I can't recommend it because of the error in the dimensions which may affect owners of slightly larger gps units than mine.I suggest you assemble all the parts you intend to place into the case and measure the depth, width and length of the bundle you create to be sure it will squeeze into the approx 1.5" depth 4.75" width and 7.75" length (approx interior measurements)

$review_text.: I've been using a Canon Camcorder HV10 3.1MP High Definition Mini Camcorder for years

I took it to Europe last summer on a transatlantic voyage on the Queen Mary 2

We drove around Germany and Austria with it and sailed back to the States, then traveled back across the country by car


I always had an extra charged battery in my purse
It took care of all my needs, and the battery capacity is such that I rarely needed a spare
I charged the batteries every night in my motel room to make sure they had  plenty of juice


I allowed one tape/day for heavy filming and kept a spare in my purse just in case
The camera always performed in a spectacular fashion

The sound quality is topnotch

And you don't have to shout to have the mike pick up your voice

The quality of the movies you take makes it look as if you're really there in Potsdam in front of the Cecilienhof or in the Mirabell Gardens in Salzburg

You can almost smell the flowers! It has the best hand grip of any camera I've ever used


Not only can you safely day after day carry the camera by the strap, you can insert your hand in the strap to hold the camera while filming

And you can learn to film with one hand as I've done many times in the passenger seat of the car while driving through scenery as spectacular as the New Forest National Park in the South of England or the Redwood National Park in California

From coast-to-coast, and from continent to continent, it's the best camcorder sold today.by Linda Cargill, author of Key to Lawrence

The frustration of using a wireless mouse that works intermittently deserves nothing less! Yes I tried replacing the battery thinking that maybe the battery was going bad and had the exact same result with a fresh battery, hence it's demise against a brick wall!!If you're thinking about buying this piece of garbage don't buy it, buy the Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 4000 instead

$REVIEW.: It does what it is designed to do, charges (in my case a Surface Pro 2).  However, the cord is way too short, shorter than the OEM.  I like that the converter is built into the plug in.  Like the original surface charger, there is a light, however as soon as you plug in the adapter, the light shines, unlike the OEM part.  The OEM part lights up when it correctly connects to the device and is charging.
$SUMMARY.: Functions as expected, but not a perfect item

$review_text.: This one is definitely "the little camera that could" yielding some very impressive photos for such a low price.  I like the manual focus adjustment in particular allowing me optimal clarity where I need it.  Also the nighttime and indoor photography is just second to none for such a little guy.  The one drawback has been the short battery life, but I'll give the high end and rechargeable batteries a workthrough see if I can mitigate that some.

$REVIEW.: I had the Lumix ZS1 I think it was called before this one.  The reason I don't totally remember the name is because I gave it to my sister after buy this camera and she loves it.  It was a great camera and still had a lot of life in it but I just wanted more.  I can take over 100 pictures a day, I have been known to take over 3000 during a special event.  I live up in the mountains by a lake, with deer and all kinds of wild life and a lake I can see from my deck.  My camera needs to be small to be carried in my purse and/or pockets.  I need it to work on the spot and have the best zoom ever.  Well saying all that, my Lumix ZS20 does all that, the zoom is outrageous for such a small camera.  I took a picture of the moon like it was at arm link and we all know how far the moon is away from us.  I could see ever crater on it.  I placed that picture on Facebook and no one could believe I took it with a pocket camera.  This camera takes picture like a high power, expensive camera.  The GPS is nice too, but I think it helps eat up the battery.  I did not like the battery that came with this camera or the charger so I bought me a 2 battery charger deal at a cheap price out here in Amazon and it works great and I bought a 16gb card.  I have not missed a sunrise/set  or deer picture yet.  And it take great grandbaby pics too.  It is a very easy camera to use and has professional settings for all you who like to set your own cameras to work how you want them to work.  Great buy.  Great camera.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this on April 4 of this year. It is now June 20th and the keys on the keyboard are starting to short out or something. First the s key wouldn't work, then it kind of flipped to the left shift key. Now the s works intermittently and the left shift not at all. So in all honesty, this keyboard is worthless to me because after years of typing, I'm NOT going to try to retrain myself to use the right shift or the cap locks keys to capitalize letters. And I don't know about you, but I fly on the keyboard these days and I really don't have time to go over everything to fix these types of mistakes because of a cheap keyboard. I always thought that LOGITECH good products and I'm not saying they don't, but this one stinks! I will give them another chance and just hope that this is a fluke, but if it happens again I'll be purchasing from someone else.

$REVIEW.: This is the third time I have ordered this product (one sized for the Sansa View and two sized for the Sansa Fuze). It fits perfectly, is reasonably priced, and the shipping time is fast. Some reviewers have noted that the silicone material collects dust but that's a problem simple enough to remedy by merely brushing it off or wiping it with a damp cloth.On several occasions, I have needed to remove the device from its protective case. At first, I worried that it would stretch out of shape or even rip but that doesn't happen and, each time the device is reinserted, it fits as perfectly as it did when new. My mp3 players take a beating since I use them daily, often in as many as three or four different environments per day, and I feel much more confident with them protected by this silicone rubber skin.

$review_text.: I got this product because of the size, expandability (now it can supposedly take SD Cards up to 512MB), radio (not a high priority), and wearability (is that a word?).Right off the bat, the radio is worthless, as everybody has said. Don't buy this product for the integrated radio.  It works okay if the transmitter is right in front of you (like at the gym), but that's about it.Secondly, the way it handles the expansion memory seems wierd to me.1) When it comes time to transfer music over to the player, you have to choose to transfer to the internal memory or external memory, separately. This makes it difficult to build a playlist and just move the whole thing over.2) It has a custom format for the memory. I would like to use my external card reader/writer to move music over and then put the card into the player. Unfortunately, after formatting the card in the Rio, my PC cannot read the card anymore.The arm band was also not well thought through. All it is a velcro strip that you have to wrap into the player holder's belt clip. So when the player is attached to you, it doesn't feel very stable. Nike's PSAs have really well thought through arm bands (not everything else, though).To be honest, I'm not sure I'm going to keep this product. The size and expandability do not disappoint. The sound quality is great. If the above issues were resolved, this would be the perfect MP3 player.

$REVIEW.: I have this monitor side by side with aApple Cinema 23-inch HD Flat-Panel Displayfor the purpose of using it to view more pictures at once withApple Aperture 2.1.1. The high resolution of this monitor is perfect for viewing huge galleries, meanwhile I am using my Cinema Display as my second monitor for a reason: The color on the Samsung display is going to take a great deal of work to get anywhere matching. My point is that even though this monitor is a TN display, having as many pixels as possible will help me greatly with all sorts of work.The controls do give me plenty of options such as multiple default profiles for gamma, brightness & contrast, and some sort of other color correction that makes colors more or less vivid, which is great if you're going to play a game or like to view the internet with bright colors. I was hoping that the color profile that Leopard used automatically and all of the "Magic" settings off would give me a more color accurate image, however I am going to have to change it in software to try to get it to match.As far as brightness goes, it is no match for the Cinema Display HD. I will have to explore the 3 gamma profiles and possibly change them as needed since happily one of the settings made reading text better at the expense of changing colors greatly.And yes I know the faults of comparing this display to one that costs far more, however this display did not disappoint me and has become part of my arsenal. The high resolution will be helpful everywhere: From editing audio withLogic Studio Retailor Ableton 83593 Live 8 - Windows And Mac or video withFinal Cut Studio. I'll be able to see more and use my more expensive monitor to see everything the way I intend.

$REVIEW.: I recently ran into someone who owns one of these. The owner spent the next half hour telling me all the wonderful things this camera can do. The story ends up he is a freelance writer of some great repute and did not have to buy the camera, Nikon loaned it to him to test drive.I freely admit the pictures it takes are stunning. I sure would love to be able to add additional lenses to my camera. But I have to ask myself if the Coolpix 5000 is worth the money.For me, the answer is short and sweet, "No". My purpose in owning a digital camera is to take photos to send over the Internet. I don't care how fast your connection is, no one is going to want to download the huge files this camera generates! Yes, it is the right choice if you want to print you photos, but at what it costs, are you really going to take with you when your family goes to the local theme park and your kids love the "soak zone" or flume rides? No way, I'm not sacrificing a Kilobuck for a happy snap! If my current camera gets trashed, yes, I'll be disappointed, but I can afford to replace it. If I trashed a Coolpix 5000, I'd have a hard time replacing it.Yes, it's a great camera, but ask yourself, why did you decide to go digital? If it's for fun pix, the Coolpix 5000 may not be the ideal choice for you. If you're into digital photos for commercial use, then maybe this is the camera for you.I'm rating this Middle of the Road for its technical excellence at a very hefty price tag.

$review_text.: I got this accessory to use when photographing lichens and mosses. I use a Canon EOS 7D and either a Canon 60-mm EF-S macro lens or a Canon 28-135 mm "macro" lens. Sometimes I add close-up lenses if I can tolerate the loss of depth of field. I've rarely used the Meike in flash mode, as I often don't mount it on the lens. Lichens especially are better photographed with side lighting, so I hand-hold the ring while looking through the viewfinder. I can place the light just outside the frame, where its relatively low output is enough to get reasonable shutter speeds (less than one second) at f/32 and ISO 100, even in dimly-lit environments. I'd like more power, but who wouldn't? The batteries last quite a while (I use rechargeable Li-Ion cells) and the unit is light enough that I don't mind adding it to the field pack. The Meike ring light does the job, and I think it's a good value.

$review_text.: I have been using my S5 since I got it about 1 month ago from Amazon, and I am very impressed with it so far.  I had wanted a camera with plenty of settings that I could manipulate myself without having to pay for a DSLR.  First of all, my budget is limited, and second of all, I am not a professional photographer.  So, for me, it was either spend over $1000 on a pretty good DSLR (and upset my wife), or find a camera that would offer me some control over my photographs with similarities to a DSLR.Needless to say, I saved my marriage and pocketbook some stress by purchasing the S5.  I can shoot in Program, Shutter Priority, Aperture Priority, Sports, Manual and a host of other modes, including Auto, plus, it has a great movie mode as well, so you can use it like you would a camcorder, if that is your preference.  Also, I love the fact that it uses AA batteries.  It is always a plus if you are ever taking photos and you get a low battery warning, all you have to do is pop in a new set, instead of having to recharge your camera.  I have purchased rechargeable batteries for it, and I would highly recommend it, because it eats up AAs if you are doing a lot of shooting.  The other nice thing is that you can purchase adapters to add different filters to get really cool photo effects, and there are also adaptive lenses out there as well.So, if you are looking for a great camera, and you would like to delve into the photography world, but your budget doesn't include DSLRs, then this is a great choice, IMHO.

$review_text.: The camera records good video images, I'm very happy with that.  The controls work fairly well, though the menus take some getting used to.  I like the two handed operation, thought it's easy for the right thumb to accidentally punch buttons that turn off the auto-focus...  The still images are very grainy, but I don't use this camera for that very often.That's the good, here's the ugly: I got this camera to download digital video into my PC through the onboard 1394 connection.  It simply doesn't work.  I called Sharp tech support: "We can't guarantee that the 1394 interface will work with any other devices except another Sharp camera."  Then why the h-e-doubletoothpicks doesn't the manual say that?  Why does their advertising trumpet the ability to download video to the computer?  Smacks of false advertising to me.***Reviewer's Update***While my annoyance at the attitude of Sharp's customer support is unabated, I must sheepishly admit that the camera wasn't the problem with transferring video to the computer, I was.  I had incorrectly connected the 1394 ports when I assembled my PC.  Once I fixed that, video transfer worked excellently.If it was possible for me to change my rating, I'd now give it 4 stars.  My thumb still pushes buttons I don't want it to push on occasion, button placement is not ideal.

$REVIEW.: I love behind the neck headphones! For me, the ones that go over the top of your head get very uncomfortable, the top of my head always gets sore even if they are cushioned. I also need the ear parts to be flat or they hurt me, too - an awful lot of headphones have tiny circular cushion earpieces that don't cover my ear entirely so it gets painful quickly. These can start to hurt as well but it takes 3+ hours to become an issue - I hardly ever use them for that long at a time anyway. Even then it's not bad - very tolerable.As for earbud headphones - I've tried just about every shape, size and brand of them and can't find ones that start to hurt and/or fall out after just a few minutes. I must have mutant ears!Personally I think the sound quality is great. If you are an audiophile I'm sure they aren't the top of the line but I think they're wonderful. I use them for many things - primarily listening on my laptop or desktop computer, but once in a while on my iPod, cell phone or the TV when people are sleeping and I don't want to make noise.I had a pair of these (not this exact model of course) that I acquired about 5 years ago, but they had stopped working on one side recently. I was pretty sad since I loved the headphones so much - glad to have found they're still making them!The cord is another thing I really love about these - with the cloth covering it just looks and feels so much nicer and secure.

$review_text.: Right out of the box both wireless speakers feels like solid quality hardware. Its' beautiful black design compliments any room. They're not light speakers that you'll want to move around a house (though you can), so finding a place of their own is ideal. We placed ours on a shelf in our living room, and one upstairs in our room. The power cord is not particularly long on the HEOS 3, so you'll need to be sure you have a nearby outlet. Once plugged in the speakers emits a blue bottom backlight that stays on all the time.**Things to know:-- There are only three switches on the speaker: Mute and Volume + and -. They are easy to feel and find in a darkened room.-- You'll need to download the free HEOS by Denon App, which was super easy to find and install both on my iPhone 4 and iPad and took just about a minute to do.-- Launch the app and follow the instructions, which include using the included cord to connect your phone and speaker to complete setup.-- Next it will ask for your wireless password (speaker will glow red if the password or connection is not correct), then you'll name your speaker. There are several preselected names provided: Bathroom, Bedroom, Deck, Den, Foyer, etc., but you can also personalize the name. We names ours "Downstairs" and "Upstairs."-- After you get a connection you will get multiple music choices for supplying music to your HOES speakers: Rhapsody, Pandora, Spotify, etc. I selected "This iPhone" and got my whole list including playlists. Audiobooks were not included (could get around this by labeling them music in iTunes, but I think this should be an option in the app).-- Had songs playing quickly. The volume was astounding! I've never heard anything that loud and clear in my house before. I turned the sound all the way up and the bass was shaking our house. You can do simple adjustment to the speaker to equalize it (through the app), only treble and bass. Thank goodness because I was hearing a lot of bass on music I didn't know had bass. The HEOS 5 speaker sounded clearer and brighter than the HEOS 3.-- BEST FEATURE: you can pair the speakers and play them together. This is the coolest thing ever! You control both speakers and sound through the app. Together they sound amazing. It's so cool to walk around the house and hear the same song playing through out, and not just loose the sound because you went from upstairs to downstairs. Seriously, this is the most amazing feature! Great for parties. Denon says you can pair 32 speakers. Wow. How much would 32 speakers cost, and why would anyone need that many little speakers? But Denon wants to make sure you're covered.-- The cool factor is that so long as you have a WiFi connection you can select music to play on any or both speakers from anywhere near your house.-- Oh, after playing one song and turning it off, when I turned the app back on it asked for an update. I had to wait about 3 minutes or so. Don't know why they didn't just include the update with the initial application download.Overall these are fantastic speakers. They packs a punch for their size (even just one speaker alone!), which is why we were able to label a speaker "Downstairs" and "upstairs," because that's all we need for our townhouse. The speaker is so loud it fills the entire downstairs very clearly on only 1/3 volume setting. If I turn the volume up I'd become the annoying neighbor whose house will vibrate and pop.**What I did not like:-- Unfortunately it only offers sound for movies on your iPhone or iPad when you plug it in with the audio connector. It's not bluetooth. But the speaker and iPad cords are too short and not in a position to place both side by side to watch clearly. So for us we'd have to move the speaker.-- Also, if your router stops working, so will your speakers.-- Interestingly, when you select a song to play the app creates a queue. So say you go to an album and select a song, and the song ends, it goes onto songs you've previously selected, instead of cycling through the songs in the album. This must be a quirk, right? Why can't I listen to all the songs in the album. You do need to create a HEOS account, but I haven't done it yet. I loath creating accounts for something like this, it makes me suspicious that my music habits are being tracked. HEOS says that an "account is required to enjoy online music, playlists, and some other features on your system. Your HOES account is used to interact with the Denon proxy server to manage multiple online accounts, enhance response times, save playlists, and save history data. Your email is required to create an account."Really loving these speakers, but would have loved it more if I could channel movies through it directly, didn't have to create an account, and it played music through an entire album and not just in a queue. I will add another update when we get a chance to set this up for the TV Audio.NOTE: If you're having trouble "grouping" your spears together make sure both have been updated in the app. I had the HEOS 3 updated, but not the HOES 5 and it wouldn't "group." I went online to find a solution but Denon didn't have that under their "Support" section. It was kind of frustrating at first. I even rebooted my phone. Anyway, once you do the update on *both* speakers it should work.

$review_text.: Very small in size, ideal for someone who wants something very lightweight and portable. With an easy connection and a USB plug and socket you can play videos from your USB stick or internal memory. I was satisfied with the picture- has 40 lumens, is pretty good as far as that in concerned. Also has a nice look to it. I did notice the high contrast. I also enjoyed the built in MP4 player and the carrying case was nice. Simple and easy to use as well.If you're looking for a projector that's near as small as possible i'd go with this one, if you're looking for a Philips projector with a little more contrast/ sharper picture yet a tad bigger i'd go slightly larger. Either way you won't be disappointed.

$review_text.: I wanted to add USB ports to my computer and had two free USB headers on my motherboard so this fit my need perfectly.I selected this one over many of the others because I wanted to maximize the number of USB ports I would get without needed to add a hub.  Most of the other adapters only provided 2 ports even when they take up 2 headers.I would probably not recommend it if you one have one available header as you may always be tempted to plug into non-functional USB ports.

It is very comfortable with a resolution of 2560 x 1440. However, the Acer 27&#34; monitor at 1920 x 1080 is not so great at a foot away. Fortunately I bought this monitor to be used with my laptop so it's a bit farther away. With the price though I can't really complain.

$review_text.: I bought the Canon SD870IS camera last year, and was thinking about changing it for a waterproof camera (like the Olympus Stylus 1030SW) to take pictures at the beach or around the pool
 However, I love the SD870, so instead I opted to buy the housing to make it "vacation proof"

 I'm glad I did!  The housing works perfectly, fit and finish are superb, and I have access to all camera functions and buttons
 Plus, it's good enough to take scuba diving, which I probably couldn't do with a regular waterproof camera
 The housing is a little pricey, and if you add the camera you probably end up paying more than you would jave paid for a regular waterproof camera
 But you get to keep Canon's excellent image quality to make up for it.

$review_text.: I've bought one for my Pentax DSLR cameras. I gave it four stars because it is good deal for the under $100, otherwise technically it is about three stars. I would never pay for such a flash more than $120.  I'm spoiled by a good Sony/Minolta flash, yes, those are the best flash technology on the market.Pros:- tilt, rotate and zoom head- Built-in Wide Angle Diffuser Panel- lowest price solution for PentaxCons:- old fashioned switch, small and absolutely uncomfortable. I don't expect such an unexpensive product to have LCD, but instead of that clunky switch they could do four separate buttons and corresponding LEDs, so this way the flash would be good enough for quick switching and professional use.- when you tilt the head up, the flash doesn't auto switch to full power, instead of this you have to operate that stupid little switch, which takes time and is easy to miss the required position/mode.- no strobing mode, so it is useless for serial shooting- it didn't deliver correct amount of light in some conditons, so I had to use exposure bias +/- 1...3 to have my shots properly exposed. I didn't have enough time to work out more details on it. The only thing I can say now, my Minolta HS3600  which I bought of **** used and under $100  was always delivering and I didn't ever see such a problem.Conclusion: if you need an unexpensive flash for Pentax for non-professional use - get it, but I wouldn't pay more than $120 for such a flash.

$review_text.: I've been messing with various mounts in my car for years and only recently became aware of these CD player slot mounts. I have another that occasionally slips out of the slot, so I wasn't too convinced this was the right solution. Right spot, however - it's right where you can reach the device easily. The Exomount has worked out much better, and this is due to the adjustable nature of the mount. The other one I have simply has a flip-type tab. Open the tab, slip it into the slot, and close the tab. This Exomount uses a wingnut type of screw tightener that allows for varying sizes of CD slots. It can be made as tight as you want.I found with this mount that in my Civic, the mount installed &#34;correctly&#34; (wingnut facing down) that it made some of the AC and stereo controls difficult to access. So I flipped it over (wingnut facing up) and it works much better, if maybe it's a little less visually appealing.Best of all it hasn't slipped out once. I can easily remove it to listen to CDs and install it quickly again to have my iPhone where I want it.

$REVIEW.: 6-15-12. I wanted a D3200 in RED but they are unavailable still, so I opted for the black. Only difference is case color. I've been too busy to really learn how to use the tools well, as photography is a hobby for me, not a profession. The D3200 has a lot of features and my first DSLR.  It's physically smaller and lighter than I had expected and that is a nice feature. I bought an optional hand strap attachment (Opteka Professional Wrist Grip Strap for Digital & Film SLR Cameras) that helps me, as I have large hands. The D3200 kit comes with a 18-55MM VR DX lens but no lens hood, so I elected to buy the Nikon HB-45 Replacement Lens Hood for 18-55mm VR Lens. Good choice. The hood fits perfectly and doesn't block flash.  The optional AC power supply and adapter cord set is not currently available (Nikon EH-5A AC Adapter and Nikon EP-5a Power Supply Connector for EH-5a AC Adapter) in the US at this time.I'll update after I use my new "toys".

$review_text.: .Good listening on these earbuds. About exactly like myJBuds J3M's which sell for $15 on a good day. I'm not a sound geek, but I listened to the same tunes many times over with each set.Cord noise is an issue if you're not sitting still. Cord-bumping telegraphs to the earbuds and also the microphone -- more than with the JBuds J3M.Apparently the "for all Kindle Fire Models" version is the same as the vanilla model. (See Note 1.)Here's what I noticed:- - - Advantage Moshi Mythro - - -* 2-year warranty vs 1-year JBuds. (See note 2)- The right bud is red. You don't need a microscope to find Left/Right buds.- - - Advantage JBuds J3M - - -- Cord noise to ear buds. When exercising or moving around...The Mythros pipe significantly more cord-bump noise into your ears than the J3M's.- Cord noise to mic. In my test, the listener on the other end of the call heard some distracting cord bumps with the Mythro, but not with the JBuds.- Microphone sound quality. During a phone call, the listener on the other end said voice quality was good with both...the JBuds probably a little better. The JBuds microphone is about 4" from your mouth vs. 9" for Mythro. I did not yet do a test with background noise.- Mythro cord is more limp and tangle-prone. And harder to untangle.- J3M's come with 4 earcap sizes vs 3Toss-up:- Sound quality seems equally good for both.- - - Notes - - -Note 1: "for all Kindle Fire Models" - There is nothing in the amazon listing to explain why this is different from the regular model. My order for a "Kindle Fire" version was filled with a universal model...no mention of Kindle anywhere. In fact the owner manual says for the control button: "Certain functions supported by Apple iOS devices only."Note 2: Warranty - 2 years is nice, since a lot of my earbuds seem to lose one side after 12-18 months. However JLab will sometimes cover you after the 12 months if you ask.~~~ Comments & questions welcome ~~~

$REVIEW.: The first one froze up the first time we tried to use it. Basically you could not shut it off. There is a little reset button you can trigger with a pin, but the problem continues to happen and that is not a practical solution. So I sent it back thinking maybe it was just a fluke. I also did some research. I was sure that if I applied the latest firmware (1.06) that would fix the issue. The second one already came with version 1.06 but immediately locked up all the same. I'm not going 0 for 3 - it's embarrassing enough that I went through this twice even after reading other reviews. I just really like the camera and wanted it to work. Now I'm looking at alternatives. Amazon has a great return policy so it is not such a big deal, just annoying.

I use this on my flash all the time now


It defuses the light

I even use this on the flash when i use it as an off camera flash shooting through an umbrella
spreads out the light more and makes it extremely soft
If you want the flash a little harder shooting through the umbrella just take it off.Pros:Easy to put on and take offaffordablesoftens the light and spreads it outCons:NONE

$review_text.: It is all you have come to expect from Bose, those speakers you keep passing in the store, trying to justify spending the money on them. I have owned both versions, and this version is superior in sound quality. Our local gym hardly ever has anyone playing basketball in it, so we like to take the family over. This little speaker easily syncs to your ipad via blue tooth and cranks up loud enough to reasonably fill the gym with music while we are shooting hoops. It is well built and small enough to carry anywhere.It says that the battery will last 3-8 hours. We played at the gym for almost 3 hours with the volume turned all the way up and there was still battery power left by the time we were done. Compared to other lower cost portable speakers, I prefer that this has no dock (though you can connect through a stereo cord) has a simple elegant design (that makes Apple products so famous) and superior, crystal clear sound. It won't disappoint.

$review_text.: WHY THIS MODEL:I bought this TV through Amazon last week and it arrived a few days ago. I've had a good amount of time to play with all its capabilities. The out of the box settings are not that good, so the settings do need some adjustment. This TV is an unbelievable deal coming from SONY as it has the EXACT same specifications as the more expensive HX820. The only difference is that the HX820 has monolithic gorilla glass design. I've compared this TV with both the EX720 and the HX820 and this TV delivers a picture almost identical to the HX820 for a much cheaper price than the HX820. The original listing price for the 46HX820 is $2,600 while my 46HX729 was originally listed for $1,900. Trust me, $700 more just for just the monolithic gorilla glass on the HX729 is not worth it. Don't by into the opti-contrast gimmick that Sony says monolithic gorilla glass provides, the HX729 creates black as black as the black frame. I was originally looking to buy the EX720, but after finding out that the panel frequency on that model is actually only 120hz, I settled on this model which is the cheapest SONY 3D TV with 240hz panel frequency. (The EX720 is motion-flow 240, however its actually frequency is only 120hz.) Specification wise, this TV is much better than the EX720 in multiple categories such that the Hz is twice as fast, it has X-reality PRO*(2 processing chips instead of 1), dynamic LED, local dimming, etc. It also the cheapest model to have wifi and the 3d transmitter built it. Surprisingly, it has a glossy display. I thought that this display was the same as the EX720 which is semi-matte but this TV definitely looks more glossy than semi-matte (That's a plus to me because matte can distort the sharpness a little bit)  As far as LCD TV's I couldn't find any other LCD with 240hz panel frequency for this price that looked this good. I would say that this is the best quality/price ratio you will find.2D PICTURE:The 2d non-HD picture is actually pretty good on this TV. The problem with buying decently sized HD televisions is that they seem to stretch out and distort an SD(standard definition) signal. Surprisingly, the X-Reality Pro engine does a nice job tuning up an SD input. Of course, it doesn't make the picture look HD but makes it look better than many other HD TVs will make the SD picture look. As far as HD picture, my girlfriend and I cannot stop saying how incredible and real the picture looks. So far, I have tested BBC's Life series on here in 1080p and he scenes look unbelievably crystal clear with the most vivid colors on a TV I have ever seen. It literally gives a 3D effect without 3D. It looks so clear that it seems like we are actually there watching something through our binoculars. There is absolutely no ghosting effect or distortion whatsoever. The only bad thing I can say is that the picture is so clear that you can sometimes tell when the filmer did not have the camera completely in focus. As far as the motion flow 480, I watched one of the NBA finals game last night and there is no jitter, it is completely smooth. The only downside to using 480 Motionflow is that the back-light is dimmed. I find using the 240hz panel frequency know as the "clear" setting as opposed to "clear pro" setting is the best. I also was able to test out streaming HD content through Netflix. Although the picture was not as good as it was through the blu-ray player it was still pretty clear. But trust me, content through the blu-ray player doesn't even look like you're looking at a TV. The last thing I really like about this TV is how many settings there are for the picture, there must be at least 50 different settings categorized into about 15 groups. As far as the things I don't like(but don't really care about), is that I notice a very tiny amount of light on the bottom corners of the screen when the screen is black. When I say tiny amount I mean about a cm^2 of noticeably brighter back-light. It's no big deal though as when watching Life I only saw it every 2 hours or so for a split second. The other thing I didn't don't like is that the back light is a litter bit dim without adjustment. I turned up the white levels and turned on some setting when I got it and it looks fine now.3D PICTURE:After ordering a defective pair of glasses and replacing them, I finally got a chance to test out the 3d. Even the simulated 3d is amazing. The simulated (2d to 3d conversion) doesn't pop out at you dramatically, but it adds so much depth to the picture. It looks as if you where looking into a window and watching what was going on inside. The real 3d content is identical to the experience you would have in a theater. The 480hz motion flow and the panel frequency of 240hz makes the 3d nearly flawless. Very rarely you will see a double image but that can be fixed by turning down the glasses brightness setting.GAMING:I used to play video games a lot when I was younger but slowly stopped playing as I got older. Nonetheless, when I got this TV i decided to whip out the xbox. Ever since, I've been playing a few hours a week. This TV is amazing for gaming. It has a game mode that you can put it on, by doing so you can select if you want quality or speed. The speed setting greatly reduces input lag to a point where it seems like there is none. The quality setting helps with motion blur.Content:This TV is loaded with content. Amazon and Netflix have content in HD. The only downside is that this TV does not have VUDU. However, you can always buy a blu-ray player that comes with Vudu.Design:I was having second thoughts after I had ordered this 46 inch TV. I was honestly thinking 46 inches would be too small. However, I found out that a 46 inch TV looks remarkably smaller in a store than it will in your home. While unpacking this TV I thought they had sent me the 55inch TV by accident. This 46inch TV in you're home will look like a 55inch TV looks in a store. Unless you're watching your TV from 20 feet away, you really don't need a 55 inch TV. A 55 inch TV will look tacky and overpowering if you don't have the room. I also really like the thinness and small frame size, it's very compact. The screen finish is very nice as well. When I had ordered this TV I was having second thought about getting a semi-matte or matte screen since it can distort the sharpness of the picture. However, this TV didn't turn out to be matte or semi-matte at all. Maybe I don't know what semi-matte is, but I can definitely see clear undistorted reflections of my room and myself when the TV is off. This TV just looks expensive.Sound:The sound is not the best. It's not bad but it's just average. You can hear everything very clearly with no distortion, however, it won't provide the sound dimensions that external speakers will.Overall:As I stated, this TV is the best quality/price LCD you will probably find. It is the cheapest Sony TV that provides the panel frequency of 240Hz and X-Reality Pro engine that the flagship HX929 provides. It is also the exact same spec-wise as the HX820 but for a price closer to the lower end models; NX, EX, etc. Disregarding the great specifications, this TV will bring an amazingly real picture to your living room.

This product blew me away when I started to open it and put it in my Macbook. The color is near flawless. It is almost identical to the color of my laptop. The battery fit in with no struggle or extra encouragement.For 1/4th of the price from buying directly from Apple and a 1 year warranty, you cannot beat this product.Update: 7/25/12 - Just received an email from Techorbits customer support making sure my product was working good for me and if I had any questions to contact them.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this power supply for my Asus eee 1000HE after the original power brick burnt out.  The tip did not fit into the power port on the 1000HE well (it was too long), but since it did power the netbook I decided to keep it.  Three weeks later the tip began to wobble a little when it was plugged into the netbook.  Last week it just stopped working at all.  It seems that the connection inside the tip came loose.  If the quality of something I am able to observe is so poor, I don't want to think about the quality of the internal workings of this power supply, given the instances of other non-name brand aftermarket power supplies melting or otherwise overhearing.I am returning this for a refund and ordering an OEM model from the Asus store.  It is a lot more expensive up front, but for the quality and reduced risk for a fire, it is worth it.

$review_text.: The home theater I had originally was a $150 Philips HTS3544 "Home Theater In a Box" System. The Philips at the time was what I needed: it had good sound quality, it produced strong bass that shook the house at mid-volume, and was an inexpensive system to complement my TV set. Recently, I picked up a new 55" Panasonic 3D HDTV and so I needed a replacement home theater that has 3D play-back and additional HDMI connections for my other electronics. Old unit only had an HDMI OUT; no HDMI IN. So after a week of research and reading reviews, I decided to upgrade to the Samsung HT-E6500W. I purchased this for the following facts: 1) it was a complete system, 2) it has the latest technologies that other HTIBs haven't yet incorporated, and 3) it was going to make my movies and TV viewing come to life around me. It is nice that it has premium apps (Netflix, Pandora, HULU Plus, etc) and other useful apps (Korean music videos; Asian movies and shows; and apps for news and weather).Out of the box, it was easy to physically set up. Everything was wrapped up in protective wrap so peeling off the wrap felt like an early Christmas present. Also I already have corner platforms I set up for the rear speakers and nails on the wall for the front speakers from my original HTIB so the mounting of this system was super easy.As soon as I ran the unit through the initial step-by-step setup (with easy audio calibration), I was able to tell immediately the difference in sound quality on TV/cable programming and my blu-ray movies. I don't really have the ear to listen to sound frequency as audiophiles do, but I will say that the sound produced is not hollow or muffed and has an adequate amount of tone depth.However after testing it out on my blu-ray copy of Avatar, I did not get adequate dialog volume out of the center speaker and bass from the subwoofer. I realized that the audio calibration was merely to tune the volume out of each speaker. I found audio settings for audio frequency and individual speaker "db" volume (for re-tuning the settings from the calibration). I messed around with these settings for a couple of hours, and I couldn't figure out how to increase dialog and bass. Then I realized, all of my fine tuning was done with the volume set on low. Duh! After making further adjustments with the volume up, I was able to realize the louder dialog and added bass that I longed for. I think I got it to what I want out of it.In conclusion, I'm happy that this HTIB does what it was meant to do and it does it's job well. The surround sound is loud & clear from all angles, the bass is good (not great, but good), and the system looks really nice visually without visible cords running to the back of the room. Only time will tell as to how long this HTIB will last me before it dies, but initially, I'm a happy camper.-------------------------------1/9/2013 -- Edit --I have had a little bit more time to play blu-ray movies through this HTIB and it doesn't look like there's a simple way to fix the low dialog db on some blu-ray movies out of the center speaker. It happens in Avatar and recently happened with Resident Evil: Retribution. In my other blu-ray movies, I don't notice it so the problem could be a result of a certain frequency or signal that the player isn't sending. I know it isn't my setup because I checked and my HDMI connections are tight and I ensured the cords aren't damaged. As much as want to keep this at my 5-star rating, this problem annoys me enough that I am dropping my rating down to 4-stars. If I figure out what causing it and get it fixed, I'll update my review.-------------------------------2/4/2013 -- Edit --I feel it necessary to make another update to my review because I felt my initial review was a case of the blind leading the blind. I didn't know audio equipment needed burn-in to sound it's best. Over the course of 2 months of my ownership and well over 100 hours of playtime, I am happy to report that the sound has become progressively much more full-sounding. The biggest improvement was the bass produced from the subwoofer; the bass it produces has become stronger and deeper. Now bass rumbles and thumps quite powerfully and can be heard and felt upstairs on a healthy volume setting (and to think I researched for days looking for ways to replace/upgrade the subwoofer!). I no longer need to keep the subwoofer volume pegged at [+6 dB]. Equally, I no longer notice the reduction in dialog dB from before. It seems that the middle speaker (the most important speaker for dialog frequencies) needed time to burn-in for it to sound right.However, playing music through the system is good but not good enough to show off to your audiophile friends. My $100 headphones (un-amplified) have 2X better clarity and an overall better sound quality. Of course, it doesn't play movies or comes close to the level of sophistication as this Samsung home theater but the sound quality is something that can be improved on future versions. This is what's holding me back from changing the product's 4 stars to 5 stars. Don't get me wrong, it's not as bad as it may sound. I'm still very happy with it and use it to try to convince friends to get a HTS.Before I forget, I want to add that many exclusive apps that come with this HTIB are worthless as many requires you to pay $6 to stream an HD movie or an on demand video (I use netflix and I don't mind running out to Redbox for a $1.50 blu-ray). However, an app that I have been spending tremendous time with is "REDUX". It pulls content from Youtube but you get nice HD quality videos (with a wired connection and decent MB/second broadband connection) and you can skip vids whenever you want. All of it comes WITHOUT any advertisements! I highly recommend the Chicago Tribune channel but I also check out the Caught on Tape channel. There's so much content that you'll never want to watch television programming again.-------------------------------4/29/2013 -- Edit --I purchased a pair of Dayton B652 speakers for my karaoke system and one day had an idea to use it in place of my FL & FR HTIB speakers. Connecting the wires was as easy as expected and the sound out of them is better and more powerful. I liked the sound so much I decided I will just keep the Samsung FL & FR speakers for my karaoke system because it is a lot more portable than the Dayton speakers and it works very well for a small-medium sized room. So now I'm debating if I should also upgrade the center & surround speakers too but I don't currently have platforms for heavier/larger speakers if I did.

$review_text.: Bought this for a 2008 MDX with NAV, XM, and XM Traffic.  The device operates through the radio either via the XM or CD Changer (CDC) button.  Despite what this page and the vendor (Pacific Stereo) website say, the manual explicitly says this is not compatible with Acura vehicles with NAV and XM Traffic - in order to use this with NAV and XM Traffic-equipped vehicles, you need to use the CD Changer interface.  Other reviewers say doing so makes your CD changer into a single CD player (I didn't try).Also, when using the XM interface, the XM1 band (presets 1-6) are lost as this devices takes over the buttons (you still get the six XM2 buttons).  Be warned.One more thing - because this is not an officially sanctioned iPhone device, your iPhone will operate in airplane mode, which means you can listen to music but you can't accept calls when using it (or so the phone says when you plug it in - again, I haven't tried it yet).On the up side, Pacific Stereo was kind enough to send me a return label and swap this for the PA15-ACUXL (for $20 more) which is *supposed* to handle newer NAV and XM Traffic enabled vehicles.  I'll update this review in a week or two when I receive it and can try it out.

$REVIEW.: I have used this setup with my home theater system for a month.  I agree with most reviewers it is a solid product. Pros are it is super light and has a decent working range. It does skip numbers from time to time but I am at 12 feet or so.  It does what I bought it for and the price around 30 dollars was a great deal. Another pro is it works perfectly with Windows 7 and many others do not when I was reading about them.  I use it instead of my hot laptop and now see the computer on my flat screen and use an hdmi to the tv from the laptop.  Now I can sit in my tv chair and cruise the internet on my tv and also stream movies etc.  It makes Youtube great as I can now type in my searches easily when using my tv remote it took forever.

$REVIEW.: Last year I purchased a vizio lcd that had the ability to connect to the internet and stream movies. It was extremely slow, the remote broke within a month, and the tv would cut off in the middle of watching it to optimize the settings. I hated it so much I ended up giving it to a friend after about a year. I then purchased this tv, which I have discovered to be a superior product. The tv is very quick and the appear and ability to stream content to it is superb. I absolutely love this tv. It is extremely thin and attractive, superior in every way to the visio. I would definitely recommend the magic remote with this purchase. This tv also has an auto brightness feature that I love. Great purchase.

$review_text.: The 2-way finding functionality of the product is really awesome!  You can click the fob to find your phone, or click the phone app to find your keys.The main drawback for finding your phone, however, is that the Proximo app has to be running in the background
 This works great, right up until the point where you restart your phone, and the app is not running anymore

 Then you can't use the fob to find your phone, until you remember to restart the app.

$review_text.: Ok first, dispite other reviews it does charge and play at the same time. You plug the power in, then the headphone jack. Other then that it works as described. I get a little feedback in my OEM toyota stereo when I am streaming offer the 3G network, but it's a 94 4Runner that I use as an off road rig, not exactly a cutting edge stero system.the feed back is that "beep beep beep beep" that older radios get from cellphones. Also if you are on another radio station that is close to the one you chose you might get some static noise.As LO-TEK as it is, I like the it uses the headphone jack, it allows me to plug in other stuff like a police scanner or my EMS radio and play it over the stero (the red neck I bought the rig from installed a glass pack exhaust and its loud as a lawnmower on meth in there)So in short, stays in the outlet, stays in the bent position you put it in, stays on the channel you tune it to (it does send interference if you are streaming and it does throw some static if you are listening to the radio on another close channel. But it's cheap!

Although this protective lens is expensive, it will make replacement on a bumped cracked lens a lot easier on the wallet than replacing an entire lens.

$review_text.: It's exactly a netbook, but with a proprietary Google OS. However, it's very light, and the 6.5 hours of battery life is very easy to attain. 2/3 screen brightness and average web browsing will easily get you there (this does not include youtube videos or flash games, which eat battery for breakfast lunch and dinner). If you're very careful, offline, etc, you should hit 9 hours or a bit more. But, really, who types for 9 hours?If you're looking for a desktop replacement, this IS NOT it. If you're looking for a secondary computer for general web use while out and about, this beats the ipad (and tables in general) hands down (in my opinion) because it's much, much more capable. An iPad with a keyboard (my last mobile solution, and it was a nice keyboard) was no match for this Chromebook.Looking for a downside? The screen, while nice enough, uses a very matte surface to reduce glare, which causes it to look a bit dull, and slightly dirty. Otherwise, the obvious downside of it being essentially a browser is apparent. However, for typing, Google Docs now works offline (obviously syncing when you're back online).Overall, I love this device, and at $249, it's a bargain.

$REVIEW.: I recently built a new entertainment center and decided to hide all of the wiring in wall


 I needed a long RCA cable to go from the closet to an RCA wall plate (for a subwoofer) and settled on this cable due to the price


 I am honestly surprised by the quality of this cable


 It is a very thick cable and has plenty of shielding
 I snaked it through the walls and around a few very tight corners and have not had a problem so far

 I ran it alongside my speaker wire and the quality of sound coming from the sub is just as good as with the *high quality* (read: expensive!) six foot cable I was using previously
 For the price this cable cannot be beat
 I highly recommend this product over the $70 or more cables at your local big box store.

$REVIEW.: This Anker hub has a one-piece aluminum alloy shell that looks like the flap from an airplane wing. This gives it a clean look and quality feel that coordinates well not only with my Mac mini but also with my Samsung Chromebook and Acer notebook. It has a solid feel and a weight of almost 10 oz. plus four rubbery feet underneath, so it stays put. There is a choice of black or white plastic end caps and rear panel.There are seven USB 3.0 data and power ports and they have a tight fit so the connectors don't fall out. As long as this hub is linked to a USB 3.0 port on the computer by the included SuperSpeed USB 3.0 A to B cable, it can support data transfers up to 5 Gbps. In practice, this means that the USB connections in this hub aren't going to be the bottleneck during data transfers and speed will depend on the connections in the computer or peripherals.There are labeled blue LED indicators for power and port activity. It comes with a two-part power cable with in-line converter that plugs in next to the power button on back.The hub supports all my devices, including Kindle Paperwhite, Seagate hard drives, Patriot hard drives, wired mice and keyboards, various speakers, printers, thumb drives, headsets, and a hard drive dock. The instructions say some wireless receivers for mice and keyboards may not function but my Logitech receivers work just fine. It supports hot-swapping of peripherals including hard drives.This Anker hub will even recharge my Kindle Paperwhite, iPod Shuffle, portable speakers, and electric shavers. Although it is not intended to be used as a charging hub, it supplies a full 6 A of power and has surge protection.The instruction manual is easy to read and contains all needed information about use, specifications, customer service, and the eighteen month warranty. The frustration-free and recyclable packaging is also a nice touch.A sample was provided for testing and unbiased review.

$review_text.: I am extremely unhappy with this product


I got it several days late, but that was not the stores fault, that was a problem with the local post office

It was packaged ok, considering it is basically a toy


It is nice that the tripod comes with a case to carry it in but it does not fit my camera that is the same size as the one shown

The arm that you twist to tighten so the arm does not move comes pre-stripped and does not tighten the tripod at all, it just keeps turning
Because of this it is totally useless to hold a camera on the end of the tripod arm as it shows in the pictures
I have 2 cameras that I wanted to use it with and the tripod arm will not even hold the smallest one on the end of the arm, and the camera, as I have said, is a lot smaller than the one shown


I do not even trust it to hold my main camera on the top of the tripod and it is the same size as the one shown


The "normal price" of around $30 that they advertise is a total joke


I wouldnt pay anything over the price that I paid (around $12 including tax)and even though this is a great idea in theory, but I would not suggest this to anybody that will be using it other than as a toy.

No need to splice wires or anything such.I was able to mount the antenna ontop the unit right next to the GPS and there's no interferrance whatsoever.As for flashing, running windows7 64bit and had no trouble getting the firmware to run and do its thing.Quality wise - what can I say ?  This is going to be tucked away from site so who cares what it looks like?  I made sure to electrical tape all the connectors to give it added grip.  I placed the system box and receive in the footwell of the vehicle and have the antenna ontop the receive unit.  Cords are plenty long enough for this.Yes, this would've been very nice if it were integrated with the receiver unit.  But get over it - it's not, and you can only make do with what you got. In this case, the XM now has the appearance of being fully integrated and I'm quite happy with it.Edit:  Unit has been working great for almost a year.  I love this thing.  No problems whatsoever with XM.  Appears those who have had trouble with the unit either got a bad one or wouldn't be able to put together a two piece jigsaw puzzle.

$REVIEW.: The detail when you look into the lens of this camera is very realistic. The light blinks as it should and can be seen both day and night. It comes with a fake power cord that you can position to look as if it is running into the wall which makes it more convincing. It is of plastic construction but it is silver with realistic camera markings/branding printed on it. Complete with screws, it was easy to mount but care must be taken to snug the screws as you are dealing with plastic here and not metal. The top slides off for easy battery replacement and it has survived blowing rain, wind and freezing sleet. I change the batteries every 6-7 weeks or when they start to dim. I use it in conjunction with warning decals on my windows and doors as well as IR and motion switched outside lighting.

I did a fair amount of research via the internet, and the Sony seemed solid.  I use the headphones almost exclusively with my iPod Nano -- easy and efficient.  The cushioning over the ears is comfortable and never heavy except after hours of wearing.  The cord is extremely long and I often have to throw it over my back when wandering around the house -- they're made for more professional use, I suppose.

It adds a bit of bulk to the power block and cord, but not enough to be a problem. Of course, I won't know how good it is as a surge protector until/unless it experiences a power surge. I understand that APC is a major brand of power-related equipment for electronics, and that influenced my decision to buy this one.

$review_text.: Just bought the item, had it about 4 days. It sounds much better when plugged into some external speakers I bought for my iPad, but I could only hear sound from the left channel. So I plugged my headphones in and could only hear the left channel. Both speakers and headphones work fine with my iPad. I just got off the hotline with Sony telephone support. They confirmed to me that the unit is monoaural and only outputs through the left channel, not the right channel. So if you're planning on sometimes listening through headphones or speakers, give this unit a miss.

$review_text.: My latest display electronics have been Samsung - 24" wide screen monitor (using right now) and 52" LCD TV. I knew what I was looking for and getting with this item - I work in computers and had done my research. This frame met my expectations - the price was decent for the resolution, sleek look, good size, and pretty easy to use. The controls are on the front panel, but stay hidden until activated. Uploading images was a snap, though you're always better off manually cropping/fixing your own images - the frames can do it, but you'll save space and not end up with extra background or skewed photos if you do it yourself. There are programs out there to optimize images in batches.1 GB was a lot of storage (especially after my optimization). I tested this item as a mini-monitor for fun (my dad won't use it for this). and it was so-so. I think the refresh capabilities are lacking in this arena. I was easy to hook up and use as such, but any 'activity' on the mini-screen was somewhat sluggish. Overall good product, good price!

$review_text.: Giving it 4 stars since they made their flagship remote without RF.  Other than that, the remote has a programmable interface through software on the PC/Mac that is second to none.  I can control my fly-by-night TV, a playstation3 (using blu wave usb), two receivers, two TVs, and a DVD.  Even the wife can operate it, which speaks volumes.  She scares me.If you don't need RF, this is the remote to buy.  If you need RF, the harmony 890 is probably your best alternative, same features, slightly different display.

$REVIEW.: At first when you try this device, you might be frustrated and thinking it's broken because the dial won't turn. Well, it turns alright; you just have to push the little piece of plastic in first! It's some sort of interlock to make sure that the selection is locked in exactly, because if the internal parts don't align to a high precision, your optical signal will not go through and you will have no audio. Since the signal is digital, a less than perfect connection will not degrade the quality of the audio; either there will be enough SNR that the digitization works, or it will chop out or stop working entirely; there's not much in-between.This is an extremely simple device. The ports seem to fit my AmazonBasics TOSLINK cables just fine, and I wasn't able to experience any looseness in the connection like some people mentioned in their reviews. The internal 3-way switch that connects to each port seems to be basically sound.In short, the device looks cheap, it feels cheap, but in the end I was able to get it to work, and it does what it says it'll do. I even tried switching between different inputs while both inputs were playing sound, and I didn't hear any kind of distortion or crackling or pops -- just a clean switch between one stream and the other. I use it to switch between my TV and computer, and connect the output to my SteelSeries H Wireless base station for wireless listening.I am not in love with this device; it is just one more gadget I have on my desk that fits its purpose without being glamorous or even very ergonomically friendly. It's also much larger than you might expect from the picture. But you know what? I didn't expect much out of this device, and it performs THE primary (only!) function it is designed to perform, without, what I can detect, any serious flaws. So how can I not give it 5/5 stars?

$review_text.: I will review the entire camera although i purchased this lens separately. I have several digital cameras including a fine SLR with 2 excellent autofocus zoom lenses but when i began taking pictures with the GF1, I was amazed at the results. The IA setting adjusts to shadows and  other lighting situations in a manner that in inexplicable and simply amazing. In addition, this lens has excellent light gathering ability and can take pictures in low light situations without a flash assuming one does attend to the available lighting on the subject to some degree. My friends are amazed at the compactness of the camera with this lens and the features not to mention the amazing detail in the resulting pictures. This camera can also take movies and the quality is really good. When taking movies, one must be careful to move the camera slowly so as not to blur and confuse the video an all cases. This is something to become accustomed to with video as opposed to still photography. I was able to purchase this camera for a reduced price and it is not cheep but is well worth the cost, and from what i have read, the 20 mm lens is the one to buy. it is not zoom but the camera can magnify the pictures 2x or 4x digitally, and the camera has the pixels to handle this with good results. I also adapt the camera to use my older olympus OM and E lenses with excellent results.

$review_text.: Granted I didn't use the flimsy suction cups but drilled and attached this directly to a fence post

This, as well as a low-loss cable I had to buy from another site (note to all, Amazon does NOT sell a wire that will go from the back of a standard WiFi router, aka LinkSys, Netgear, et
al.), got the WiFi signal out of the house to a fencepost where I now am shooting 90% signal strength well over 100 yards where before I had 0%

In fact it's shooting that signal through a giant old house between my house and the structure I'm sending the signal to
It's fairly incredible for such a simple set up
The signal even is stronger in the house in general as an added bonus
If you're looking to shoot your WiFi signal over 100 yards to another building with this, and a third-party male to female low-loss wire, you'll be all set and in business.

$REVIEW.: These are pretty cheap.  The quality is lower echelon.  You'll pay more at Radio Shack, BUT get a better quality item if you get the gold plated looking one.  These will do the job but I THINK they will contribute to degrading your signal if you're joining two high quality co-ax cables with one, thereby perhaps wasting your money on higher quality shielded cable which is what I felt I had done. Not recommended unless you just want a VERY basic set-up, say you're just setting up shop on a very low-budget.

$REVIEW.: Purchased these for my Sansa Fuze mp3 player after messing around with half-dozen lesser-quality earbuds and the stock Apple ipod buds over the past three years.These are pretty good. Overall the build quality seems OK but the real test is how well they stand up over time.  The cord seems very thin- I have my doubts.  At first these were falling out of my ears even with the large silicone tips.  Then I realized I had them in backwards.  Now the fit is significantly better.  It's probably true of all in-ear buds but the noise from the cord just gently rubbing on clothes is really annoying.  When the cord is really flopping around during running or workouts I imagine that it would be really problematic.  Also, they do shut out a great deal of environmental noise so probably not that safe to go running with an isolating earbud like this anyway. This style of earbud also accentuates the noise of your breathing and blood circulation- not that great when walking around but not a problem at all when resting.The sound image is quite good and I'm picking up significant detail in music that I was never aware of before.  I find the sound pretty flat- no un-natural boosts or attenuation at any points across the spectrum.  Bass is reasonable and not artificially boosted. Overall, they seem fine.  My perception is that they are a bit expensive for what they are.  However, there's not much available between the plethora of junk at the ten dollar range and the Shure and Sennheiser range at hundreds of dollars.  If I had more time for research and just slightly more money I'd seriously consider some good quality compact headphones like Bose or Sennheisers.  The rubbing noises are a pretty significant drawback for me anyway.UPDATE:2011-03-17Pretty happy with these and have learned to deal with the surface noise.  Still wish there was a slightly larger silicone insert; the largest one still s-l-o-w-l-y works its way out of my ear canal.  Sound is very detailed.  You hear things in the mix you never heard before.
$SUMMARY.: Pretty good so far

If you have your Kindle set in the case the way it is supposed to go(that allows the auto on/offwhen opening the case) then you have to leave it wide open to charge it.  You can set it in there the other way and thenyou only have to open the magnetic latch to charge it, but then the automatic on/off feature will not work because it is set in there the wrong directionfor that.  If the auto on/off feature doesn't matter to you, then this is a nice case that looks good and feels protective.

$review_text.: A switch to those who are unfamiliar to networks is a passive switch that enables signals to pass through unchanged the way a router does. Routers think. Switches simply transmit. It is like a power outlet with 6 connectors for AC. It just takes the same signal that is coming in and spreads it amongst the outlets. A router will sense when a device is booted up, and in a DHCP environment it will assign an IP address to the device. Switches don't do anything like that.So what are the uses? For me in particular, I am remodeling the main bedroom, and in there I am putting a high def TV which has an internet/ethernet connection. I also have a Blu-ray player that has the Net Flix option so connecting to the internet is essential. On top of that I am running Windows Media Center with a Cisco Linksys Media Center Extender which has an ethernet input which enables it to draw video, TV, and audio from the main media center pc. So that is three items that have need of an internet connection. So rather than run 3 separate ethernet cables into the room, you just run one, and then hook that one up to this TP-Link switch, and then you hook all three devices up to the switch. In the living room I have the same setup but with a networked receiver as well. So these come in handy, and for the price it is actually cheaper than buying several cables.There isn't really anything negative to say about this switch. I love the energy efficiency so it is not running full tilt all of the time; I have enough energy drainers running all of the time around the house as it is. Highly recommended.

It bit difficult to move the tv once mounted but hopefully it gets easier over time.I did run into an issue with the installation though. Bracket is about 24&#34; wide so if the stud happens to be on the center of the mount then some alternate solution will be needed if you want to screw all 4 screws of the bracket to the studs. My contracter ended up cutting out the walling and installing few 2x4s to remediate it. But something to keep in mind.Like few others have suggested, spend an extra $1 or $2 and get better hardware for mounting.

$REVIEW.: Does not work for me as an &#34;all in one&#34; solution.As a Bluetooth earpiece, it is too bulky, and rather inconvenient
 The ear buds are not sufficiently magnetized, consequently the cords keeps getting lose and tangled
 It is definitely not easy to store when not in use
 If you are looking for a Bluetooth earpiece to use primarily for phone conversations, this is not the best option
 The sound quality is OK, but not particularly great for voice communication.I will keep it for listening to music, but will definitely get a small dedicated Bluetooth earpiece as well.Pros:Seems solidly builtVery good battery lifeGood voice feedbackWorks with SIRI on iPhone 5

$SUMMARY.: Good for music, but not convenient as a Bluetooth earpiece

$review_text.: For a headphone set under $10, the sound out of these little headphones is quite remarkable and rival any cheap offering from Wal-Mart.  I'd say that these are on par with a $20 set of headpones easily.  Sound isolation is almost completely absent, but I just wanted something that sounded decent and I could fall asleep to without worrying about damaging (hey, if they break, they're cheap to replace!).Sound is pretty well-balanced on all spectrums without being completely WOW in any department.  However, they are not lacking in any department either and thankfully are NOT just simply juiced up thumpers with washed out high- and mid-frequencies.Also, for the price, they are pretty good purchases for youngsters who can't take care of a more decent pair of headphones.  Highly recommended!

$REVIEW.: Very responsive keys, which is critical for me and it feels like I am typing and not just gliding/slipping over the keyboard. I also tried using the keyboard's bluetooth with my ipad, which was a breeze to connect and use.  Also easy connection with the imac.  it takes up a smaller footprint becasue there is no separate area for the numeric keys: okay with me as we are working towards a minimal office space at home.  Durability of the keyboard may be suspect as the body is made of plastic and spray painted silver .. but you really have to look to really notice it.  Otherwise a great addition to the keyboard space.

$REVIEW.: When I ordered the Fire, I bought this case along with the plain Marware shell, and the Amazon zipped sleeve. I like this leather case the best by far. It exactly fits the Fire so it doesn't add much length or width bulk. The material is very solid so it protects the Fire very well, and the elastic strap keeps it closed when in my bag. The stand setup could be a little bit more solid, but it still works very well once you have it setup. This looks to be the best case on the market at this point for the Kindle Fire.

$REVIEW.: I bought the Survivor for my new iPhone 5 because I'm a sailor so my phone gets exposed to rain and spray, and because I have been known to drop things. Although I did not drop test my phone or dunk it in water, examination of the case convinces me it will be good protection.  There were mixed reviews about sound quality -- I can report that sound is fine -  mic, earphone, and speaker phone.  No problem, sounds like without the case. I had no problem using the touchscreen through the case window.  The case is also more comfortable to hold than the bare phone. I like it a lot. This case is, however, a bit bulky: 3/4in thick, 2 7/8 in wide, 5 7/16 in long.  Not huge, but a bit big for me to carry in my pocket or on my belt at work. The belt clip provided is secure, but not easy to use. I bought an incipio case for weekday use, and will use the Griffin on the weekends. It takes about a minute to put the case on.

$review_text.: This are ok headphones. I don't have anything bad to say about them but for this price range I expected better.Pros:1. Bluetooth works flawlessly. It was very easy to set up & connects perfectly every time.2. Built in active noise reduction.3. Moderate priceCons:1. The wires are very thin. They may last but I'm concerned that they'll break quickly.2. The wires are an awkward length. At about 20" long. This makes the device hang to about your waist. It's too short to put in your pocket. The design of the device is a clip that works nicely with a button down shirt but I bought these for working out & mowing the lawn (more on tis later) when I usually wear a tee shirt or sweatshirt. Clipping the device to a tee shirt is uncomfortable. It continually falls off. You can clip it in your collar but it's a little heavy & will chafe your neck or you can clip it to your sleeve but it bounces around when you're running or working out and becomes a real annoyance.3. The noise cancellation is very modest. Do not expect these to perform like the Bose, where you get complete silence on an airplane. I've used these on a plane, mowing the lawn, & on a noisy treadmill. The high frequencies get reduced slightly (there is a noticeable change in the sound) but the effect is subtle. On the plane there was a baby crying a few rows ahead of me & I could hear it loud & clear. My lawnmower & treadmill are the same, a slight reduction in volume but absolutely still audible. Another interesting phenomenon is that if you enable the noise reduction when running outside it produces a lot of very annoying wind noise. Turning the noise reduction off fixed this & I'm not running in particularly noisy places anyway.All said & done, I guess I was expecting Bose quality for 25% of the price. I may return them simply because while having a little noise reduction is better than none,  the cable length is unusable. I would much rather have to keep my phone in my pocket when working out & have headphones that just plug in.

$REVIEW.: I resisted the SSD urge for a couple years, and finally switched. I was holding off until the MTBF rose significantly compared to what it was a while ago. Also, the trend toward affordability made it pretty tantalizing. A trusted friend just installed one and reported amazing performance, so I felt it was high time to jump. The short version amounts to: using the Intel OEM / Acronis migration wizard made this a complete no-brainer migration from an existing Windows 7 installation on magnetic media, to this 180GB SSD. I'm glad I did it, and as a nice bonus, I also get a very recent full-system backup (my old hard drive) as a result.Pros:Drive- and package-specific:* Drive is fast, like really fast. How fast depends on lots of factors, too many to name here, but very importantly it depends on which tool you use to the speed test, and what block size you test with. Using DskSpeed, the linear read speeds using 128KB blocks, typical for most data, topped out at 315MB/sec for linear reads and 279MB/sec for random reads. This is nearly 5x the speed of the drive this replaces, and the performance certainly bears that out.* The drive is very small -- it's a 2.5&#34; form factor appropriate to drop into modern laptops* Intel generously includes a 2.5&#34; to 3.5&#34; drive adapter bracket so it fits neatly into the cage* Intel generously includes mounting hardware (both necessary sizes of screws) and a 6GB/sec SATA III cable* Included is a short instruction sheet that makes it seem too easy, but in reality it *is* that easy* The drive is silent; no moving parts* It's very light; a comparable magnetic drive in the 2.5&#34; form factor weighs in at around 5 oz., while this one tips the scale at less than 80 grams (3 oz)* Power consumption is lower than a magnetic driveWindows pros:* Startup speed (from where the OS starts, not including the BIOS screens) went from around 25 seconds down to 4 seconds* Start-up for most apps is practically instantaneous. For office apps, browser and e-mail, it's in the half-second range where looking away for a moment means you missed it* WEI disk score (for those of you who at least think it is helpful to look at) jumped from the &#34;forever stuck at 5.9&#34; doldrums to 7.9* The Intel optimization software, which one really should run, does an excellent job of quickly adjusting Windows settings to make best use of the drive, and degrade it the least in the long term* The Intel OEM version of Acronis makes migration super-easy*. (See below for why I added the asterisk. It's a strange case, but one that certain users should be aware of.) Acronis worked exactly as I had hoped. It uses a wizard-like interface to talk the migrating user through which drive to clone (e.g. your old, slow one), and where to make the new clone (e.g., your new hyper-fast one). You can go step-by-step using its wizard, and also change things you've already answered by just clicking the history states at the left side of the app. It runs a short Windows portion to gather your info, then reboots, finishes the migration, and that's all for it. It tells you your system will turn off when you hit a key, then it's time to pull your old drive out, make sure the new one is set as the boot drive in the BIOS, and then you're off to the races.Cons:None* (see 'other thoughts' for the specific case that won't affect most users, and thus really shouldn't be considered a con.)Other thoughts:For most users, that's the end of it. This is a super solution for slow drives. It doesn't excuse you from good maintenance practices, registry cleaning, removing unnecessary services and all that if you are a bit of a power user. It tremendously accelerates load times (by my tests, 3x the fastest magnetic drive I own, and about 5x the speed of the one it replaced) and per the MTBF, it should be a long-lived solution.There seems to be only one fly in the ointment for this, and it's not the drive itself. It's the Acronis software. As stated above, this is the perfect solution for most users, and it performed beautifully for me after I resolved an unexpected issue that it could not work around. I won't dock a star for this, since I'm ever so grateful for how superbly easily it went after I manually fixed a holdup. See below for that special case.For me, this was the issue: I had a Linux partition at the end of my boot drive, which I put there using my BIOS. It served as a sanity backup of the system state from 24 months ago. I had not removed it, expecting that I could specify only the Windows partition to Acronis for it to clone. Not so; it wanted to either 1) migrate the entire disk as is, which would chop off a partition partway through, or 2) migrate the entire disk, shrinking partitions proportionally, or 3) let me direct it. So I chose the manual method (#3), hoping that it would let me choose only the Windows partition. It didn't; it instead wanted to migrate both the Windows partition and the Linux, which I didn't want. It provided no way to work around this. Thus I had to exit out of the app, run diskpart, and delete the Linux partition (since disk management cannot do it). If you find yourself in this situation, you must also use the &#34;override&#34; switch to delete the partition, after choosing the disk and choosing the partition. This isn't the place for a tutorial, but I wanted to raise the awareness of certain users who are migrating an existing partition, which is one of at least two partitions on the drive, where at least one of the others is a Linux or other OEM partition.

$REVIEW.: I bought this camera for my daughter for Christmas, as before she used a Kodak Easy Share LS420. Not happy with the shutter lag, and a want-to-be amateur photographer, we picked out the Nikon D40 Digital SLR.The lens speed is fantastic and the colors come out gorgous. She has never gotten so many compliments on the clarity and color of her photos before.The camera is light weight and comes with a heavy strap to carry. You also get a 18-55mm lens that zooms and distances the photos as you desire. It has an auto-focus option where all you have to do is press the button half way and it will focus the photo for you before you take it.On Auto, the lens speed is fast as long as you have an object you are focusing on. The action option will truly only work well if you are focused on a fast moving object, otherwise the lens will stall and the photo comes out yellow and foggy. (But why would you be using action if there wasn't anything moving, anyway?) On Auto, it is difficult to take a picture of anything close (Say, within  8-6 inches of the lens if it is a larger object) since it will not focus it, but then you can switch it over to Manual if needed and take the photo that way.The camera is attractive, the battery life is decent, the photos are spectacular. It uses a standard SD memory hard which was the same her old camera used. For a beginner, it was easy to pick up and use without the manual, which she still hasn't read. Her only complaint is that you do not see the photos on the LCD before you take the picture, only after.  (hense the 4 instead of 5 stars)The neat thing about the photos as well as the camera lets you adjust the lighting, sepia or black and whites, and color adding right on the camera without putting it onto your computer and using a software. I expect her to share some of those photo contest winnings in due time, with her Nikon in hand.  Nikon lived up to its reputation with this one.

$REVIEW.: I was upgrading from a three year old NetGear RT311 Cable/DSL wired Router because I wanted wireless 802.11b capability. The main reason I bought the SMC Barricade SMC7004VWBR over other wireless routers was the low price.In comparision with my previous router's wired ethernet capabilitues, the SMC Barricade was slightly easier to setup and the web-based setup and maintenance menu is certainly a great improvement.Besides that, it offers a lot of features for the money - DHCP, NAT, Firewall, 64 and 128 bit WEP (Wireless Encription), Status log, etc.Wireless capability for me was a convenience and not a must-have, because my laptop at home is mostly connected via Ethernet. Only with my Sharp Zaurus SL-5500 PDA (with Linksys WCF12 WiFi CompactFlash card) did I really need wireless.Using the SMC EZ Connect Wireless PC Card on my Dell Inspiron (running Windows 2000) I noticed the signal strength was nearly 100% upto 20' away from the router. When I took the laptop to my bedroom, about 30' away from the router and separated by two dry walls, the signal strength dropped to 50%, but with no loss in connection. The Sharp Zaurus SL-5500 PDA with Linksys card similarly had no loss of connection.The only time I did notice a problem was when one morning the wireless network suddenly stopped functioning (whereas the wired ethernet network continued without a problem). I had to do a reset of the router (using the web menu) and then the wireless began functioning again.My bottomline recommendation is to get this router if wired ethernet is essential and wireless is not so critical.

 It seems like better protection than most and although it does fit very snugly when you first get it which makes it a little more difficult to take off, it will get a bit looser with use and that will no longer be an issue
I do like this one and yes it is small but so much better than using the on screen keyboard- which I can't stand for any amount of time

For some reason, I wanted to purchase it at a local Best Buy in case I wanted to return it or for warranty issues. For me, this tablet is very good because it is small enough to not be cumbersome to take wherever I go in my purse. I bought the ScanDisk class 10 64GB micro SD card and my husband formatted it in Fat 32 so that I can use it ( SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-064G-U46A ). I also got the CaseCrown case for it ( CaseCrown Ridge Standby Case (Purple) for Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 and 7.0 Plus ). So basically you can get a lightweight 64GB  tablet and case for less than $330. If you want to move your apps to your SD card, there's an app called "Link2SD" that will let you do it in Ice Cream Sandwich. If you got the 64GB SD card like I did, you need to partition it before you can use the Link2SD app. I have not used the keyboard yet, so I won't comment on that, but with the package, I got it free. I like this tablet because it's small and portable enough to carry where you want and it's inexpensive, so you don't mind your children playing with it--especially with the above case (which I highly recommend if you have small children that want to play apps on your tablet. If you don't need to all the features of the CaseCrown (being able to stand in portrait and landscape and the stand actually working), then the SupCase may be the one for you--it is lighter, but for me less functional for a person with a child who uses it. For my older son who is in college, we opted to get him the ASUS Transformer Infinity with docking station along with the case for the tablet and docking station ( Poetic ASUS Transformer Pad Infinity TF700 / TF700 Keyboard Mobile Dock and Tablet ). Both come with lots of software including HP e-print that finds your hp printer and automatically prints as well as Polaris Office. My son just needed a bigger and more powerful tablet that is truly more like a laptop that can transform into a tablet. He wanted to be able to download and use more graphics intensive apps and programs so that tablet was a better fit for him as a engineering college student. Quite honestly, we got both of our tablets for about what we would have paid for an Ipad with 64GB... Oh yes, if you do get this tablet, you will need more memory if you want to really be able to use it. You may not want to have to deal with formatting a 64GB SD card, but you do want some kind of extra storage. Also, if the tablet starts running really slowly over time after you've downloaded a lot of apps, remember it's like a computer...turn if off and back on every once in a while and it will most likely all of a sudden start going fast again.--Just remembered...if you have small toddlers or even small children that use your tablet or phone, there's a free app called Zoodles that is very good. You put all the apps you want them to have access to in it and it keeps them there. It has lots of free children's apps and videos included in it and it keeps them from changing settings on your device, accidentally purchasing apps, or going onto the ads that are so easy to click on that are on the free children's apps. Just remember to choose the option of the child exiting with Zoodles instead of with your normal phone (If that option doesn't come up, you're fine. If it does, you'll know what I'm talking about because if you choose using the phone, your child will be able to exit at will, which would defeat the purpose of having this for a young child. If the child is older and you just want the app for the free content, but not the parental control, then select exiting with your phone). This app also only works where there is a wifi or internet connection.--Hope this helps

$REVIEW.: They're a little tricky to put on without getting some bubbles, but I, unlike many people, couldn't care less about bubbles. When the screen is on they're hardly noticeable, and I'll take bubbles over scratching my Vita. I know the bubbles can be removed with a simple removal of the screen protector, and that's enough for me to just leave it on and appreciate the protection it gives. If you mess up putting it on you get three sets anyways, but I'm sure I'll mess up putting on all three so I've just left on the first and am happy with it. I Like that it covers the entire front of the Vita, and a protector for the back touchscreen is nice too.

(I still have my original Clip, that has survived 2 clip+, and 2 clip zip). I haven't use it much, I haven't dropped, and it just died in my hands. No apparent reason, it become a brick. The prior one was dropped once, and the on/of button was damaged. To use it I had to destroy the enclosure, and then turn it on, but no more off button, so, it keeps playing until the battery dies. Ok. so this ends our relationship dear sansa. we had good times, but all your lines are going into the cheap build arena. I will stick with my Fuze original, and look for a smaller player from a competitor.

$review_text.: I'm a fan of Harmon-Kardon/JBL products in general, having purchased my first 2 JBL bookshelf speakers (with 14" woofers) back in the early '70s.  So I was favorably disposed to the SoundSticks even before appreciating their unique, crystalline appearance (they've become objets d'art in the Museum of Modern Art). I rather quickly went through 2 generations of SoundSticks.  They served me well, for the first year, but then I would begin having problems with a speaker shorting in and out and no possibility of repair (the SoundSticks have no user-, or for that matter, technician-accessible parts). Each of the first two SoundStick units were available from Amazon for around a hundred per pair.  But now that SoundSticks III are approaching two hundred, it's become difficult to renew a long-time attachment to the JBL-Harman line (though my Harman-Kardon receiver is still going strong).Clearly, it was time to look at the new kid on the block, the Cyber-Acoustics 3602, the most popular 3:1 system on Amazon and, at an bargain price that's likely to go up before it goes down. Moreover, in a blindfold test the sound of the CA speakers is comparable with that of the SoundSticks.  Initially the bass of the CA unit seemed excessive if not overwhelming (from a woofer made of real wood--what will they think of next?).  Then I noticed the handy bass-volume control on the included little "pod."  It wasn't until cutting back the woofer by 2/3rds that the stunning clarity of the satellite speakers emerged.  The sound may not be as "flattering" to the musician-performers as the somewhat "enhanced" audio from the SoundSticks (each with 4 JBL speakers), but what I'm hearing strikes me as more accurate, revealing, natural.  The main points:Appearance:The SoundSticks have the "Wow" factor, but even the spare HK instructions suggest that you put them under your desk, out of sight, so it's not as though the 3 pieces are all that evident to your friends (unless you have a MOMA-like little theater in your man-cave).  The 2 SoundSticks are considerably heavier, because of the the lead base (not bass), and they're an inch or two taller to accommodate the extra speakers.  Still, the CyberAcoustics satellites are solid enough to stay in place, and their sound is more accurate if slightly less enhanced.  The two speakers in each of the CA satellites are exposed, so the user must be careful not to stick a finger or thumb through one of them. Also they're ported at the top.  The SoundSticks, on the other hand, enclose the 4 speakers completely inside each column, out of harm's way, with a port at the bottom rather than the top.Sound:Again, the 3-piece SoundSticks sound different (slightly more spacious, rich and full) but not necessarily better.  Both CA and HK units have sub-woofers capable of drowning out the mids and highs of the satellite speakers not to mention bombing the user-listener into senselessness.  With the SoundSticks you have to get down on the floor to change the volume setting of the subwoofer (which is rarely necessary); with the Cyber Acoustics the volume setting of the subwoofer is on a remote control--a little puck that sits right on your desk, within easy reach. In short, both units have bass to spare.Flexibility:Here's where the Cyber Acoustics 3602 really stand-out, your quintessential "A" student.  Because of that little puck you can turn the speakers on and off and control woofer balance as well as general volume right from your desktop.  With the SoundSticks you have to get down on the floor to turn the system on and off or to adjust the output from the sub-woofer.  The general volume control is a gimmicky (but not all that convenient) "touch" surface area of the right satellite.  Finally, whereas the SoundSticks have no inputs (like the CA 3606 they have a stereo 3.5 mini-plug going out to your computer or output source), the CA 3606 has two "extra" inputs on its multi-talented little puck.  So you can plug in headphones without rearranging the back of your computer AND you can plug in an auxiliary player or tuner without undoing the primary connection (to a computer in most cases).  Finally, the CA people have thoughtfully included an iPod stand (put it next to your puck, and insert it via an enclosed shorty cord) as well as instructions more complete than those with the SoundSticks.Practicality and durability:Too soon for a reliable report. but I've had problems after the first year with both SoundSticks I and SoundSticks II--small wiring problems leading to shorting out (it's hard not to occasionally kick the sub that's under your desk or nudge the satellites placed in the confusion of a typical desk top).  Eventually a "small" problem like the shorting out of a single satellite becomes major and a fix proves impractical or cost-prohibitive.  The sub-woofers of the two systems are comparable in size and weight, and both accept a plug with tiny pins that the user must be careful not to bend out of alignment.  Frankly, the CA plug looks more user-accessible and, assuming company support is responsive, it would be a small matter to solder a new plug to replace one with bent pins.In conclusion, this particular 3-piece Cyber Acoustics unit is inarguably the best value in computer speakers. It's a fraction of the price of the SoundSticks II yet equal to the latter in audio quality (imo) and superior in terms of adaptability.  Logistics offers speakers in this price range, but not competitive in terms of quality (the top-seller ones going for ten are inferior to the onboard speakers in my iMac).  This, my 2nd Cyber Acoustics product, has exceeded expectations.  And if it breaks down after a year, I certainly won't feel I didn't get my money's worth. By then, I'm likely to concede that the subwoofer is taking up excessive space under my desk and is really not needed. (Witness what a small Tivoli or Bose speaker can do without one.  At that time, I'd look seriously at the JBL Duet speakers (a 2-piece unit that's about ten dollars less than this one).

$REVIEW.: While this fan was working in my Silverstone RV02B-EW case (middle one, right below the graphics card), it provided plenty of airflow with minimal noise

 However, it died less than a month after the warranty expired


 I keep my case relatively clean with bi-monthly cleanings with a vacuum/soft brush attachment, and this case doesn't really get that dusty anyway with all the positive air pressure.The 1 year warranty is a bit pathetic, but I'm going to buy another one of these regardless since nobody else makes 180mm fans.

$review_text.: GOOD: Nice cheap over the ear headphones. Takes more fiddling to fit but it fits nicely. THis type of earphone is good for running, sports, over the ear doesn't tug, and cord  friction sound is less pronounced.BAD: Volume. I have these playing at max volume on my computer and on my cell phone - and it sounds 1/2 the volume of my other ear buds. I tried burning in but it doesn't help, i tried different inserts, positioning... nothing helps. Also moving my jaw back and forth or turning my head all the way, produces noticeable changes/muffling of the sound. (You may wonder if phones are properly fit and have a good seal - they do - not too tight, not too loose). Maybe i have a defective pair?!  I should also mentioned that the first one i got i had to return b/c left bud wasn't working. Lastly, and this is a minor issue, the cord itself is light but it has "memory" - i.e. the bends and the kinks in the cord stay and are impossible to get rid off.INFO: M6P comes with the "pause/play" button, M6 doesn't have this.  Pause/play works as expected on my android phone.

$REVIEW.: Product: APC Backup-UPS ES 8-Outlet 550VARating: 3/5 (good)I bought one of these units several years ago at my local computer/electronics stores ... not to protect a PC, but rather to protect my phone answering machine, cable box, and most importantly my new (and then quite expensive) Flatscreen TV.  It's done a very admirable job, and I only recently re-gifted it to a family member, after replacing it with a newer model 1300.Advantages:* Easy to use, right out of the box.* Multiple connection types and outlets.* Low space-saving profile, easily fitting inside or under small cabinets and tables.Disadvantages:* Small battery offers very limited runtime (figure 7-10 mins).* Lacks built-in digital display showing load and remaining runtime.* Lacks manual bypass for loud audible power-outtage alarm.Bottom line: this is a very decent no-frills unit if you're on a budget.  However, an increasing array of newer units with status displays are becoming cost competitive.  Lastly, if your power blinks frequently, the lack of an alarm bypass can become annoying.-----------------TIP: Most UPSs have limited runtime. For example, the XS-1300 I replaced 550 with only holds 7AH of power (which will run my PC for just under 1 hour).  To greatly extend this, I bought a big 55AH sealed marine gel battery, a trickle charger, and a 400W inverter.  When the power goes out, that gives me the option of plugging either my UPS/PC or my UPS/TV setups into the 55AH battery for an additional 8+ hours of runtime.

Also if your video card is too wide, then the PCIExp x1 will be unusable, since it will be below the video card.I build a Gamming PC with this motherboard and it performs just right, it supports up to 32 Gb RAM, (I just have 8 Gb right now, but planning to go 16 Gb), so that is a plus.If you need to read more about this motherboard i recommend to search it in the Gigabyte site.

$review_text.: I bought this Acer Ultrabook last October.  It runs pretty fast and &#34;clean' on Window 8 for me.  It is light, stylish & well-designed.  It did take me a week or so to manage the over-sensitive touch pad and keyboard.  But not a problem for me. The battery life needs improvement as many suggested.  I am impressed by its overall quality.One note - I really don't like the awkward and anti-intuitive Window 8 platform.
$SUMMARY.: Nice Ultrabook!

They then would do nothing because the "original order" was over 6 weeks old.  Amazing.  I guess that's how they "get you" ... on a technicality or worst ... they have a stock of bad products that only last a few WEEKS and when the first fails, they send another dud.  I highly recommend not ordering ANYTHING from them.

$review_text.: The AR Drone 2 is amazing. A bug initially caused me some problems that required warranty repair but after a week of constant flying I can say that the issue I had that resulted in a full shutdown in flight have been resolved.The Parrot folks were great about covering this issue under warranty and were very polite and helpful on the phone. The tech said for some reason the iOS location services might be causing this issue. I do suggest making sure your drone has the latest software update installed before flying.Here's my experiences so far:It is remarkably easy to control and the tablet/smartphone integration is simply incredible. The drone stays stable even when there's a light wind. It was neat to watch it correct its flight pattern when encountering wind gusts, etc.  It even saved itself from a crash at one point. Very impressive.The video quality out of the camera is very good and I had no problems recording to an older Sandisk USB stick.The learning curve on the controls is very quick. It did not take long before I was able to conduct very precise maneuvers and fly at a fairly quick speed around my backyard.  I do suggest trying it indoors to start so that you can get a feel for how it handles.The indoor bumpers it comes with will prevent severe damage to your home, but I do suggest not flying it over items that might blow away as it flies over. I was surprised by how much air this thing can move, and how much that air could move objects I didn't think would be moved!The altitude it can reach is impressive.  Better than expected.  But the higher you go the greater the wind, so I do suggest learning how to fly it to keep it from drifting away. Last night I sent my drone up to its max altitude (about 300 feet) and was working quite a bit to keep it from drifting away. It returned some amazing video.Thankfully there's a setting to limit the max altitude, so if you have kids I'd suggest letting them use it at a lower setting to avoid losing your $300 toy.The propellers will not chop off your fingers but they do hurt when touched. I had to grab it out of the air a few times to prevent damage to my home, and it was not pleasant. I can imagine it being more painful for a child.Battery life is so-so. You'll get an enjoyable 15-30 minutes of flight time before you'll need to plug in the battery and wait approximately 90 minutes for the next charge. This is fine for adults perhaps, but kids looking for an afternoon of playtime will be disappointed. You might want to get a few extra batteries to keep them entertained.It's not delicate, but I was surprised that it broke so easily when I encountered the control bug. There really is no give on the legs that it uses to land, so if it hits the ground hard it will break.I have crashed it twice since and did not have any major issues, although a high altitude plunge into a row of hedges (lucky for me) resulted in having to take apart the drone to reseat a connector. The drone's body is constructed out of heavy duty foam (similar to a bike helmet) and each crash has taken small chunks out of the fuselage. I suspect that over time it's going to get quite battle scarred.Parrot has great instructional videos for repairing your drone, and replacement parts are fairly reasonably priced.  I will keep updating this as my experience continues, but overall it functions as promised and exceeded my expectations. I'm really enjoying it.

$REVIEW.: At the time of this review writing there are limited choices currently available for Samsung's year 2014's current flagship products namelySamsung Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2 (32GB, Black)& orSamsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 (32GB, Black)Since the choices are limited and if you still need a decent matching case & full size Bluetooth keyboard for your newly acquired tablet 12.2 you will find this will fit the bill. Granted it is still very expensive for a mere 'keyboard case' but in my past experiences that is how most of the newly released hot gadgets are. Time will make these more affordable once more consumers buy them and as popularity increases on Samsung 12.2 tablets.Having said, I must admit that I still officially do not own aSamsung Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2 (32GB, Black)and I had to borrow it from my colleague at office for few hours to test the product for Amazon. I will eventually buy aSamsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 (32GB, Black)for my daughter and it is in her wishlist! not to mention in my tinker list :)For the few hours of testing I did with this Logitech Pro Protective case I found the device well made & large keyboard makes typing quite comfortable. I wish that Logitech would have made a back-light function for better illumination of the keys in the dark. Paring was super easy and held a steady Bluetooth connection for 3-4 hours I had this for testing. Typing with the keyboard was not that difficult but still needed some time to practice.The tablet is held in place with what Logitech calls 'SecureLock' System, But I think it is not really very secure if you are careless. It has the tendency to fall out of place very easily. It can be a good thing if you merely would like to have this case for the keyboard use and need a way to quickly attach/detach the case but if you want this to be your default carrying case I would suggest that you take caution when you open and use it as it has a potential to come out very easily. The nylon like backing makes this case slightly slippery when you hands are moist. Please be careful when you open and close the case.It includes 'charging cable' and the battery lasts for months as per specs but I have not owned it for that long. I am keeping the case which I received for review and will use it once I purchaseSamsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 (32GB, Black)for my daughter. Based on the fact that it is decent enough and did not have any glaring issues I am currently rating this with 3 respectable stars. I will revise my review once I have had the chance to play with it more.Thanks for reading my review.

$review_text.: I'm using AlienBees on these stands (the B400 model) and the cushion doesn't exist when the lights are on the stands.  If I release a section the light will fall pretty hard.  When there's no light on the stand it feels like there's some cushion in there (only air cushion because there's no spring at the bottom like other cushioned stands).  I also received one that was deformed I guess you would say.  The clamp on the second section doesn't line up with the clamp on the first section. It functions, just looks awkward. The stands are sturdy and look nice, but I can't give this a perfect score due to the issues I previously mentioned.I own another CowboyStudio model stand that I recommend more than this model (the 9 foot Heavy duty Cushioned Premium Black Light Stand that sell for twenty five dollars on Amazon):[...]

$REVIEW.: Just bought this with my new XZ-1. Great deal at under $5. Thanks to previous reviews, I knew that it did not have a belt loop, so that wasn't a disappointment for me. The case is high quality. Very snug fit, but I had no problem closing it with the lens cap on like the other reviewer. It is tight, but I suspect as it wears it will become easier to close. It did come with a decent 4GB Toshiba SDHC card. It might be nicer if it had a small pocket for an extra SD card or battery, but that would add bulk. As it is, this is a nice compact walk around case. One thing to note, with the neck strap on the camera, it is a little crazy because you end up with two straps hanging out. You could probably get away with just using the camera neck strap and taking the case strap off, but you would then have to pocket the case when in use. The other alternative is to get a wrist strap for the camera. I suspect that solution will work better.
$review_summary.: Excellent deal!

$review_text.: I'm so in love with this player already, the screen is beautiful and easy on the eyes. Was easy to set up.  Even non blue-ray disks were crystal clear.Comes with a handy travel bag and an adapter which allows you to play the movie in the player and watch it on your bigger tv screen at home using either audio/video composite cables or HDMI.  Neither the composite or HDMI cable is supplied.  There's an on/off switch on the bottom of the player to save your battery life in addition to the Power-on switch on the player itself.Mine makes noises when I insert the movie but stops after loading..so hopefully that won't be an issue later on.  And I wish the manual had said the time it takes to charge the player and how long a charge lasts but I couldn't find it, but it does come with a car charger.  Also it comes with a paper manual which I like much better than one on a cd.I highly recommend this player.

Everyone things about surge protection with desktop PC's and televisions, but plug a five hundred dollar phone into a regular outlet without a second thought

$REVIEW.: This laptop is overheat central. Meaning at times, it will randomly shut itself down.Let me give you the rundown of how bad of an issue this is.For reviewing purposes I will use League of Legends as my game of choice to compare my old laptop to this one.I own a very old Toshiba Portege which houses a Centrino chip. A CENTRINO PROCESSOR GUYS. That is ancient. Anyway, I play LoL on the LOWEST graphics settings and only get about 30 fps, and yet, that laptop NEVER overheats.I've owned this Acer laptop since February, and I play LoL on the HIGHEST graphics settings and get great fps of around 60-80. This means that the laptop is perfectly capable of handling the game. Though, obviously and to no surprise as with many Acer products, over time it WILL overheat. So I thought to myself, "Okay, maybe the graphic settings are pushing this laptop too far."Wrong.I then proceed to play LoL on the LOWEST graphics settings and yet, it STILL overheats. You know what's the worse part about this? LoL is not even a graphic intensive game! Meaning if this laptop overheats with a game like LoL, it will definitely fry itself over games like BF3 or Skyrim.Before you think to yourself, "What an idiot! There are many remedies to this problem!"- I bought a cooling fan to place underneath the laptop as I play games, STILL OVERHEATS.- I even use Throttlestop to limit the processor and its load so that the temperatures can be reduced, which they did, STILL OVERHEATS.- I constantly monitor the temperatures with CPUID as I play games, the temps NEVER REACH 70 Celsius (they only go to high 60s, which is actually quite low) thanks to my tweaks with Throttlestop, STILL OVERHEATS.Ultimately, I will give it 3 stars simply because it is quite fast in its own right. BUT! Since it houses a graphics card which will naturally catch the attention of budget gamers, and is one of the main reasons why I bought it, I cannot help myself but tell potential buyers this: "DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP IF YOU ARE A GAMER! If you are NOT a gamer, it's a pretty solid laptop." Is there a way to bold texts on Amazon? Because I will have to repeat myself.I mean honestly, why throw in a graphics card if the vent system sucks? The graphics card raises the price of the laptop, and yet, you can't even enjoy the graphics card to its fullest potential with such a terrible vent system.In other words, you can find a different laptop JUST AS STRONG as this one, and WITHOUT a graphics card, for a CHEAPER price."DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP IF YOU ARE A GAMER! If you are not a gamer, it's a pretty solid laptop."

$review_text.: So far the best motherboard I have ever owned

Runs very stable


I will consider it overkill for gaming application


My cpu comes with a base clock of 3.4 mgz that you could run in Energy Saving mode and Standard Mode


Then you can run it in Turbo Mode at 3.9 mgz but it reads at 4.1 on the contrary


My experience is that it really doesn't make any difference at all from any of the previous modes


This why I call it overkill
I'm having some issues with memory and had a few share of BSOD

It came out that the memory I bought is not in the compatibility list from ASUS


So probably that is the culprit.But it has it's merits and indeed is a good inversion for long time use and reliability


Don't buy it thinking it will be an overclocking out of this world experience

Yes it can overclock like a dream but the practicality at least to me is not worth pushing it to the limit when the stock speed is more than sufficient

It's good for overclockers addicts out there to play with for the sake of it
Really is not necessary.

$REVIEW.: I had our 60&#34; Vizio mounted for a week and was planning on just doing some of the wire channels painted to match, finally I caved in and ordered this kit

After much shopping around this was great &#34;bang for your buck&#34;
You can try and piece your kit together but will end up spending the same if not more.Installation was straight forward, I am fairly handy though and have done some novice electrical work so honestly I skipped the instructions therefore can't comment on how well or poor they are written.The advice was given in another review but I want to stress again, just because your wires fit while you have them running down the wall does not mean they will fit once you have them going over, in down, and back up
Make sure before beginning that your cables are long enough, once you think you know the right size, add a foot, you can always tuck the excess into the wall.I really liked the fact that this kit had a lower connector so you can run from a surge protector before going up to the wall outlet, other kits and most self-installs I've seen that people do with 'pieced together' kits are tapped into an existing outlet which means your expensive new TV is without surge protection
 The included extension cord could be a little more flexible though and the head that plugs into the lower outlet is pretty large, if it was not recessed the power cord would not of fit behind my wall mounted entertainment center.Overall, great kit for those looking for a single package that does it all.

$REVIEW.: I decided to give my old Mac Mini to family.  However the original 2GB was holding it back for Mountain Lion, or modern Web Browsers.  This took care of the problem and renewed this Mac Mini for another 3yrs or more.  (Side Note:  Ended up keeping Snow Leopard, as it is one of the best OS releases by Apple and is big on compatibility both backward and forward)

$review_text.: Third reviewUpdate December 2012After receiving a new speaker from last review, in just a little more than a year it stopped working just like it did before


This again was really a bum.My dad has had a Bose speaker for 5 years and not once has it stopped working.I am very disappointed and now even though I didn't want to buy a Bose speaker because I thought it was to expensive I will have to buy one since I know don't trust any other.Philips I gave you a chance and you failed :(Second reviewUpdate November 2011After really enjoying my speaker for a long time suddenly it stopped working! We don't know why it happened but I could not get the speaker to work


The only thing that did work was the plus and minus signs located in the middle of the speaker which continuously blinked as if it was trying to tell me something but after reviewing the manual, checking the web for the problem, speaking with phillips service guy there was nothing they could do except receive the new one and wait for an inspection.I was bummed so I spoke to amazon customer service and I let them know about the problem even though it was way pass my warranty

Fortunately, Amazon sent a NEW ONE in a few days with the condition that I sent the non working one
WOW AMAZING customer service! Hurray for AMAZON.I have the new one and this one works just as great


I use it practically every day, the sound is great and I would like to add that the remote control is much neater than the BOSE remote control and works better too.So because of this problem I would downgrade my review to two stars but thanks to Amazon Customer SERVICE it will remain on four stars.First reviewNot much to say! Bought with a special discount from Amazon and it is much better than I expected


The design looks great and it even looks neater then the BOSE dock.However, the BOSE dock has, without question, better sound in terms of deep bass and also when the volume is very high

But well, Bose costs almost 200 $ more.If you are not a high critic on minor sound issues, this product is definitely a better deal for you.If you absolutely must have the best sound and don't mind paying for it, then the BOSE dock is better for you.

$REVIEW.: After that it would not connect to a web browser.  Synology Assistant shows it's status a "Ready" and provides a IP address but the browser will not connect. Others on the Synology forum seem to be having the same issue but it's apparently not too widespread. Synology support has been less than helpful: "Try connecting it direct to your PC" .

$REVIEW.: At first I was skeptical about buying this product due to others commenting on the odd noises that come from the fans after this product is installed. However, I've had no problems with any peculiar noises, or buzzing and am very pleased with the performance.I have it hooked up to 3SilverStone 120mm Shining Blue LED Case Fan with Rifle Bearing Noise Level 26.6 Db FN121-BLand 2NZXT 120mm Performance Case Fan FN 120RB (Black/White)(the NZXT's came with my case).These fans run near silent at 40% power and still move a considerable amount of air. In addition, at 100% power, the fans are still almost silent while moving alot of air. However, my fans are not really high performance, so if your looking for fans that can move more air.. then your average noise level will go up.When i opened the box, I was greeted by a mess of wires. At first, it was an eye sore but after careful organization of the temperature probes and the fan connectors, it was looking good in no time. Also, if you have cable management in your case it  it much easier to hide and organize the cables.The LCD screen is nice and bright without being obnoxious. The touch screen is nice, but sometimes has a little trouble responding to a touch or two... but that only happens once and a while.The Auto function is amazing at keeping you case cool and the manual is good for keeping the fans at a desired noise level. And you can set an alarm to notify you when the temperature rises above a specified levelThe tape that comes with the temperature probes are not high quality, they have trouble applying and wont stay in place. But, that is easily fixed.All in all, this product is great and for only 28$ its a steal.

$REVIEW.: ....therefore it isn't quite as useful to me. I don't quite know why, but I thought this was a wireless kind of device and it is not. It is merely an electronic device that allows for the use of your electrical wiring as an internet signal provider, or should I say carrier to be more exact.The advantage to using this device is for larger places (I live in an apartment) where the modem/router is far away from a potential internet user. By using this device, someone far from the router could still receive a signal using ethernet cables and this device. It certainly beats running wires all over the place. To that end, I have yet to try it, so my review is limited in scope.For my apartment it worked, but then again, it works just fine without it as well. I ordered this device thinking it was something else and so my review is equally limited. Sorry...

$REVIEW.: If planing on replacing both speakers, you must buy quantity: 2. They come individually in singles. I replaced the front speakers in my 1998 Honda Civic 4 Door sedan. For the price, they are great. What do you want from a pair of speakers for less than $20 bucks?!?!?! In any case, MUCH better then stock, easy direct drop in (no mods) I'm happy! Now if you want something better, obviously buy some better speakers, these are by no mean "high end", but if you're just looking to replace some junk old speakers (or blown ones for that matter) you won't be disappointed with these!

$review_text.: This cool little camera packs in the features without the price.  No, the video quality isn't great, no the color reproduction is pretty far off, but for 50 bucks to monitor my house, it's priceless.That said, yes, the instructions are completely worthless.  The "brochure" that it comes with talks about running a specific program on the CD, but that program doesn't exist, you have to run a different one.For someone like myself, a software developer and one who knows his way around networks and routers, it really wasn't difficult to set up, and the software seemed pretty solid.  But I can certainly understand a casual user having issues with the setup.About the only thing I wish this had an option for was a date/time stamp embedded on the video itself.

$review_text.: I paid somewhat less than the current advertised price, and for that it was a bargain. Perfect replacement for the 27&#34; we bought back in 2004 which suddenly stopped working. If I get 9 years of use out of this one I will be happy indeed. There's not that much to say about flat screen tvs at this size and price - they all seem to look similar to me, and a little tweaking of the settings allows you to get it looking how you want. Sound is perfectly adequate for a bedroom, picture is visible in bright daylight, remote is simple and gets the job done. A couple of screws to put on the stand and you're done.

$REVIEW.: I've been using this mouse daily for about a year now and It's very good, but it could be better. I don't really feel like writing out an entire review word by word, so I'll just make a pro/con list instead. It's easier for you to sit through too.PROS:BlueTrack-It works on almost all surfacesSmooth scroll wheel- You get to exactly where you want to be on a page.Battery-Between three and four months (with hours of daily use) on a single AA battery.Range-It's good to about twelve feet regardless of position, or twenty with a line of sight.Size-It's not very big, so it can easily be taken with you, but not so small that it's uncomfortable to use.Strength-This mouse can take a beating. A year of daily use and it doesn't have any marks or scuffs.Receiver-The receiver is both tiny and stores in the mouse for travel.On/off switch-If you plan to not use it for a while, it has an on/off switch.CONS:The side buttons are in just the wrong place so neither your thumbs or index fingers can comfortably reach them.The sensor is slow. You can bump up the speed using Preferences on a Mac, but that's artificial and of no use for gaming. I can't say for sure on the windows side, but artificial speed bumps are not for gamers.There is a very slight bit of lag, not a problem for normal use but for gaming it's awful.Also, the finish will get very slippery while gaming.All in all, it's an exceptional mouse. Prior to using this I would be constantly switching mouses to find one that worked. While it's certainly not a gaming mouse in any way, for daily use it's fantastic. I'm switching to a Razer Naga soon, because of the massive number of programmable buttons, wired for no lag, and much faster sensor.

$review_text.: I was looking for something with a little more color than the plain black cover my husband had given  me.  This cover was just the ticket.  I like the red color.  I didn't experience the smell that others complained about with my cover.  Came with very minimal instructions for mounting.  I like the fact the the mounting brackets have cutouts to accomodate the speakers for my fire.  The standing feature is really nice as I watch videos quite often when I am lying in bed and so far it is staying put.  I love the strap that keeps the front closed as I have my fire in my purse quite often. My only fear is that the case will start to crack after alot of use from the standing feature.

$review_text.: This is a strict WARNING to anyone thinking about buying this product. Don't...do...it! You will notice this particular product and a couple other products just like it are distributed through several different companies but are produced by the same contractor. The design of the product is great but the quality of the manufacturing is completely unacceptable. I purchased this product 3 different times and each time the same problem occurred. The second time you charge this product, the laser under the trackball ceases to function and the product then becomes useless. This happened to me both times and as well, both times the laser pointer did NOT work. I thought this product was great until it's flaws showed through.After doing a little bit of research, I found this product is manufactured by a single contractor however, it is distributed and sold through several different front companies. The reason for this is because the product is cheap and if one company gets a bad reputation for the product quality being junk those reviews won't affect the same product being sold under a different company. I know there are reviews that state this product does work but don't be fooled. This product is NOT quality and WILL cease to function after being charged a second time.Amazon should investigate into who is manufacturing this product as well as the BBB because they are ripping people off. You have been WARNED!

$REVIEW.: The first thing I like about these headphones is the way in which they deploy. There's a base station which can connect to just about any device which produces sound. There's a 3.5mm input jack, as well as component inputs for an xbox or playstation, and a mini usb for ps3 voice chat. Whatever sound is being received by the base station is sent to the headset, so you can really use them for anything without having to mess with any settings or configurations - you can easily hook up your computer, stereo, MP3 player, xbox, ps3, you name it. Logitech was also kind enough to include all of the cables you might need, except the 3.5 mm audio in. The volume control, mic volume, mute button, and power switch on the left ear. The only design downside I can see is that for xbox voice chat, you have to run a cord from the headphones to the controller, which I can see being annoying.The headphones use rechargeable battery (connects via USB type B cord to the base station), which lasts about 10 hours. The range is impressive - I could get about 25~30 feet away from the base station before I started having audio issues.Lastly the sound quality is fantastic. You can really hear the deep basses, and it sounds great when the volume is high. Lately I've been using them when I want to blast metallica late at night after the kids have gone to bed and this headset gives me better sound quality than any other headset or headphones I own - hands down.

It was purchased to replace a Kodak C875 that may go down as the best point-and-shoot I ever own.  For what it was, it offered a ton of options to control your photos, and I expected more of the same from this one.  Well, it isn't in there.

$review_text.: I bought this flash to use as an off camera  slave fill which is what it appears to be designed for.  It has a small 38M  (@ ISO100) guide number so you will find this to be under powered if you use this as a main flash mounted in the camera hot shoe.  Perfectly adequate for close subjects with either a wide aperture or high ISO setting on your camera.This flash IS NOT automatic.... When mounted in the hot shoe of the camera as your only flash, you must compute the correct f stop setting or do some trial and error photos.If you are looking for an automatic flash take a look at Neewer's TT660Other things I like:There is a built in diffuser and white bounce panel which easily retract from a storage position in the head.Very easy to adjust the power setting using either a + or - button.Self powers off to conserve battery power.Comes with a felt bag to protect the flash and a handy plastic foot/stand  that attaches to the hot shoe mountWhy 4 out of 5 stars:The head angle bounce adjustment feels rough as it moves between the various detent positions.The retractable diffuser arrived broken off. Amazon quickly handled a return and a second unit was purchased with no issueThe hot shoe lock ring is made of plastic and I don't like the feel of it when tightening it.  I am afraid of over tightening it and cracking it.

$REVIEW.: Considerably smaller than I expected and the stand portion in back pivots but won't stay in place past a certain angle, on a smooth surface....but on other surfaces it should work fine....mostly wish it was a little larger, more substantial feeling...but for the price it will get the job done. Even though it's small the material feels solid and well constructed. Not necessarily the one I'd order next time....but was very inexpensive so no major complaints.

$review_text.: Since there are lots of comments about the lead lengths, maybe some data would help (why is it not in the official specs?).  Here are the approximate lengths that came with mine:Power input cord:  6ft 6in (to sub)Wired remote: 5ft 6in (from sub)Audio input: 6ft 2in (Three 3.5mm male stereo jack plugs on each end; green (front); black (rear); orange (center+sub)Center speaker: 7ft 2inFront speakers: 5ft 3inRear speakers: 14ft 2inThere is also an 8in adapter with a green stereo socket on one end, red and white female RCAs on the other (for use with a video game console).If you only have a single stereo output to feed these speakers you will only get sound out of the two fronts and the sub, unless you select matrix.  Personally I find the matrix mode artificial sounding and hard to listen to, but it seems a waste to only use two of the five speakers so I piggy-backed two one-to-two stereo adapters to make three outputs and plugged in the green, black and orange input plugs (somebody suggested a Radio Shack Boostaroo, but I think that requires batteries - I get plenty of output with the passive one-to-three split).  The rear speakers can then be placed alongside the front speakers and the center speaker puts out the sum of the two stereo channels.  This gives a very acceptable sound when plugged into the headphone output of the TV and volume can be set with the TV remote.  This sound is very much better than the sound from the TV speakers.  After going through the experimentation to arrive at this setup I am very happy with this purchase.

$REVIEW.: When I bought my notebook with a 60GB HD, I deliberately got a 7200 RPM drive. I also thought that 60GB would last forever.... &lt;SIGH>. Now, with a digital camera that takes 4MB pictures and with things like Streets & Trips consuming a GB, it's just not enough.I wasn't sure how well a USB HD would work but this is SUPER. Even better now that I've matched it with MojoPack ([...]) so I've got a device that I can use on ANYONE'S computer. The ultimate in portability, I'm really pleased.The two minor complaints: my firewire connection doesn't match any of their cables so I'll need to buy that and the plug-in to the LaCie USB cable isn't very secure and slips out pretty easily so you can't be bumping the cable at all!Bottom line though: I'd never know the difference between this and my onboard hard drive. The speed is SUPER!

$REVIEW.: My ancient Pioneer CD player went South a couple of months back and I've been looking for a replacement ever since but didn't find one until now.With the ability to take all the songs of my vinyl records and CD's and convert them all to MP3's makes it that much more convenient to play my music.  I must have had hundreds of 45 rpm and several 78's vinyl records that I eventually converted to MP3's as well as some CD's.I must admit that in my younger years, vinyl records sounded better than the CD's and certainly the MP3's.  But now that I'm in my 70's, my ears are not as critical as to the quality of the music coming out of my player.Anywho, all I wanted was a replacement for my Pioneer CD player and to my surprise this comes with a USB input as well and it works quite well ... Thank You!As it turns out I'm playing more MP3 music than CD's .. so therefore I have ordered a couple more USB devices. LOL!SO FAR ... I LOVE IT!

$REVIEW.: I ordered this privacy screen for the iPad 2 as I was interested in seeing what sort of protection and privacy it could provide.Overall the privacy feature works quite well. However, that is the only part of this screen protector that I found useful.Pros:- privacy feature works well. Viewing the iPad from the side (more than perhaps 20 degrees of offset)Cons:- installation was a giant pain in the rear. I have installed several screen protectors and this was the worst for installation.- the cleaning cloth that 3M provided was the worst I have experienced. It consistently left marks that had to be re-cleaned.- the 'smoothing' card was a simple piece of cardboard that was part of the packaging. This card scratched the screen protector during installation. Poor design and idea there.- the screen protector is far thicker than typical, most likely due to the privacy feature. This made lining up simpler, yet it made it impossible to clear all the bubbles out during installation.- the price point is ridiculous. For $35 I would expect a far superior product. 3M has missed the bus with this one.Overall, if you truly require privacy, ok I get it. I just hope someone else does it better for less.

$REVIEW.: I got this laptop case for myAcer Aspire TimelineX AS3820T-5246 13.3-Inch HD Laptop (Black Brushed Aluminum). It is about what I expected from pictures and specs.The width/length of this laptop case is about 1" bigger than the width/length of my laptop when measured from middle of the side to the middle of the other side so I do not use the divider. However, the corners of this laptop case is rounded so extra space is not available around the corners and the laptop is not moving around. I have also bought a neoprene sleeve for my laptop and I can fit the laptop inside the sleeve into this case but it's a bit tight fit with the neoprene sleeve. There is a velcro strap to secure the laptop into the case which is located 1/3 of the width. I think you can adjust the velcro once and slide the laptop under it.I wish the front pop-up zippered section was actually a bit bigger covering more of the side of the case. However, there is enough pockets/compartments to fit the laptop power supply, a bluetooth mouse, a bluetooth stereo headphones, a slim DVD drive, a cell phone charger plus a few cables without creating too much bulky look.Handle and shoulder strap are comfortable. I wished the strap hook and the anchor was made of metal (they are plastic) but least the hook has a spring loaded locking mechanism so the laptop is unlikely to drop because the strap got unhooked. The zipper is OK but is probably not the sturdiest type. Open and close carefully so as not to damage the zippers.Overall I recommend this laptop case for 13" laptops especially for a price around $25.
$SUMMARY.: Good 13" laptop case for the price

But its lack of clarity and reliability was a serious problem.  the price was attractive but the product, which was made in China, at first use: noises (static) buried the signal. This made it useless to listen or record any voice or sound. Communication with seller (Videosecu) left me the impression that this outfit was not trustworthy.

$review_text.: After using a second generation nano for over four years, I was ready for an upgrade.  I watched with interest over the past few years as Apple continued to add more bells and whistles to the nano line, wondering - why would I ever use a nano to take video?  Why would I want to watch a movie on that tiny screen?It is about time they moved in the direction they did this year - this is a music player, not a smaller wannabe ipod touch.  It is perfect for working out, easy to use, light, battery lasts a long time if you do not leave the display on.I am very happy with this nano so far, have  no complaints other than skipping songs is a bit more challenging then on my older nano - which will force me to rely on playlists more.  I run in the winter in Minneapolis and my nano needs to be tucked away in order to not freeze.Overall - a good upgrade, and as someone else said - a smarter version of the shuffle.12/18/10 UpdateThis is an addition - my ipod worked for a few weeks and now today it died.  I have no idea why and will return this obviously defective product.Also, there is no on-off switch and the nano goes into standby and eventually the battery dies - why they do not have an on-off switch is beyond me.I do not recommend this product anymore.JVD

$review_text.: The cable seems to be made with decent quality, although I was disappointed that the iPhone connector was thicker than an average connector, meaning it is useless if you don't want to keep taking the case off your phone every time you use it. Other than that the cable is fine. The problem is that it did not work well for me. It would sometimes skip while playing songs and other times it would just pause the music. It was not a problem of needing a ground loop isolator, which I also had. Basically the cable was completely useless. It is also very expensive for what it is. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because I never contacted Kensington and it might have just been a problem with my unit. In any case, I returned it immediately and got a refund.I have been looking for a charging/line-out solution for a while. I decided to try out the Kensington 2 in 1 charger despite costing more than I wanted to spend. The other product I tried was the "SendStation PDLO-MiU5 PocketDock Line Out Mini USB Adapter" which worked well initially, but stopped working after a while. If you are willing to give up the ability to charge your phone and just want a line out solution, I would recommend either the "Cables To Go 35508 iPod-Compatible 3.5 mm to Dock Connector Audio Cable" or "Fiio L10" cable. Both are good products that have their advantages and disadvantages (which you can read about in my review of the Cables to Go cable).

$REVIEW.: Gives the Kindle a grippy surface. (not sure grippy is a word, but it gives a textured surface that makes it harder to drop) Thin enough to not bulk up the kindle, but protection to save it from little drops and bumps.  Love it!Update:  Dec. 29, 2013 - I have had the case for about 6 weeks (purchased mid November) and I must say, I love this cover!  It enables me to put it in my purse or work bag without taking up too much space, and the easy grip is the best part of the case!! It doesn't slip out of my hands now!! I tried 3 or 4 other cases, and just wasn't happy. They bulked up the trim Paperwhite without doing what I wanted.  I also bought a stand to put in my purse, first the SHARKK multi angle portable folding stand,SHARKK Multi-Angle Portable Stand for Tablets, E-readers and Smartphones, Durable Aluminum Body, Compatible for Apple iPads, iPad Mini, iPod, iPhone 5 4S 4 3GS; Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, Note 8.0 10.1, S4, S3, S2; Google Nexus 4,7,10; Asus EeePad Transforme...that was nice and heavy.  In fact too heavy!! It now stays on my table permanently because it is so darn heavy.  I also got a lighter weight plastic stand, along with a TPU cover for my tablet, but I use the stand from that order in my purseiShoppingdeals - Smoke TPU Rubber Skin Cover Case and Multi-Angle View Stand Holder for Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0-INCH (SM-T310)It is so much lighter than the SHARKK. The good thing is, I can  use it with or without the stand, and the cover is great!  I haven't found the stand alone, but will keep looking - I want to make sure I have a spare in the event I break the other one.

$review_text.: I purchased this cooler for my new build (Asus Crosshair IV Formula, AMD Phenom II X6 1090T, Antec Three Hundred case with back and top fans on low speed)


 The CPU idles at 29 C


 No matter what I do, I can't get the processor above 40 C - even with HD video encoding!  If you're looking for an air-based cooler for a rig that does all but the most extreme overclocks, I'd give this a serious look.I did knock off some stars for noise (it's not quiet enough for my wife, but it is for me!), installation (a bit difficult if you don't look around for how to do it - the instructions are not too clear), and dimensions (you're gonna need a BIG case for this one).EDIT 1/25/11:  I went into my BIOS and changed the CPU fan profile...this definitely quieted my computer WAY down


 Still idles at 29 C, but temps are up to a sweltering 42 C while doing HD video encoding

 Fan speed was originally at 1950 rpm; now around 700 rpm at idle, up to 975 when under full load
 The two degree tradeoff for quiet operation is well worth it.

$review_text.: I am fairly tech savvy

 That being said, there is no way I could have set the two cameras I purchased up on my own


 I wanted to have the cams visible on my smartphone while I was away
 Setting up port forwarding is much more difficult than I expected
 Foscam was extremely helpful while logging in and setting everything up as I requested


 Now the real reason for the 2 stars
 The cams will not stay connected to my router


 I have an ASUS RT-N56U

 The router is excellent and works flawlessly with everything wireless in my house
 The cams were located less than 20 feet from my router, yet they continued to disconnect from the network
 I even bought a longer antenna for the cam in my basement
 That did not work

 I tried moving the cams to different areas of my house in case there was electronic interference and that didn't work

 I contacted Foscam again to help resolve the issue
 They changed a "Router Control Channel" on my router

 They also recommended a hard reset to each cam

 Neither one of these fixes worked.I do not need technology that makes my life more difficult


 It needs to be the other way around


 I'm sending both back.

$REVIEW.: We use this at our cabin.  We bring a netbook back & forth with us to watch WMC recorded TV shows there.  This remote allows us to put the netbook right up with the TV and not have to get up all the time to skip through commercials.  That it also functions as a remote mouse is a bonus, even if it's a little clumsy.  We find no response problems and it's very easy to use.  Recommended for anyone who's a couch potato.
$SUMMARY.: Works great with Windows 7!

$review_text.: We researched many head phones and decided on either Bose or Koss SportaPro Stereo Headphones. While shopping on ebay we found a pair of Bose at a reasonable price. We purchased them, but even though we paid immediately, the seller chose not to ship the product. We did recover our money, but in the meantime thought we would give the SportaPro a try. I never did get to compare the Bose with the PortaPro, but these head phones give an awesome sound. Not being an audiophile I simply enjoy a great sound. They work well with a Lenova laptop without a sophisticated sound card, and the sound is much better than my Sony Rack system.When I use these headphones, the sound is very strong and all bass and treble notes are both clear and well balanced. Recommend these and the comparative price makes a good value. You don't really need to spend $200 when you can get a high quality unit like the Koss. Am buying some more of these for some Grand Kids.

$review_text.: I bought this radio after reading the other reviews that was listed for this item
I thought I was getting a good radio


Boy, was I wrong! In all fairness, the FM band is pretty good

I'm assuming that the AM band is good too (if I wanted to listen all day to talk radio)


The TV band does not pick up the stations at all--no matter what I do
Also, what I really wanted the radio for was the Weather band so that I'd know what was going on when the power went out

Well, guess what--NO WEATHER BAND EITHER! Can't pick up anything!I feel that if I either wanted to listen all day to talk radio on the AM band or pick up a few stations on the FM band, this radio would have been great


But when you have bad weather coming in and you want to know what is coming your way, this definately is NOT the radio to get
I feel I have wasted my money on this purchase!

$review_text.: Two years ago I spent $90 on a pair of M-Audio AV30 speakers for my work computer. The sound was fantastic but recently they blew a fuse and become inoperable. I didn't want to spend so much money on work computer speakers this time around so I bought these Logitech Z320 speakers.The look and feel and ease of use is fine for $40 speakers. The sound on talk radio (I play KPCC and other talk stations through iTunes) is accepable, but I'm sad to say the musical sound is dull and on two jazz stations that music sounded like it was trapped in a little box.So even though I didn't spend much, I've got buyer's regret with these speakers. I would have been happy spending closer to $100 if I was confident the speakers would last me longer than those M-Audio AV30s.While I'm going to force myself to keep myself for a while, I cannot recommend these for music lovers.Update:After a few hours, the speakers "opened up," as people told me they would, and they don't sound so bad. They're not as good as the M-Audio by a long-shot but they're acceptable. I can live with them.

$review_text.: This looks great on my desk
 I've decided to bring it to work because it can look good and being plugged in will keep both the phone and a spare battery from draining a charge

 BUT - it doesn't charge all that well and needs a bit of wiggling adjustment to make the connection
 On two nights I checked twice to make sure it was charging, and in the morning it was no longer charging and there was little or no charge left at all


 Last night, I checked it about 5 times to make sure it was still charging
 Still, plugged in all night, it only half charged my Thunderbolt
I also need to transfer the extra battery to a charger to top it off and get a full charge

$review_text.: I bought two of these mostly out of curiosity.  Considering their price, I thought that if they don't work, I'm not out anything.  I was pleased at the size and the aluminum casing (black part is all aluminum and the white part is plastic).  I had some MicroSD cards lying about and put music on one, then inserted it into the MP3 player after charging it for a few hours.I'm giving it 4 stars because it does exactly what I expect a $3 MP3 player to do.Reality:-The sound quality is &#34;fair&#34; at best.  I notice hiss and pop that I don't notice on my more expensive MP3 player (a 3+ year old Sansa Fuse 8GB).  I've tried different headphones and this hiss and pop remains.  Using the MicroSD card on my other MP3 player, there is no hiss or pop.-The battery seems to last about 4 hours or so before it needs to be recharged.-There is no &#34;random&#34; or &#34;shuffle&#34; feature, which means you have to listen to songs in alphabetical order by artist.  Fortunately, when you stop the player (either by shutting it off or by pausing the song and then shutting it off) and then restart the player, it picks up where you left off.-It can only take up to an 8GB MicroSD card.-No Battery charge indicator, although it does have a red led that lets you know it is on and when it is charging, it blinks.Despite all of the above, I'm still giving this thing 4 stars.  At less than $3, it more than meets my needs which was for an inexpensive, simple MP3 player I can use while I'm out doing yard work (i.e. something I won't fret over if I get it dirty or if I break it).With a maximum MicroSD capacity of 8GB, I have plenty of music that I can cycle through while mowing the lawn or doing other outdoor chores. If I don't care to listen to a particular song, I can advance to the next song (repeatedly if I want to move to another artist altogether).

$REVIEW.: my home theater setup with this receiver includes the ff: samsung 46" lcd tv, samsung bd-c6800, apple tv2, directv sat receiver, jbl es series speakers (es90 as fronts, es25c as center, es30 as surrounds and es250pwch as my wireless sub). in addition, im also using the icontrolav2 app for ipad2 and iphone 4s...GOT THIS AWESOME RECEIVER IN BB FOR 715$ and i was so happy with it...the first thing that i noticed was the loose power cord connected at the back of this receiver. luckily, i have a spared power cord from my old tv with the same specs and fits really tight...(possible hazard with loose connection such as this one)Upgrading from a very old pioneer receiver, this receiver does so many auto calibrations. After running the MDACC, the receiver's performance was really awesome...it took me a few days to get around and know the overwhelming parameters/settings/adjustments...i was able to program and consolidate all my remotes which includes the blu-ray player, the tv, the sat receiver and including the apple tv2 remote...the bad side though is on the remote, it is long and skinny and buttons are so compressed. it will be nice if pioneer makes it like a logitech harmony 1100 style and size...The free app for ios devices is great. i was able to fully control this receiver on my ipad2 and iphones...even the interface is so neat. i really like the finger equalizer that allows me to customize and save my settings...coupled with the apple tv2, no need to go to my basement just to power it on so i could listen to the music files originating from my itunes library...for extra info, the elite vsx-52 is the same as the pioneer vsx-1121. the 52s have black and gold interface while the 1121s have the black and white...this unit has an msrp of 900 while the 1121 has 800 but for the price that i paid for, it is an awesome deal...comparing the 52 with the 53, there's not much difference though....so paying up and extra 200$ isnt worth it.i have auditioned the vsx-52 with multiple blu-ray movies that includes "the dark knight", "avatar", and even with "the police: certifiable in buenos aires". i was really impressed with power and clarity of the audio and video..i also listened to my music files which was ripped using apple lossless version and some protected aac formats and from dire straits to styx to lifehouse to linkin park, the audio was superb.if you are buying this product, i would suggest to download the manual from pioneer's website so you'll get a heads up before getting the receiver. the installation process was a breeze since i used all hdmi connections.overall, this elite vsx-52 receiver is a great buy. rich in features coupled with an outstanding audio and video processing outputs... automation, if you are planning to use this with your ios devices, was easy. you will have outstanding control while enjoying any of your favorite sources.

$REVIEW.: I have a Dell XPS 9100 desktop, about 4 years old now or so. Not entry level, but far from top of the line.  It does what we need it to do, which is a mix of multimedia creation and work-related tasks of all sorts.It wasn't that it was running slow, but it was getting bogged down with various tasks and I wanted to see if I could somehow clear up the bottleneck.This SSD really does the trick.  It's very specific in speeding up the programs you use the most, which is where I generally notice slowdowns.Easy to install.  Goes right into an open hard-drive slot.  If you're at all comfortable with installing components, this is a breeze.  Low power usage, which is something I'm concerned about as I've had other components push me past my power limits (and I wasn't quite ready to upgrade that).Really, this is a great way to upgrade older systems, and even for newer systems it addresses very particular issues that even upgrading other parts might not address.In short, easy to install, works without having to pay attention to it, and provides noticeably faster load times for programs and for the computer as a whole. Really helpful.

But, the full-size Tango dock is simply too large to set on my bedside table.  The portable dock is small enough to fit under a lamp without dislodging my clock.Like my full-size dock, this little dock provides amazing sound. I'm delighted at the improvements in sound since my old "hi-fi" system appeared in what my children call "the olden days."  Now we have systems that are very small with sound that is very good.  Sweet!This dock is powered by your audio device, in my case an ipod.  This means that I can take this little dock where ever I want, just have to be aware of the power level of the ipod.OVERALL:Sounds great!  Easily portable!

$REVIEW.: why don't hd manufacturers understand that we don't want your awful bloatware preinstalled on our shiny new hard drives


 make it downloadable with an in-box voucher or something but STOP SHOVING IT DOWN OUR THROATS
 it SUCKS and NOT EVERYBODY WANTS IT

so no 5 stars for you!  if you don't want it, cancel all attempted install prompts, open up the drive when it pops up in the finder/windows explorer, and DELETE!with that bit of nastiness out of the way, this is a perfectly fine external drive


it works quietly for now, but that may change some with age
 from my very unscientific gut sense, it's write speeds are comparable to my 1tb wd my passport


 i will say the drive does not feel as solid as my passport
 maybe it's because it's not packed quite as tightly as the passport (the passport is slightly smaller)


 a minor quibble to say the least
 it won't be moving a whole lot as it's a backup to a backup so it doesn't have to be built like a tank.other than the nonsense software which i will have none of, it's been a perfectly capable drive thus far.

$REVIEW.: Just got this in today. First thing I did was load Shibby's tomatousb firmware. Yes...it has support for 3rd party firmware. Both 2.4ghz and 5ghz works! The range is a lot better than my asus rt-n16 that it replace using toastman's tomato firmware.

$review_text.: I ordered two of the four gig micro memory cards

 I have had problems with micro cards before and was a little leary, but I had to have two of the cards

 I received them quickly...before the posted delivery date
 They work wonderfully and the price is a good one


I would have expected to pay twice as much for each card

 I am very pleased with the cards and sellers promptness.

$review_text.: I'd been looking for a tester for a while and when I found this it was a no-brainer because it really does a lot for little money. It's not a spendy high-end tester but for what we need it's just perfect as it does a bunch of things. I mostly like that it's rechargeable, that it powers 12VDC cameras so you can power/view a cam while on the ladder. It's been reliable so far; and it comes with a protective case, and a nice bag so it won't get smashed in the toolbox.
$SUMMARY.: Much needed CCTV tool for not much money ..

$review_text.: At first, i was wondering if this laptop would not be fast enough to handle what i needed to do.I ordered this laptop to be able to surf the web, some music, youtube, and light gaming ( older games ).This laptop exceeded my expectations. It has a Duel-Core 1.6Ghz procceser, which is a step down from my desktop's 2.8Ghz Dual core... Yet, this laptop is still very responsive. If your hoping to be able to play any current games on this laptop, then no.Honestly, to tell the truth, nobody should be consider a laptop for the main purpose of "gaming" , if you want to game, stick with a desktop computer, or a console.I was able to play Call of Duty 4 with medium-low settings and the fps was good. Don't know about other games, will try left for dead 2 later.The screen is beautiful. Everything is easy to see, and very crisp.One of the first things i noticed when i unboxed the laptop was how light it was. This thing is very easy to bring around with you... The screen size is a good size also.The only complaints i have of this laptop is that..1. I can tell it is made out of some cheap material... That is obviously a downside...2. Their is only 1 speaker. The quality is still good, but a 2nd speaker sounds like it should be standard.Overall, you cant go wrong with this laptop, the price is amazing, and you get more then what you pay for.Pros:________________________Amazing pricegood , hd screenlightweightfast ( for the price )good air ventilation ( doesn't get warm )good battery life ( around 5 hours normal use )cons:___________________________Cheap material ( seems like it in multiple areas: keyboard, touchpad, exterior feelLack of HDD space ( 250gb ). 320gb would be nice(minor), cd tray feels like it could break easily...if i could, i would rate this laptop 4.5/5 stars.If you want a fast laptop, and are on a budget, this is the way to go.

$REVIEW.: I have a very confined 30" deep niche I needed to "float" my plasma TV in.  The TV had to come out to the very edge of the niche, the full 30" from the back.  The niche is exactly as wide as my TV, I mean EXACTLY.  I was worried I couldn't find a mount flexible enough to let me position and height and depth of the TV to the extreme accuracy I needed, including being able to get behind it to connect everything when I was done mounting.  But 33" turned out to be the perfect mount of extension and I was able to pivot the TV just right to access everything behind it, while still maintaining all the other tolerances around my niche.  In the end, all I needed to adjust was the bracket height on the back of the TV to get the height exactly where I needed it, again talking quarters of an inch in tolerance.Keep in mind, this mount does NOT move up and down by itself.  Only the bracket on the back of the TV lets you move it up and down.  If you don't have to worry about tolerances then even better.  Best Buy offered a similar mount for an astounding $600+ dollars, plus they would come out for an additional $125 and do the mounting if i wanted.  Are you kidding me?  So I just saved a boat load of money.As others have pointed out, thought, the instruction are pretty poor; there's a lot of "Engrish" in them.  I actually mounted the mount upside down because it was so unclear, but at least I noticed the problem before trying to mount the TV.  So while it took me longer than I expected to mount, it still came out just fine, and seems extremely sturdy.  I had a stud finder so I knew exactly where to drill.  In my situation where the tolerances were so tight, let me tell you it PAYS to measure, measure, and measure again before drilling any holes.  I got it right on the first try, which amazed me, but I spent a long time measuring and doing the math beforehand.  Those mounting bolts are huge and you do not want to go around make holes that size all over the place, trust me.So, great mount for a great price, if you have the patience to deal with below average instructions.  I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the instructions.
$SUMMARY.: Perfect mount, Best Buy wanted $600 (LOL)

$REVIEW.: I personally own the m4a88td-v instead of the -m, but there isn't one here on amazon.  The differences are -v is full ATX, has 128mb sideport memory for the integrated Radeon HD 4250, 2 extra pci slots, 8 pin CPU connector, sb850 southbridge (better raid options) and sata 3.  Otherwise, they're identical.  I bought mine in May '11 and it's my primary computer.  I started 1 year earlier with a P4 and ubuntu 8.04.  This board spent most of it's life so far running ubuntu 10.10, then 11.10 and a few other OS's.Pros:CheapExcellent bios that makes it really easy for newbs to overclock without starting a fireIntegrated graphics support dual monitors (extended desktop)  *1*316gb DDR3 1333 (possibly better if you know what you're doing)Core unlocker  *2asus tech support is top notch (I tend to 'break' stuff a lot)usb 3.0  *3Cons:No sata3 -- On my full atx version, I have both sata2 and sata3 hard drives, and I do notice a mild speed difference.dvi is dvi-i and lacks a sound explanation in the manual  *1No open usb 3.0 header (if you have a case with usb 3.0 front ports) *3Lacks some of the raw power, snazzy features, and potential video output of high-end boards (--that cost several hundred dollars more)Notes:*1 The board has 3 video ports and can support extended desktop or dual monitor of multi-headed display or whatever you want to call it, provided you meet the correct conditions.The board has 3 video ports--VGA-- blue plug, basic analog signal, also called D-Sub or HD15-DVI-D-- A member of the DVI family (white plug) which does not support analog.  It does support dual link DVI via a y-connector, but I haven't tested it.-HDMI-- Performance seems to vary from OS to OS.  From best to worst that I've tried: Fedora 16, Windows 7, Ubuntu 11.10It's important to note that if you try to connect either the DVI-D or HDMI to a vga adapter, it won't work.If you look at the DVI-D port, there are three rows of pins with a paddle shaped pin off to the side.  In other DVI types, this paddle is surrounded by 4 pins that carry an analog signal.  Since those 4 pins are missing, you need a converter, not an adapter.  Don't buy something like thisCablesToBuyTM DVI-D Male to HD15 Female Adapterit simply won't work.  There's no analog signal, only a dual digital signal.  I also wouldn't advise trying to get a fancy converter either as it would be more economical at that point to get a different video card or a different monitor.Likewise, HDMI to VGA cables are available, but they won't work.  They are intended for the rare HDMI device that has pass-through analog support (the board SHOULD support audio via HDMI, but I haven't tested it).  Either way, you can't use the integrated graphics to output to two vga monitors.  I have tested it with 1 VGA and 1 DVI as well as 1 VGA and 1 HDMI.  Both work in all 3 OS's mentioned, but are sometimes buggy with HDMI (possibly user error).  I haven't tested HDMI and DVI-D, but the manual says it shouldn't work.*2 I bought a phenom II 555 (close to this but for $90AMD Phenom II X2 560 Processor, Black Edition (HDZ560WFGMBOX)) in the hopes of getting a cheap processor with latent cores that I could unlock.  If you plan to buy any processor that 'can' unlock, just remember that doesn't mean it 'will' unlock and you don't get your money back if it doesn't.  In my case, I bought a dual that had a chance to unlock to a quad.  My 3rd core was bad, but the 4th was good.  When I tried the auto-unlocker, it didn't work.  A month later, I figured out how to go to the cpu settings in bios and tell it to unlock the 4th core but leave the 3rd locked.  2 points asus for having that feature at all.*3 The board comes with a driver disk.  In linux, nothing on it works, but all of the components (usb3, ethernet, audio, graphics, etc) are recognized and have open source drivers.  You can download Catalyst Control Center (which I hate but advise) for better dual monitor control, but it should be recognized by default.In windows 7 (an older disk without the asus driver CD) it can only support 1 display at limited resoultion, can't see it's ethernet, usb 3.0 etc.  Fortunately, the asus DVD installs the driver and a bunch of nifty overclocking/tweaking features (be careful and use babysteps, if you don't you could find out what burning processor smells like) that totally don't work in linux (at least without substantial effort).A note on RAM:To max out the board, you need 2 sets of dual 4gb sticks at 1333 (or better if you know what you're doing).  I went with a single set of GSkill Ripjaw 2x4gb 1333 and it's always been far more than enough.Notable Windows Experience Index results:  --I've only dabbled in Windows 7 while learning about multibooting, but I know my way around well enough.Processor: 7.1 (modestly overclocked and unlocked from 3.2 dual core to 3.7 triple core)Ram:  7.5Aero Graphics: 4.5 (without overclocking GPU, 4.6 with a gentle nudge from 900mhz to 950mhz in the ASUS Turbo-V utility)Gaming Graphics:  5.7  I have no ides why this is better that Aero.  Mind you, I do have the 128mb sideport memory that isn't available on the -m model that this review is for.A little fooling around with the ASUS tools and those numbers should climb.Summary:Buy this board if you're a computer enthusiast or gamer on a budget.  You won't be displeased.
$SUMMARY.: The budget board that preforms like an enthusiast board

$REVIEW.: From reading the specification on the box and what all I could have done with this


I now know that Seagate delivered false promises on this product
The concept is very good but not well thought of as far as workability.Bought this from Best Buy not from Amazon.At first I hooked it up to my router by following the crappy one page installation guide
After that I was on my own
The dashboard software did not once install on my Windows 7 64 bit system
I ended up with nothing but errors


After restarting the system several times and trying to reinstall the software, I turned to the web


Nothing on Seagate's website pointed to the installation of their dashboard software


Now whenever I restart my computer the dashboard software detects the drive and asks if I want to download the latest version of the dashboard


At first I clicked yes but to my surprise the updated version started the installation process and then hung


To tell you the truth I don't think you need the software unless you want to do back up on your systems


Good luck if you get it to install.I eventually gave up and came back to it a second day with some luck
After tickering with it, I managed to access the drive and install the software from the drive itself, not the CDROM, by right clicking on the drive and selecting properties

There is a hidden link that takes you to the admin page

This allowed me to set up the drive and users on with passwords.One thing that happened is that the drive is now visible on my computer via my LAN and wifi connection


I now have an X, Y and Z drive to throw my files to and the transfer speed is really fast

I have not tried the other features Seagate has claimed this product is capable of.If you are looking for a good NAS that is easy to install, don't buy this one


Support is limited and the installation instruction is sketchy

They have left us out here on a limb to figure it out for ourselves.You can see the drive under network or network devices on Windows 8 OS but you won't be able to save to it even if you log in with the admin or any other user log in account

Dashboard does not support windows 8 and will give you an error if you try to install.

$REVIEW.: Purchased this center channel after weeks of research.  This was not going in my main viewing area so my #1 concern was value.  I stumbled across this CS20 and read the reviews and I figured I would give it a try.  I've had it for over a week and I'm very impressed.  It's not my first experience with Polk but it's been a very long time.  I'm very glad I made this purchase.  The sound is very good, very clean, and plenty loud.Only drawback is this thing is large.  If you are putting on stand then it's no big deal but if you plan on mounting think twice.  You have to remember though with size comes better sound.I might have tried the CS10 first but since I ordered the CS20 instead I'm just going to keep it.If size is not your concern don't hesitate to buy this center channel.  It's excellent.  I knocked it one star just because of the size, it's no reflection on the actual sound.I just ordered a pair of Polk TSI300's to pair up with this thing.  I expect them to be just as good.

$REVIEW.: This is my first medium-plus-sized flat-screen TV purchase (unlike my early-adopter friends, who rushed to spend $4+ figures on the first-generation 720p plasma flat-screens a few years ago, I was content to wait patiently until 1080p became available in the mid-3 figure price range, which is now), and overall I have to say I'm pretty satisfied.As a first-time LCD-TV buyer, I can say little about how the picture quality stacks up against other new LCDs (but friends who know better than I tell me it's "decent", if not spectacular); but it is, of course, a big jump up from the CRT I had been watching prior (and for which I paid about the same amount, 15 years ago!).So far, after a couple months of use, I can say:PROs: excellent value for money, decent build quality (no "dead" pixels I can see, which I was worried there might be), a great step up from a CRT TV (if you're one of the few people left doing that), pretty good ATSC reception (pulls in some pretty weak TV channels my ATSC converter box generally didn't), good connectivity options (very happy with the 3xHDMI and 2xComponent inputs, but the single Composite video input necessitated a composite input switchbox, which was cheap to add).CONs: No-frills exterior (any finish you like, so long as it's gloss-black plastic), power-on takes a couple of seconds (or maybe, all flat-sceen TVs do?) during which TV briefly makes some odd popping and clicking noises (not loudly, but in a quiet room you do notice), channel memory occasionally "forgets" settings (so that channels you wanted skipped, unskip themselves from time to time), IR remote sensor tucked into lower RH corner (so if TV is set in a cabinet, remote is blocked from the entire RH side of the room - unlike TVs with center-placed IR sensors, which can pick up remote commands so long as you can still see the screen), remote codes not well covered by aftermarket remotes (you're fine if you use a "learning" aftermarket remote control, but it would have been nice if this brand was popular enough for aftermarket remotes to have its control codes as presets).Overall, if this is not a great TV, it's not a bad one at all; and for someone (like myself) finally upgrading from that old CRT, you really can't beat it's value-for-dollar price at this point (so far as I can tell). So far, I'm a pretty satisfied customer; and odds are if buyers don't expect too much from this TV, I would think most people would be as well.UPDATE: After reading mention from another reviewer here, that ProScan is related to RCA (how exactly, I didn't quite catch), I thought I'd report that some aftermarket universal remotes *can* be programmed to control this TV without having to be "trained" to do so, using preset codes for "RCA" model TVs. I've discovered this is true, for both Philips and GE universal (NON-"learning") remotes. Note that none of the listed "ProScan" control codes work, but one or two of the codes under the "RCA" brand DO work. So, if you're one of the folks who like consolidating all your devices onto one universal remote for everyday use, I can report this TV can be used with them also, just so long as you try TV control codes for "RCA"-brand TVs. I hope someone else out there can use this tip.

$REVIEW.: I use this to hook my iphone up in my car.it's a no frills cable.retractor works as you'd expect.the cable is thin, so doesn't take up too much space.works as well as i'd expect.i'd recommend this product.2/18/14 update (have had this for 5 months):well, this was pretty good for a while, but it has now failed. the cable has split near one of the heads.so i'm going to have to say poor construction, taking away one star for lack of durability.i don't feel that i'm particularly harsh with it

$REVIEW.: I had NO idea how badly I needed this thing until I got it.  Its perfect!  It fits in my purse and I got a super industrial strength cover with keyboard for it, so its like a mini laptop.  I can do everything with all the free apps.  It makes shopping easier and better (and I save tons of money, thanks red laser), writing down my thoughts, recording a music riff, taking pics and videos, there is not much this little wonder can't do!  Thats why I sprung for the one with a huge memory, hopefully if I take care of it Ill have it a very very very long time and get the most out of it.  The battery also lasts a long long time too and it always finds wifi to connect to so I am hardly ever without service (and I don't have to pay for a plan!!)  I love you Apple!

The 3 colors make it easy to keep track of everyone's cases (great for the children :) ).The cords stay neatly coiled and it is easy to unwind them when you want to use the earbuds.They seem pretty durable and for the price, I won't mind replacing them if they wear out.They are easy to toss in a purse, backpack or pocket, and the small mesh pocket inside is very handy for memory cards, game cards etc..If you have an iPod shuffle, it will probably fit right inside the case, too.I had previously paid $6 for just one case, so this price is perfect!

$REVIEW.: The revision A and B of this product is defective; revision A/B has two antennas, this revision cannot be updated to the latest firmware and has physical defects which make it operate at sub-par performance, not even a fourth of what was advertised. This is a fact and can be found on d-link's website. If you buy this, dont be sucked in by the revision A/B's two antennas, and larger packaging. Get the revision C which has one antenna, and smaller packaging. I am a victim of this trap.*** Update ***- At the time of this reviews writing I worked for D-Link, now I do not.

$REVIEW.: This is a great PS, but it has a few problems that need to be recognized:CONS:HIGH PITCHED WHINE - as described in previous reviews, this is a real phenomenon.  When I first started my new system (i7-3770, Asus z77 MB using on chip graphics) the high pitched whine was overwhelmingly obvious and constant. It doesn't come from the PS itself, but rather from somewhere around the monitor (powering off the monitor made it go away).  Fortunately for me the situation improved greatly once I installed the updated Intel HD Graphics Driver. Now I only hear the whine for brief seconds during startup and shutdown when my monitor is changing resolution in the "auto-adjust" mode. And here's the kicker - this is a second computer sharing the same monitor.  If my other computer is powered on and sending a video signal to the monitor (regardless if it is the selected channel or not), the whine is completely eliminated!  Obviously this is some kind of weird RF resonance/feedback issue. I'm just glad it's not a big deal for me or I don't need to troubleshoot it. If it were continuous, I would RMA this PS in a heartbeat like the other guys (and give it one star). The noise is that bad!OVER PACKAGING - also mentioned in other reviews, the over-packaging on this PS is so over-the-top as to be just plain silly! Why I need a PS shipped to me in a fancy felt bag with its own draw-string and a gold label is beyond me.  And while this is largely a trivial issue, if all of this fancy packaging in any way contributes to the already substantial price of this unit, then it is a problem.  Seasonic should simply take a lesson from Amazon's "frustration free packaging" and ship this to me in a plain cardboard box - that I will end up throwing away anyway!PRO:THIS IS AN AMAZING PS! Solid construction, dead silent from what I can tell, and doesn't even seem to get warm to the touch. Since I also have a virtually silent CPU Cooler, and no noisy GPU fan to deal with, the only noise emanating from my computer now is a couple of chassis fans, which will be my next target for noise reduction.BOTTOM LINE - if one is lucky enough to dodge the High Pitched Whine of Death bullet, and one isn't concerned with saving the Rain Forests by reducing needless packaging, then this is the PS to get if noise reduction is a primary consideration.
$review_summary.: An Awesome PS - IF you get lucky!

$REVIEW.: When I first heard about these and their "small ecological print", I thought to myself: "aww, nice marketing trick" and I was quite sceptical about how good the sound would be. Some people kept talking about them on the audio forums and reported that Rain are clear, detailed and very well balanced phones with liquid midrange. At this time I was looking for smooth full midrange so I finally decided to try them out and I am very impressed with them, especially at their price point (I paid slightly under $60 for mine). They sounded great straight out of the box even without any burn in. Bass is present and is of very good quality (make sure you are achieving the proper seal), midrange is indeed buttery liquid, vocals are smooth and, perhaps, ever so slightly forward, which exactly what I wanted (I have tried quite a few IEMs under $120 which suffer from the recessed mids). Treble is also awesome, present, but not harsh, does not pull all the attention to itself - it is well balanced with the rest of the sound spectrum. Soundstage is not large, but it's not small either, and it is very engaging. Clarity, instrument separation and detail are great. Acoustic music sounds beyond good, but they are great with a variety of styles. I thought they'd be really laid back phones, and they are relaxed, but somehow they still manage to possess quite enough energy for my drum based tracks. They should work well for lengthy listening sessions as they are not fatiguing. Microphonics, another big concern of mine (I hate cord noise), are great here too (meaning  there is very little) and the included shirt clip takes care of whatever little cord noise there might be.Update: After the initial excitement I noticed within the first day of use that one side is distorting at medium volume levels. I really loved the sound signature of these, hopefully the exchange will go ok.Update2: Got the replacement I've been impatiently waiting for. So far everything is great. These are becoming my favorite portable phones.Update3: It's really worth it to get some Comply foam tips for these (t400 or the skullcandy size works fine). The sound becomes even more impressive.(other headphones I've own/ed include: Grado SR325i, Sennheiser HD600, Fischer Audio DBA-02, Silver Bullet and Eterna, Ultimate Ears Super.Fi 5 and 4, RE0, Sony MDR-EX90, Apple in Ear Dual Driver, Meelec M11+, M6 and M9, Zune premium in ear v2)

$REVIEW.: It works and does what it claims. I even bought a cheap Type II CF SDHC adapter and it worked in my Nikon D300.It's a bit fiddly in terms of its power management as far as the Wi-Fi going to sleep when it thinks nothing is going on, and as many have pointed out you don't really have much control over what it does and it's pretty much an all-or-nothing deal.With even mid-range point-and-shoot cameras giving you options like HDR and even RAW in some cases, not to mention eveything you can do on a prosumer or pro camera these days, just having the mobi dump everything over WiFi will often be more than what you want.They really need the ability to ignore (or only transfer) certain file types so that you could, say, have .jpg files sent but .raw files simply retained on the mobi for later extraction.It is pretty cool to be able to have your camera wirelessly linked to your phone as you shoot, and the fact that you can actually get all this functionality into an SD form-factor is still amazing, but for me this implementation is still mostly a gimmick. But I'm not really part of the "let's post our pictures to Facebook ten seconds after we take them" generation :)G.
$SUMMARY.: It works, not really all that useful in many cases

$REVIEW.: Just received it today. Plugged in, easy bios setup - 2 minutes. Everything up and running.Pros:1) Build quality is very good. Very sturdy well-built construction.2) Works at 1866MHz@1.5v - tested.3) WEI = 7.9 for 8GB of memory.Cons:1) huge (could barely fit it on myEVGA Z68 SLI MOBOunderZALMAN CoolerHeatpipe2) Corsair tech support wasn't knowledgeable about their own product. The guy misinformed me on voltage and I asked him twice "are you sure?", he said 100% it's 1.65v ... luckily I have done enough research and called them back and confirmed that it's indeed 1.5v. But I'm still happy the customer support wasn't in India.This was a replacement forG.Skill Ripjawswhich I just sent back after figuring out that those sticks only work on 1600MHz@1.5v despite specs and product description everywhere. They are in fact cheap 1333MHz chips that are already overclocked to 1600MHz and then they offer to overclock them more raising the voltage. Very poor quality compared to this product which is 50% more expensive, but it worth it.Also, I have ordered this product from Amazon and strongly recommend everyone to buy products only from Amazon, LLC. This way you can be sure about a quality of product AND service. Returns are always easy and price is at its lowest. Also have to mention great shipping prices and options available when buying from Amazon LLC.I'm a Prime member and I love Amazon :)UPDATE-------------------------------------------Have been using it for several month by now.

$review_text.: When I ordered Crucial M4 solid state drives to upgrade two Acer Aspire Revo R3700 PCs, I didn't realize a version that includes a data transfer cable was available, so had a sudden need for one. This Anker converter worked perfectly for the purpose, via Acronis True Image 2013's Disk Cloning tool. (The Acronis software is a separate purchaseTrue Image 2013. A 30 day trial version is available from Acronis, but the clone tool is disabled in that version.)I particularly liked the inclusion of a power supply wall plug and cable, rather than the two-headed USB cable on some alternative drive adapters. And if I ever again want to see anything on either of the two original Hitachi Travelstar 5K500.B hard drives, either can easily be connected to this adapter and seen as a USB drive on a PC.All it lacks is an activity light.

$review_text.: I'm a huge picture taker and have really been doing more and more video especially HD. I thought it would be great to review this Canon compared to the Samsung I got a year agoSamsung SC-HMX20C 8GB High Definition Camcorder with 10x Optical Zoomwhich is almost the same.First off, the Canon is a bit bulkier looking and not as streamlined like the Samsung. Visually the Samsung is designed much better and nicer. The canon has a lot of buttons and knobs everywhere on the camera where the Samsung has them pretty much on the back of it. Canon has those rubber flip ports to put the AC plug and the HDMI and usb are under a plastic flap on the side under the hand strap. The Samsung has a little door that slides up for the usb and component on the side with the LCD screen but to use the HDMI you have to put the camera on the docking cradle that can also be used for charging and usb/component.The Canon has an external battery that can be upgraded to an extended output where as the Samsung has a built in battery. The battery lasted longer in the Samsung for recording and also unused storage. Canon takes longer to charge up too.The lens on the Canon is huge and the auto lens cover is a bit cheap and make a rattle noise when you shake the camera a little. Its probably the cheapest thing on the camera. Holding the camera, the Canon is light weight and feels comfortable where as the Samsung is a bit heavier and the placement of the zoom is a bit more difficult to work. The Samsung seems to be geared for smaller hands where as the Canon fits perfectly in my hands. I did feel that the Canon felt a little cheaper, maybe it is because of the lighter weight?The canon uses a knob to select video or photo where the Samsung has a button that u press. Canon has an 8mp camera built in and Samsung 4mp but the Canon wins in quality of still photos, they were really good, vibrant and sharp. The Canon comes with 32gb of internal memory where the Samsung is only 8. They both handle 1080 HD but the overall picture quality was better on the Canon. Both have a slot for an additional SD memory card.Samsung has a great touch screen LCD 2.7 inch and is sharp, the canon also has a 2.7 inch but no touch screen but uses a few buttons and one of those up down left right knob/buttons, bummer that there isn't a touch screen, so you have to scroll thru menus to select and get around which takes longer. Sharpness of screen on Canon was better but looked a bit blue in color where the Samsung was better tone wise but visibly softer.Canon has a lot of other features like 24p cinema mode settings and a hot shoe to add accessories like a video light, mic. You can also get converter lenses for it. The Canon also has the capability of taking still snapshots while recording video with no pause, Samsung can't. The startup of the Canon was a bit faster. The power button on the Canon is a button but its in a weird spot on the top of the camera on the other side of the rest of the buttons where the Samsung has all the buttons in one general area on the back.The zoom, both optical and digital are better on the Canon. Both have 10x optical, Canon can do 200x digital, Samsung 100x. My favorite part... image stabilization... the Canon wins hands down even at max 200x zoom was solid! I was super impressed that an image stabilizer on a video camera finally works like it should. The Samsung image stabilization is horrible and i mean bad! Even using software to fix the motion didn't help.Included in the box for the Canon is manual, software disc, battery, ac adapter, remote, stereo, usb cable and component cable. Samsung - docking cradle, manual, software, ac adapter, remote, usb, component, stereo cables. pretty much the same stuff...no HDMI or neck straps.My final opinion is that the Canon is a much better camera but at a huge price tag. The Samsung is really good but minor flaws makes it fall short but the price for the Samsung is less than half the price of the Canon so if price is a factor get the Samsung but if you want the best video and features then get the Canon. (Samsung is replacing the HMX20 model soon with a newer version)

$review_text.: While I don't believe I will be cutting the ties with cable tv service anytime soon, I am interested in the various streaming media players on the market that extend your home's multimedia experience.My first such device was my Series 2 TiVo DVRs. Back then, TiVo was ahead of its time by incorporating multimedia options with the core DVR. You could stream Netflix, download movies from Blockbuster and Amazon, watch YouTube and more. TiVo's offerings in this area haven't improved much with the Premiere editions since the Series 2 devices. Chiefly, they don't have the ability to stream Amazon Prime videos, something I like to do. This is the main reason I finally purchased Roku boxes, which I've been very happy with.Having had such a great experience with Roku, I was very interested to see what Western Digital had to offer with their WD TV Play Media Player. As with its competitors, this box was easy to set up using an HD cable. It can also be attached using RCA cables, which are provided in the box.Once I had the Western Digital box configured, I quickly noticed one glaring omission in offerings - no Amazon channel. Not only can you not stream Amazon Prime videos with this device, but you can't even download purchased and rented videos from Amazon. With Amazon such a big player in this market, I'm frankly stunned to see this not included from the beginning.They do have several of the other usual suspects - Netflix, Hulu, and a few others but nothing very different from its competitors.The device can play in 1080p resolution, which will please most HD TV owners. The picture looks great on my television, using a wireless network connection and Comcast internet service.While the Western Digital TV Media Player works fine, it just isn't a very competitive box - there isn't anything that sets it apart from the rest of the pack, as far as I am concerned. I'd highly recommend a Roku instead of the Western Digital if you are looking for something with more options and more growth potential. However, if you just want this box to use with Netflix or Hulu, it should work fine for you.
$SUMMARY.: Works OK for what it does but isn't very competitive in feature set

$REVIEW.: These  are a 1,000% improvement on my old stock speakers!  The price was cheaper than some crummy Walmart off brand name that I'd never heard of before.  Hooked to a Kenwood 4x50 deck, there is lots of bass (too much, actually, I've got rattles in the doors I didn't know about before...) and the midrange and tweeters are giving me sound I hear on the home stereo, but not in the car before.  Highly recommended, although for my 1998 Ford Contour SE, I did have to drill holes for one set of the speaker holes.

Unrelated to the reviewed adapter, but to the subject of meter reading capture, Radio Shack's ScopeView utility did not cooperate on installing and running on Windows 7. So I modified a circa-2002 MSDN serial example (NetSerialComm) to have the required features to support data capture to file.

$REVIEW.: OK First of all this does work for a 2008 Honda civic EX 2-door coupe with the premium sound system, (w/o navigation)replaced by a JVC double din receiver  When you get this unit make sure you do a comparative analysis of the wiring instructions provided by AXXESS vs. that of you car manufacturer.  If you go to the parts department or the service guys of your car manufacturer, they will most likely give you the pin-outs for the radio/control plugs you need to invade to make this work.  Be wary of information on the web...  It turns out that the plug diagram given was backwards for my car and it was corrected with a quick chat to the service dept.  in other words the diagram you download from the AXXESS sit compared to what they list in words is different.  As for the functionality, it works just like the original system.  One thing, if you disconnect the battery I found it best to click the reset button and start over

The picture quality is fantastic as it up scales standard DVD's to 1080p and the audio is Dolby digital.

$review_text.: Good protection, went on quick and simple

I like the 2 layers that protect the actual shield
Its very difficult to scratch the shield during install
cutouts are all in the right spot.One suggestion; put the pull tabs at the bottom of shield
Right now, the tabs are at the top so you need to start install at top
There is no easy reference on top


On the bottom, there is a big button
Aligning the shield over that button assures the rest will align as well.

$review_text.: This has been my go-to remote release with a Canon 5D II for over three years

It's dead reliable out to at least a hundred yards and doesn't have any sort of directional limitation as with infrared triggers

I don't think I've ever replaced the battery in either component

The receiver fits securely in the flash shoe and the build and cable quality leaves little to be desired


The only reason you might consider something else is if you wanted an intervalometer to take an automated picture series


Those come in wired and wireless styles

The wireless kind (starting at around $30) duplicates the functionality of this unit.

$REVIEW.: I've applied screen protectors to an embarrassingly large number of devices over the past 8 years or so:  iPhones, iPod touches, iPads, Droids, and others.  I've almost always opted for the more expensive brands, figuring "you get what you pay for" and figuring that my precious expensive gadgets deserve the best protection.Since the iPad Air is so new (it's been out 5 days, I've had mine 3 days), my preferred brands of screen protectors aren't available yet for it.  So I thought I'd try these iSmooth protectors.  They've received excellent reviews, and they're cheap enough that I won't feel bad if I don't like them and have to replace them.But guess what?  I LOVE them.  They are JUST AS GOOD AS the more expensive brands.  They aren't super easy to apply--none of these are, especially for a large-screen device.  But I watched the installation video at iSmooth's website--it is excellent and a must-watch before installing.  And 15 minutes later, I had a nearly perfect installation.I *never* have a PERFECT installation with these things--there are always 1 or 2 dust bubbles I can't get out, or the screen film is not PERFECTLY positioned.  But I end up settling for "good enough" rather than "perfect" because trying to remove a dust bubble or reposition the film by lifting it up can easily allow more dust particles in.  It is really hard for me to get it "perfect," and I can easily live with "good enough."I would say my installation of the iSmooth film is as close to perfect as I've ever achieved.  The film is not quite perfectly positioned.  The space between the right edge of the film and the right edge of my iPad is just slightly bigger than the space between the left edge of the film and the left edge of the iPad; and the hole for the home button is not perfectly centered around the button.  But this is really hard to notice if you're not looking for it.  Importantly, I was able to push out all the bubbles without having to lift the film and use tape.What about the look and feel of the iSmooth film?  It is crystal clear - you can't tell it's on.  There is no prism effect.  It does NOT diminish the resolution of the beautiful retina display.  It is really hard to tell that you have a screen protector on the device.It feels smooth as glass as you glide your finger across the screen.  When you first install it, it feels slightly friction-y.  This has something to do with the film not having access to oxygen while it's in the packaging.  This goes away in an hour and then the film feels like the glass it's protecting.Yes, as you use your iPad, the film collects fingerprints--just as the iPad itself would if you had no screen film on it.  You can easily wipe them off, though, with the included microfiber cloth or any lens cleaning wipes, and then the iSmooth screen film again looks flawless.Yes, the film has a glossy appearance which is reflective.  But so is the iPad's bare display.  You can get other screen films that reduce the glare and reflection, but these add a prism effect or otherwise interfere with the clarity and resolution of the display.  I'd much rather deal with the glossiness and reflection (which is the same as if you used no screen protector at all).  But that is a matter of personal preference, I guess.The packaging includes a good medium-sized microfiber cloth for wiping down your iPad screen before applying the film.  It includes several pieces of dust-removal tape (which I happily did not have to use).  And best of all, it includes TWO screen protectors in case you screw one up during the installation.  I didn't, so I'll have the second one in case my first one ever gets scratches.Finally, iSmooth stands behind their product and has good support and a liberal replacement policy.This is a LOT of benefits for a screen protector that is much less expensive than the big-name brands like Zagg and PowerSupport and 3M.I highly, highly recommend this iSmooth film.  The expensive films are no better, just more expensive. I'm a convert.(p.s. - I have absolutely no relationship with iSmooth and no personal interest in their success or failure as a company - I am recommending this to you ONLY because I think it's a great product at a great price.)
$SUMMARY.: Excellent, just as good as the more expensive ones

I am not a fan of Cyberlink POWERDVD, which is the bundle softwareOther thoughts:From another accredited online electronics retailer (Newegg), there is a high rate (15%) of complains about this model failing to read and burn Blu-Ray discs. Normally, as for Sept 2012, a Blu-Ray RW Drive costs way above a hundred bucks, and this drive is on the same price range as other brand's Blu-Ray ROM ONLY drives. Personally, I bought this drive with the mindset of expecting Blu-Ray-oriented failures.So far, I've not yet tried any Blu-Ray playback nor burning. For DVD and CD functions, however, it has given satisfactory results. I will update my review in the future after using it for Blu-Ray Discs, which I hasn't ever used in my life -- yet.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this player as a replacement because I clumsily killed my Toshiba SD-P1900 9" player
I figured, even with a half-inch loss of screen size, I'd still be in the game, right?  Panasonic's a great brand name, right? WRONG.This particular Panasonic model not only has lousy picture quality and no remote, but there are no fast forward or fast rewind functions other than skipping all the way ahead or all the way back to the beginnings of scenes
I'm a film buff, so I like to be able to back up two or three seconds to check out that explosion in fps detail, or to move forward or backward at 2X or 4X or 8X, etc

Plus, if you extend the adjustable screen forward as shown in most illustrations, you cannot see or reach the control buttons without moving it out of your way.I'm no video product engineer, but I hope my impression of the VERY inadequate picture quality and overall poor design of this player makes you think twice

 Go for the Toshiba instead!

$review_text.: First, I admit that I had a little trouble setting this device up - the WPS (aka quick connect) didn't work after several tries, so I gave up in that
I attempted the manual setup next, and while the instructions made it seem complicated it really wasn't, once I figured out that I needed to hold the wireless setup button down closer to 8 second than the 5 suggested by the directions


Once the light goes blinking yellow-green though, it took just a minute to set it up.Once connected to the home wifi, this acts as a wireless speaker for either your iPhone or iPad, or for your home PC running iTunes

Multiple units can be added to the network - for instance one in each room, for having music play in every room at the same time, and Apple TV and Airport Express work with the same AirPlay system as well

In my particular setup, I had a PC upstairs, an Apple TV downstairs in the living room (hooked up to the home thater) and this Fidelio device in the kitchen
All devices could be set to play the same music using either the PC or using and iPhone with the Remote app to control all three devices, with the option to turn each one on or off and control the volume independently from the iPhone
Unlike higher end wireless home stereo systems, different music cannot be played independently through each unit though - for that I think you have to use something like theThe unit itself is physically pretty small - not much bigger than a hardcover Harry Potter book

The design is pretty sleek, and it has speakers behind the front grill and subwoofer outlets at the back to give it some nice bass


Around back there are also a few extras like a USB port to let you charge your device, and a 1/8th jack input for non-AirPlay enabled devices (i.e

older iPods, other mp3 players,  phones, etc)


There are four buttons; power, volume up/down, and the wifi connect button

The wifi connect button is probably only ever going to be used once, and the others are going to be used infrequently since the volume control can be handled from an iPhone/iPod via Remote app and AirPlay
On top of the unit is a brushed aluminum cap, which looks handsome but may contribute to wifi reception issues (details later).Overall my setup works pretty well
The music sounds good - not mind-blowing, but very good for a unit this size and its enough to fill a medium sized living room, bedroom or kitchen easily

It is a little heavy on the bass, which does make spoken word programming (radio, podcasts, etc) a little muddled, but it's not too bad


The volume is very loud - I turn it up to just about 1/3 the max on the phone is plenty loud for my living room
The best advantage of this system is realized when you have multiple speakers throughout the house because the sound is synchronized, so moving from room to room it all just sounds like one system, which is pretty amazing


The only fault I can point out with the Fidelio is that the WiFi isnt that strong, so it needs to be placed where it gets good signal
If its in a weak signal area, it will drop in and out, and in doing so cause other devices to also drop in and it as they try to stay synced
If you have good wifi coverage and are not placing this unit far away from your wifi router, it should be fine


If you don't have great wifi coverage, you might want to consider an AirPort Express which acts as a wifi repeater to amplify your signal, and can also be hooked up directly to speakers

But then of course you lose the all-in-one package that this device has, which is its primary selling point.UPDATE: Originally I had purchased this as a gift for my father who wanted music in both the living room and kitchen, and I set it up for that purpose and it worked well
Recently though I noticed that the price had gone down significantly (now around $115 vs $199) so I picked one up for myself as well
I couldn't be happier with the purchase


I might even pick up a couple more for other rooms in the house

At that price, it's hard to pass up.

$REVIEW.: I may add to this review once we actually use these cloths, but right now they are in a stack waiting to be used--partly, I suppose, because it's not yet warm enough that we've been washing our vehicles in the driveway, but also because I haven't come up with something that I want to risk getting dye on.  Both the blue and the yellow cloths faded when I washed them, resulting in the yellow/white/blue cloths turning various shades of green.  I'm really glad that I didn't put other laundry in with them!The cloths are soft and fluffy, and as I said, I may add to this review later to describe their performance.  First, though, I need to find a place where we want them to perform.  Kitchen tasks were mentioned in the item description I read, but I don't think I want dye on anything I'm going to use with food.Update, 5/1/13:My son used these cloths to clean some bikes and trikes recently.  As far as I know, they didn't fade and did a good job on the cleaning.

I had no trouble mounting it to a wall, connecting it to my router (using the enclosed POE adapter), and setting it up within my home network as a WiFi &#34;hotspot&#34;.I designed my house to have ethernet wires behind the walls, going to every room (and 2 wires to some rooms).  This devices solved the problem of a section of the house too far from my wireless router.

I recommend if you want to run a wire instead of wireless.  In my case, I was hooking up a Sony TV to the internet since $ony wanted 60 bucks for their proprietary wireless adapter. No deal.  Thanks for the good cable!

$REVIEW.: I am using this lens with a Panasonic GF-1 and it works great. Despite it being metal, it still is pretty light too. However, when I put it down on a flat surface it tips forward which can be problematic if you are setting up a timer shot. One thing to note on the GF-1 is that if you pull the manual focus ring on the lens, the camera will automatically switch to MF; but, when you turn the focus ring, it does not automatically zoom in for you like it does with other Panasonic lenses. If you go through the menu to switch to MF and keep the focus ring on the 'AF' setting, it will zoom in. Weird. Perhaps a firmware update will clear this up in the future?The Panasonic 14mm f2.5 is similar in focal length and it is also a very good, cheap, and light lens. But the Olympus is excellent. The difference is in the materials, speed, and that small bit of focal length. For what you get, the price difference is appropriate. I took the 12mm on a trip and I think those 2mm can make a big difference in some situations. I never had to back up to get more in the shot. Also, if you got the kit lens with your camera, chances are you have the 14mm focal length covered, albeit at f3.5.The other question is the difference between f2.5 and f2.0. This actually amounts to almost a full f-stop (one full f-stop is f2.0 - f2.8). That won't quite halve your shutter speed, but it certainly comes close. Just some informal tests showed my camera metering the Olympus at 1/100 and the Panasonic at 1/60 shutter speed.Image quality is tough for me to judge. Both lenses produce great, sharp images without noticeable artifact. For more scientific looks at sharpness and chromatic aberration, take a look at dpreview.com.Finally, how can you resist the silver lens? With all these black lenses everybody's making, the silver lens just looks cool. All-in-all its an awesome, quality lens that looks cool and puts out great images.

$review_text.: This is a standard 1/4 wave vehicular roof mount 220 Mhz antenna designed to mount on a NMO Motorola Mount.  I was a Radio Tech for 30+ years and mounted numerous similar antennas.  The quality of this 220 Mhz Laird Antenna is every bit as good as any I've ever mounted.  It's a good antenna.The antenna is cut for the 220 Mhz band, it's SWR is reasonably broad and capable of covering the 222-224 Ham Band as Well as the Commercial 220 Mhz Band.  I'm retired and the only radios I work with now are my Ham Radio units.  I mounted this antenna using an NMO/L-Bracket to the Metal Rain Gutters on my house for use with an Alinco DR-235 1.25 meter radio that functions as a Base Station Radio.  The metal gutter makes a super ground plane and the antenna "hears" like crazy and transmits equally well even on the inexpensive RG-8X Coaxial Cable I'm using.The antenna makes a good "hidden antenna" if you're in a neighborhood zoned community.

If you've never used these style headphones, give it time.  They can be a little tight or uncomfortable at first.  It is totally worth getting used to though.  You will completely block everything else out.  Also, Don't listen to these like you would others.  adjust the volume down or you'll get a little surprise when you first use them.

$REVIEW.: This is not my first Tamron lens, I've had others that I've returned or re-sold after using for a while

 Needless to say I'm not much of a fan


 I don't know what prompted me to try them again, but I'm glad I did

 I was previously using a Sigma 28-70 on an APS-C sensor dSLR

 For routine shooting of family events, the Sigma was a bit too long of a focal length
 I purchased this after considering other lenses made by Canon, Sigma, and Tokina
 I read up on users' opinions of the lenses and decided that the Tamron was so widely loved and seemed to be such good value for the money, I'd give them one last shot.The lens is now the one I shoot with for just about everything

 I have an ultra-wide, a macro, and a tele with IS

 I use each of those ones about 5% each, and this one about 85% of the time.Why did this one change my mind?The build quality is very good
 The image quality is outstanding, with very crisp images even at f/2.8


 Bokeh is lovely
 It's perfect for travel if you can only take one lens


 Its perfect for snaps of family indoors or out since the aperture is f/2.8 throughout the whole zoom range

 Unlike the Tamron lenses like their 28-300 (for example), this lens isn't soft and doesn't have a beige cast to the photos, its contrasty and has good color rendition.Nice job Tamron!

$REVIEW.: I will start this review off by saying that I have this lens mounted on a Nikon D700. I've owned several 50mm primes, and know that there are a lot of in depth reviews comparing them, so I won't get into all that.Before I bought this lens I was using the Nikon 50mm f/1.4G af-s lens. This is a beautiful lens! However, I had bought the Sigma 85mm 1.4 and loved it so much that I wanted to look into their 50mm as well. I love creamy smooth backgrounds, and am always on the lookout for a lens (for the right price) that can give fantastic results!Just as I experienced with the Sigma 85mm, this lens was gorgeous and sharp right out of the box! I had no issues with auto focus, and I LOVE shooting wide open. The bokeh this lens creates is beautifully smooth, and the lens has great color and contrast. I do prefer the bokeh of the sigma 50mm lens to my nikon. I know for some this isn't everything, but to me it is.I don't feel like this lens is bulky or heavy. It feels great on my D700, and seems to balance it out nicely. If you are considering this lens, I say go for it! You won't be disappointed!

$REVIEW.: UPDATE 2: Got the replacement finally. Hooked Cable box via Component to Receiver and HDMI from receiver goes to TV. Same issue. After heating up a bit, gives blue screen. All HDMI is having no issues. This cannot be a TV issue. If somebody has a similar setup and not having this issue the please advice in comments about how to setup correctly.UPDATE- The problem of blue screen starts when the receiver becomes a little hot (after running for 15-20 minutes)===========================================================Got my 706 last Wednesday. Ever since I hooked my cable box (moto via component) the blue screen problem started. Any surge in brightness makes the screen blue i.e. the VIDEO signal goes out of sync. Now this thing is happening in upconversion only. Down conversion is ok from my BD player to 720p TV. This is the first issue and has been happening pretty consistently.The second issue is, there is a lot of lag between switching from one source to the other. If I switch from BD player to Cable the screen goes blue for 5 seconds. This is too big a lag. The audio switching is pretty instantaneous.The third problem is, when I press setup button on the remote, the screen goes blue again and for an agonizing long time. Thankfully the setup screen does come up !!So it is "ALL BLUE" story so far.To add to my blues, Onkyo support is trying to convince me that this is some problem with my cable box, which has been working fine for two years now. I am pretty convinced that the Faroudja DCDi chip is overheating. Found out now, in various forums. Talking about Onkyo support, they think they can fool people around. They have long waiting times on support calls. There are no experts to solve your issue. The call reps go back and forth adding to the wait time. I am waiting for another call on monday and if they try to convince me that it is my cable box issue, I will have to return this to Amazon.I have given 2 stars for the sound and ease of setup. I would not recommend this receiver to anybody until Onkyo fixes this stupid problem.

It has vibration reduction, which is not really needed for macro work, since these are generally manually focused. However, for hand-held shots as a short telephoto, the VR comes in handy and helps get sharp images. I use this lens on a D5100 and am very happy with the shots I have taken so far. At 2.8 it is plenty fast for both macro and general use, and it has really nice bokeh.

$REVIEW.: I bought this item and it worked fine with my Alpine


 However, it doesn't work as well as an adapter that has an iPod plug
 So I went to eBay and found a 5V adapter from a company called "deluxe-item" in Hong Kong

 This has both an iPod plug AND a regular stereo 1/8" mini

 The advantage of this setup is that you also hook this up to any 12v lead and ground which is activated by turning the ignition/acc on

 Thus, it also charges the iPod

 The quality was far better than I expected and it included an inline fuse
 The only downside is that shipping from Hong Kong takes a couple of weeks


 I paid $12.99 for the item
 I guess I'm one of the lucky ones that only had to turn the AUX on in the setup menu.

$REVIEW.: It is important to note that this sound device is not for everyone and it is less ideal for surround sound users than those of us just looking for high quality stereo. The sound quality is tremendous for 2 channel sound and generally reliable to a point. You have to understand the limitations of using a USB sound device. YOU MUST have a powerful enough CPU to process the sound information and because of the fact that it uses the USB connection whatever else shares that bandwidth like a wireless USB network adapter will impact the audio with possible hiccups and crackle when transferring large amounts of data.In 2 channel mode at 24 bit 96khz when coupled with a quad core processor your chances of the best quality audio experience are greatest. Even with my Phenom II 920 @ 2.8ghz during downloads from STEAM transferring my games with my wireless USB network adapter at a 135 mbps connection leads to crackle when listening to music at the same time. USB only has so much bandwidth and using 5.1 surround only lets its limitations become more prominent.

I already own a 5.1 home theater surround sound but wanted a 2.1 audiophile system to listen to music, watch movies, and play video games. I opted for the Sony STRDH130 as I've had good experience with Sony receivers before, with my other audio system being connected to a Sony receiver. I was able to turn this into a 2.1 system by using a Polk Audio PSW10 subwoofer that allows you to hook up this receiver to it, and then output the audio from the subwoofer to the two speakers, which are Pioneer SP-BS21-LR. Install took approximately 1 hour including cutting and preparing my own 16 gauge speaker wire that I purchased along with the receiver. The AUX port on the back of the receiver is great for hooking up an MP3 player/smartphone directly or hooking it into an Airport Express which allows you to stream music wirelessly to this receiver. I left all of the settings on the receiver at the default as I controlled the equalizer directly on my MP3 player wirelessly over Airplay. Total cost for this system including the 50ft of 16 gauge speaker wire cost approx. $245 give or take a few dollars. The sub was $80, the pioneers were $40 for the pair (on sale), and the receiver was $118. This is much much better than a soundbar and subwoofer setup. The sound is very deep, rich, and warm with great high notes. I uploaded a picture of my complete setup under the user pictures for this product. I highly recommend this alternative if you're not looking to break the bank.

$review_text.: These are excellent computer speakers
 Good sound


 Not as attractive as some, but not an eyesore

 Important to me is that they lack the constant background buzz or hum that some other computer speakers seem to suffer from.A bit of information I couldn't seem to find: the speakers are 6 3/4" high.

$review_text.: I got this system with an onkyo TX-SR307 5.1 receiver


 These speakers are ok, but you could easily get better ones for around $300 from klipsch

 I got these, because they are small, and for bragging rights

 I have them paired with a kicker solobaric l5 12 inch and a dayton 500 Watt RMS subwoofer amplifier

 They are very clear, and give me some good frequency response

 If I had to buy them again, I would still buy the bose, but klipsch are still a lot better
 The acoustimass that comes with this system is also very bad
 It plays the low end sounds that these speakers can't play, but it does not fill in the bass very good


 It is more of a midwoofer to me, thats why I have the kicker solobaric.



$review_summary.: Great with a nice subwoofer.

$review_text.: I installed the battery in the phone and put the phone in its' cradle to charge, as another reviewer recommended that you fully charge the battery before using it.  Within a second or two the screen reported the battery was "fully charged!"  The battery was delivered fully charged!  Wow!  I thought I would get something that had been on a shelf forever.  You might say, "Someone charged it before sending it out.", but you would be wrong.  The plastic packaging was sealed tight and had not been disturbed.  The battery was absolutely fresh from the manufacturer.  The phone has been operating normally ever since.  This is a top quality battery!I will do an update should anything change.Someone just asked for dimensions.  It is 1-1/4" wide by 2-1/8" long.  The photo raises questions because it is distorted.

$review_text.: Long Story Short: This is not an audiophile product and is also not a powerhorse.  This amp is easy to overload and when you do, you will hear a click as it temporarily cuts off.  With that said...So long as you keep your expectations reasonable, this is an excellent little amp.  It handled my Pyle speakers well, providing music to a noisy NYC balcony.  And now it is driving the same speakers in my home office, attached to my desktop computer.  An excellent complement to my streamed music while working at my desk.  It is pretty cute too.

$review_text.: The first time I purchased these was in 2005.  Newegg stopped selling these so now I will buy them here.  Don't believe the poor reviews.  The quality is good, they last as long as any other pair of headphones.They stay on well when running (trails mostly, 6-8 mi 6:30 pace).I have even used them at work back when I was a MIG Welder--they they fit perfectly behind my welding helmet, and were loud enough to hear over the weld static WHILE wearing OSHA ear-plugs! They also clean up much better than most headphones, I would literally wash them off every day with lava soap and they held-up just fine.In other words the quality is great.When I first purchased them, I was curious about how these would feel,but they feel much better than normal over-the-head headphones.Their ear-pads are especialy nice, as they are super soft with a velvety soft texture.Sleek design,extremely comfortable fit,WATERPROOF!!,LOUD and CLEAR sound,extra microfoam pads and earhuggers, (changing pads and ear-huggers is not difficult--despite what other reviewers may have said).Way to go Logitech!

$review_text.: I am coming from a LG LE8500 Infinia 47 smart tv purchased in 2011.. I wanted to upgrade and take advantage of a tv set with 3D to have as an option and upgrade my tv size to a 55. now im not totally stuck on 3D but with all the awesome blu rays coming out now and technology i wanted to have this experience starting in 2014. after extensive research (as i do with all my products) and being that i was a previous LG owner i wanted to stick with the brand that i trusted. I wanted a good price and i was going with the GA7900 but couldnt find a good deal on the 55 inch. i shopped and shopped around until i was up one night and decided to look on amazon. and i came across the LG6900 for a great price in the 55 inch range.. i wanted 240hz but i said well let me just read reviews on this model and i was ok with the 120hz. and thats how i came up with this model.  Placed the order called amazon with question i had as i never purchased a big item like this from them before.. amazon customer service is great as always and the &#34;big ticket&#34; dept. answered my question efficiently and thoroughly and i get amazon reward credit to use as a promotion from this purchase.Delivery- I must point out that the delivery process was flawless i read alot of bad reviews about these companies i had CEVA and they were great tv arrived via CEVA they came within the time frame, opened the box, drilled the stand on. removed my prior set all in great time and were great about it.. got my tracking info, arrived the day they said it would, even called ahead of time and got answers. two gentlemen arrived and the time frame given originally . all in great presence. box was not damaged tv was not damaged everything worked out great. Thank you CEVA.LG LA6900-...  then i turned the tv and and WOW...the Picture looked amazing out of the box i couldnt believe it.  i starting going through the set up process which was fairly easy to navigate and do. the remote i had to get use to or &#34;magic wand&#34; i should say.  set everything up all is well. and i tried netflix. hulu. some blu rays etc. all looked great and i was loving the 55inches ! said i was in heaven. blacks are black, colors vibrant and popped!  thanks to the &#34;local dimming&#34; and &#34;led plus&#34;  in this set thanks to LG. i knew there was a break in period but as the days went by and to this day i am amazed at the picture quality. it was a step up from my LE8500 which was also great but i notice that processing and technology had changed since this set. the settings are easy enough to adjust straight forward. i didnt use any professional calibration but i have an experience with my prior sets and it worked out fine for me. the bezel-less frame looks great in the living room even when the tv is turned off. i have had people over and they cant believe how thin it was and turned the tv on and 2D/HD looked great. menus are easy to follow its so man options. but im no videophile but i will tell you this is a great looking tv set. if your one that dont care about the &#34;features&#34; or even 3D and just want a tv set then yes.. this is a great looking tv set afterall that was my first object. Dark scenes look excellent, i didn't notice any banding as the scenes transition. bright scenes were great very vibrant and colorful. its a great look. even apps like youtube from roku and apple tv looks great i go on youtube mainly from my tv now and as little as possible from the laptop. whites are white and vibrant. colors look accurate i love it. so i will tell you yes the tv is delivers on performance hands down in my opinion.3D- not huge on 3D BUT..... i tried THOR part 2 , Despeciable me, gravity!!, and a few more and WOW! the 3d looks great. being that its passive i had no problem getting use to it plus it was like going to the movies. and the set came with a box of four pair of 3D glasses, comfortable to wear for extended hours no problems. then i decided to try walking dead on a sunday night... HOLY S...!! it was great. i dont use the 3D alot but i wanted to see how good the 2D to 3D conversion works.. and let me tell you It did justice !. zombies movement was real. the ambiance of the atmosphere etc. it was freaking great!! i said yes... i now know what i been missing. I dont play video games so i wouldnt know what its like in 3d but overall 3D looks great. heck i might buy a xbox one or ps4 just because of how good it works later this year but for now i dont do gaming and all. havent tried sports yet in 3d either but i will eventually. overall it works pretty good. im hearing LG does 3d well overall.Smart Hub- netflix worked great. hulu was fine. but i have an apple tv, roku 3, preordered the new roku streaming stick coming out next month, so i dont use this feature much along with the apps and all. maybe one day i'll play around with it but i mainly wanted a great picture to start with.. but i have great wifi in my home very fast. and i have the tv on wifi its nice to have in case i need it in the future but im more of a media box such as roku and apple tv kind of guy. but you can also hook up via ethernet cord as well and its plenty of apps to play around with.Remote- works great. it does take some getting use to, my hand to eye correlation is pretty good. got it down pat within a few hrs but i use a standard remote  for watching movies due to play and pause and all. but its great kind of cool the whole &#34;mouse effect and i think anyone can get use to it. and the voice search feature is great to i tried it a few times to see how it well it works and its cool a young lady pops up and listens to what your searching for kind of funny lol. nice work LG.Overall I say its a great tv set that only gets better as you view it for the long run. havent had any problems, no dead pixels thank god, and i enjoy it. it was a great upgrade. looks good at night and in the daytime. has some clear coat on tv screen itsself so reflection and glare  is not  bad. all viewing angles are great from left to right didnt have problems with that. have had people over to enjoy 3D viewing and 2D all have been impressed although i wanted to make sure at the end of the day i was satisfied. im happy with this option i choose. and like the prior set happy with this model even more.So I say get it and see it for yourself its great. hope this review helped and please dont be afraid to ask any questions and ill answer to my best ability.

$REVIEW.: I did a lot of research before settling on this item
 The five year warranty was a big factor, as some manufacturer's only have one year guarantees
 So far, it's worked well, backing up about 25 gb of data with plenty left to spare


 It's a bit slower than my larger back-up external hard drive, but the smaller size does mean you sacrifice some speed

 But it's plenty small and lightweight, and kind of cute

 It also seems not to get too hot even after running for a few hours, another good sign
 I can watch video or listen to music files direct from the drive, and they all open up quickly and play just fine
 It's a good deal for the small size, large storage capability (for a small drive), and the fact that it doesn't need a power adapter, making it even more portable
 Just tuck it into a small pocket in your laptop case and you're good to go


 It also includes a y-USB adapter, in case your computer doesn't put enough power out from a single USB port to power it up
 I used it on a single USB port, and it powered up fine.

$REVIEW.: I recently bought my A55 at local retailer, as a replacement for my aging Minolta Maxxum 7D
 In the past I have owned the Sony DSC-R1, A100, and A700 but had sold them to pursue other interests, keeping the 7D and the Sony DSC-R1

 Recently I had been frustrated with focus issues on both cameras in low light, along with unusable photos at anything more that ISO800


 (the R1 is better than the 7D in this regard)  I fondly remembered my A700 and wished for it back.So I thought I'd step up and buy another Sony to improve my chances of getting decent low light shots


 Nikon and Canon were out of the question because I have several beautiful examples of Minolta's A-mount lenses that I refuse to part with


 Reviews looked very good for the A55 so I bought one.Here's what I really like about it.1

 Focus magnification - when I use my manual focus lenses I can confirm focus very accurately

 I can't count how many shots were slightly out of focus when using my 7D2

 image quality is miles ahead of my other cameras at iso1600, and 3200 is usable, better than 1600 on the 7D and R1.3


 exposure control is very good, even in difficult light, and even with my manual lenses which have no electronic connection to the camera


 The 7D always drastically underexposed with manual lenses.4

 the electronic viewfinder is excellent

 the R1 has an electronic viewfinder which isn't as good, so I was a little worried about this


 But no need, its great.5
 the size of the camera is great, very light weight, especially compared to the 7D!!6

 i love the tilt / turn screen for low angle shots close to the ground.Some stuff I don't like, or wish was different.1

 bracketing is only 3 steps, only up to +/- .7ev

 Sometimes I want more for good HDR shots


 The camera is so fast, taking 5 bracketed shots should be a no-brainer.2
 the 7D has buttons for everything, very easy to change settings on the fly very quickly
 The A55 requires use of the admittedly simple function button and menu for a lot of these changes

 It is the biggest change for me

 Even changing the focus area on the 7D was almost instant and intuitive, the A55 requires a bunch of button presses

 The DSC-R1 has a dedicated exposure compensation wheel under your thumb, on the A55 you press a button then turn a wheel
 Of course the small size of the A55 makes external buttons for everything difficult.I tried one brief video clip, it seems almost as good as my little point-and-shoot Canon sx130 for video


 I won't use video much so I really don't care


 I haven't tried the continuous shooting mode yet

 I did try the Pano thing, and in-camera HDR, and they seem to work as advertised, although I can't see myself using them much.I would go for 5-stars except for the control button / menu thing
 I am sure I will get used to it, but at the moment it frustrates me trying to change settings quickly while photographing, especially when there is a time limit
 (high-school show choir as an example, gotta be quick or they move again!)That being said, I can get images from the A55 that just aren't possible with the 7D and the R1


 If somehow the workings of the A55 could be installed in the body of my 7D, I'd be in heaven!!

But, with the new place, reluctantly had to go back to wireless so I researched extensively and came across this guy, and I'm here to say this is the one to get.The setup is exceedingly simple, and as usual I didn't bother using the setup disk.  But forget the setup, its always reliability that's given me problems, and this router has performed like a champ.

$REVIEW.: Okay, well not being a 3D expert, I'm going to do an overview of my observations thus far.I also own 3 pair of the cheaper $20 Samsung models, which work great too... just look silly and don't block background light as well.Pros of Panasonic:More wraparound, blocks out background light better than Samsung variety.More comfortable for me (adult with a big head...)Rechargeable!!Has an amazing &#34;2d&#34; Mode so my wife, who hates 3D can watch in &#34;normal&#34; mode while the kids and I watch in 3D..Without this mode, she would either have to put up with 3d or look at a blurry screen.Cons:At around $60 dollars you could buy 3 pair of the Samsung which work fine, just not as nice.Also, the Panasonic doesn't fit my 3 year old's head.I'd say get the Samsung for kids and guests, get the Panasonic for mom and dad.

$REVIEW.: I have been struggling with Samsung some time to repair, or replace the outrageously expensive glasses I purchased from them to work with the mentioned TV's. I have purchased DXG glasses which were a bit better, darker picture, lost sync like Samsung's, and were darker it seemed.These glasses aren't only lighter in heft and lens color, but they are firmware upgrade-able to better performance. Also from the Xpand website you can download an app to further tweak the glasses on/off rate to suite other peoples vision/tv performance. They are durable, rechargeable, and comfortable after using supplied nose pieces.They stayed synced with the TV's no problem, and are easily configured to do so through there application.Only CON was the rubber fitting cover the USB port on the ear piece fell of on all of the pairs I bought, 5 in all. They also use a proprietary USB plug... I am tired of the different cords I have laying around!! Standards people!!!!All in all, very happy with their performance.

$review_text.: I purchased this monitor before G-sync went live and fell deeply in love with the response rate and the 144hz speed. I am a professional gamer and play games that require twitch movement and speed. I went from a 70Hz 6ms Asus monitor to this whopping 144Hz 1ms monitor and I DEFINITELY notice a difference. From games such as Starcraft and CS:GO, this monitor provides you with the edge in game. I demand performance and this is exactly what it gave me and more.I installed G-Sync following the DIY tutorial on NVIDIA's web site. The installation was easy granted that I have experience dismantling and building computers and components. The overall installation only took 20 minutes for me and really improved my gaming performance. The twitch games such as CS:GO are the kind that I really saw a jump in improvement. The G-Sync along with the 1ms and 144Hz gave games such as BF4, Crysis, and CS:GO a great boost in fluidity and responsiveness.As stated before, my old monitor was 6 years old and this upgrade turned my whole life around. The responsiveness, cleanliness, and fluidity are very noticeable and give me more of an enjoyable gaming experience. I have even restarted various games such as Metro and Bioshock because the gameplay was that much more enjoyable with this monitor and with G-sync installed.If you are in the market for a gaming monitor that is G-sync capable, look no further. For the price you are getting a top-notch monitor with the capability of adding g-sync to really boost your experience. This is by far one of the most important parts of my gaming rig i have purchased and is one that I highly recommend to anyone who wants to get the most out of their computer and their gaming experience.Side note: I have recently ditched my 60hz 42in TV from my living room since I am no longer able to bare the slow 60Hz. I now watch TV on my Asus monitor...
$SUMMARY.: G-Sync ready and AMAZING

$review_text.: I purchased this flash for extra reach and to bounce the flash of walls and ceilings to give a softer affect. The built in diffuser does much the same thing with the flash pointed directly at the subject, which is a really nice touch.Being a P-TTL it does what the cameras pop up flash does - only better. Not sure about the red light sensor which is supposed to help the camera autofocus in dark situations, it's a bit faint imo.$99 Is a really good price for a dedicated Pentax flash, after the first week of limited use, I can highly recommend it.

$review_text.: Good introduction to the Canon 5D Mark III camera.  I went from a Digital Rebel to the Mark III which was a significant jump in technology.  Many of the features I was completely new to, and the video explained some of them to an adequate detail.  You are not going to watch this and walk away with a great depth of knowledge of this camera.  This is after all, "Basic Controls."  It is a good starting point.
$SUMMARY.: Good Introduction

$review_text.: Great for the price, I am a former PJ/Marketing person and I think I got a great lens. Some individuals are not that pleased but it does it all quite well. Yes, it is not a $5,000 dollar lens but still darn good. For the web or digital prints &#34;its the px of the camera more than the lens&#34;. The only issue I have with mine is that if you take the lens lock off and point the camera at the ground the lens will extend. But I think that's just my lens. When you know it does it, you learn to adjust.
$SUMMARY.: good little lens

$review_text.: In theory this is a great product.  The only problem is they are trying to do way to much for the price point.  This thing needs a lot of work.  Manual is not very good and the web site is no better.  I spent 3 hours trying to get it to do what they claim in can do and failed.  I have worked with complicated equipment my whole life so complicated products don't bother me.  It just doesn't work for what its intended.  Too bad, I really didn't want to spend $100+ dollars for a tuner.  My recommendation is to read all the reviews and decide whether someone has had success with your configuration.  All I needed was something for my projector.  I could have done without all the other geewiz functions.  They don't work anyway.
$SUMMARY.: Perfect example of market engineering

$review_text.: The grid part of this works fine, it's just a little bulky and awkward. I would prefer something that has a better mounting design and pay a little extra. Not bad just not that great either.

$review_text.: What a huge mistake to put Annoying Pop Up ad's in a device that is so personal like a GPS Navigation unit! the last thing I want to do is fuss with pop up ads on my garmin navi unit.This is a gross intrusion into my personal space and I will reject these advertisers every single time.Whatever AD I see pop up on this unit I will make double the effort to avoid shopping or buying whatever product pops up.  I can assure you that everyone else will do the same.Stay away from these new units until someone on the internet figures out a way to hack the Ad's.

$REVIEW.: I needed a padded bag to hold my SLR camera body and lenses in my suitcase for compact travel
 This XL bag works great for that purpose


 I can squeeze my camera in with the 17-55 lens attached, too


 However, I don't want to damage the bag by doing so
 It also wouldn't protect the camera enough while traveling if the lens is attached

 Great neoprene bags, however, the medium bag was more than large enough for my 55-250 lens and didn't need the large bag, which I purchased for that lens, along with the medium bag for my 17-55 lens

 I also purchased a neoprene camera case to protect while walking with my camera around my neck and not taking photos

 Keeps sand out of my camera when at the beach.


$SUMMARY.: Holds SLR camera body to protect when traveling

$REVIEW.: I bought this Dash Mount to use with my Garmin C330 GPS for our trip to California. We drove from LAX to San Diego, back up to San Francisco, San Jose and back to LAX. It never slipped or fell even while driving on very steep hills in San Francisco. It works great not only in rental car, but I use it in my own car as well since it can be easily removed
$SUMMARY.: Great product - Works great with my Garmin C330

$REVIEW.: I bought this webcam in December and although it is clear from the start you have a much sharper image then your friends webcams, only after several months I realize HOW good the picture is in low light conditions.While other webcams (including cheaper Logitech ones) give you grain, noise and wrong colors in dim light, the Quickcam Pro 9000 is almost as good as in daylight.I found the holding "clip" a little awkward at first, but it does its job.Works perfectly with Windows XP and Skype 3.8.0.115 (and the previous Skype version as well).Note that I didn't bother with the software CD contents but downloaded the newest Logitech Quickcam 11.50 software from their website right away

Make sure the "Cancel echo" option is turned on for best audio quality.(I still haven't tried it with Windows 2000, it seems you can only use the version 11.00 Logitech software as it is the last one officially supporting W2k...)Update: doesn't work with Windows 2000 as Logitech provides no drivers for it.Highly recommended!


$SUMMARY.: Extremely good low light video quality

$REVIEW.: I use this for photos, music, video, the usual and find it an incredible device. Of course I have not owned it long enough to judge durability. I love the built in speaker, although the sound is not great. It is useful when you want to share a favorite tune with someone else.  I works as promises.  I only wish that cell phone and MP3 device manufacturers, including Apple, would stop trying to make stuff smaller.  This could use an extra inch in each dimension which would make it much easier to use and better for viewing.  Perhaps the energy draw would be too much.  The only thing that is negative, and we all know about this, is that this thing is so protective of digital rights, I can't load half my music on it because of incompatible formats or lack of license,  even though it came from MY cd collection.  On balance, buy it you will like it.

$review_text.: This little box really packs a punch

Right out of the box it is very easy to setup


It doesn't occupy much space


It works seamlessly with Windows Media Center

It is definitely the inexpensive way to own your own DVR and what's best is (I think), you get to manage your own DVR recordings

Unlike the DVRs that are offered by the cable/satellite companies, you can never keep them or port them somewhere else - they must reside on the DVR hard disk itself
Unless you get a TiVO.I would definitely recommend anyone to get this if your requirement is to record or watch over the air channels (HD incl.).SiliconDust HDHomeRun Dual High Definition Digital Television HDHR3-US (Black)

$REVIEW.: I am not an audiophile, but I do like the quality of the sound from these earbuds as well these other features: in-ear comfort, good sound isolation, length of the cord, and apparent durable construction.  The bass is a bit weaker than I'd like, but I expect that all earbuds are that way.Anyway, the first set of J2 earbuds I received were defective in that the left side did not match the right side in sound quality at mid to high volumes.  I sent JLab Audio a description of the problem, and their "customer care ambassador" promptly sent me a replacement.  As others have written here, JLab Audio is an impressive company that stands behind their good products.

There is a pen clip in the way when I use the stylus, but it doesn't bother me, probably because the pen is wide enough to make it less noticeable

$REVIEW.: Portable Wi-Fi storage drives are very useful and do a good job of complimenting our mobile lifestyles.  The Corsair Voyager Air is a portable Wi-Fi hard drive, but with a feature that most of the competitors don't have: a wired Ethernet connection.  In addition to being a Wi-Fi storage drive, the Ethernet connection allows the Voyager Air (VA) to also act as a portable NAS device.PROS- Great-looking enclosure- Very fast USB 3.0 performance- Good battery life- Nice selection of bundled accessories- Good overall performanceCONS- Not DLNA-compliant, yet- Rudimentary mobile appsIN THE BOXThe packaging for the VA looks nice with colorful graphics and useful technical data on the box.  Inside the box, you'll find the quick start guide, USB to DC power cable, USB 3.0 cable, drawstring pouch, car power adapter (2.0A), and a wall power adapter (2.0A).DESIGN & FEATURESThe front of the VA has two physical switches for device power on/off and Wi-Fi on/off.  There are also four LEDs to indicate power, battery life, charging indicator, and Wi-Fi.  The enclosure comes in black on black as well as a red on black color combinations.  The DC-IN, USB 3.0 port, and Ethernet jack are all located in the back of the VA.  On the bottom, there are four large rubber feet and reset pin hole.  Inside the VA, I found a 1TB 5400RPM Toshiba drive (MQ01ABD100).  There's also a 6200 mAh lithium-ion battery (non-replaceable) that's rated for up to 7 hours of continuous streaming.The Corsair mobile apps are very basic, but work well for their intended purpose.  You can play multimedia files with the Voyager Air app, as well as edit them (delete, rename, copy, move, etc.).  You can also move files from your mobile device to the VA if you want to free up storage on your mobile device.  The Voyager Air app worked fine on a Galaxy Nexus, Kindle Fire HD, an Android tablet and an iPad (4th gen).  However, I couldn't get it to work correctly on a Samsung Galaxy Note II (Verizon Android 4.1.2).  I usually prefer using ES File Explorer anyways, so it wasn't really an issue.  You don't even need the app to change the settings because you can just point your browser to the VA's internal web server (to change the Wi-Fi network name, password, Wi-Fi channel, and passthru settings).  You can secure the VA's Wi-Fi connection by adding a password, but there's no option to hide the SSID (network name).The VA isn't DLNA-compliant, so when connected to your home network via Ethernet, your DLNA devices (TV, Blu-ray player, Xbox, etc.) won't be able to stream media from the Voyager Air.  However, Corsair is working on adding DLNA and AirPlay, which will come down as a firmware update.As I mentioned earlier, in addition to USB 3.0 and Wi-Fi, the VA also has an Ethernet port that allows you to connect it to your network as a portable NAS device.  It's a cool and fun way to expand storage on your network.  Think about it: a battery-operated 1 TB network drive that you can carry with you.PERFORMANCEAs an external hard drive over USB 3.0, the VA is screaming fast at 123 MB/s read and 122 MB/s write, as tested in CrystalDiskMark.  To test the Ethernet connection, I copied a 2.93 GB test file from my local hard drive to the VA over the network.  I got a transfer rate of 21MB/s and the file copied in 2 min 25 sec.  As a comparison, the test file copied in just 26 seconds at a transfer rate of 115 MB/s over USB 3.0.  Wi-Fi performance was good enough to stream HD videos without any buffering issues or stalls, including when I streamed to two devices simultaneously.Internet browsing performance took a sizable hit when using the pass-thru feature, but that's pretty typical of devices like this.  Unfortunately, the pass-thru connection only works over the  2.4GHz band, so if you have a dual-band router, you won't be able to take advantage of your faster 5GHz network.  The wireless range of the VA is about 90 feet, which should be more than enough for most uses.CONCLUSIONCorsair took their time getting the Voyager Air out to the party, but they got it mostly right.  A combination of an external hard drive, portable NAS, and Wi-Fi sharing drive, the VA has solid build quality, looks great, and offers lots of great features.  A bit more polish on the mobile apps would've been nice, but that's a minor complaint really.  If you're looking for a super-versatile portable Wi-Fi storage drive, I'd start with the Corsair.

$review_text.: For the price this is one of the best, slimmest tilting wall mounts available


 We used it on a Samsung 40" LCD and it took about 15 minutes to get installed

 The tilt is the best part of this mount and allows us to change the angle (when seated in the couch vs


playing Wii sports or something) quickly and with minimal effort

 The build quality is very good for the price point as well, many other sub $100 mounts feel flimsy, like if you don't mount it exactly in the sweet spot, you're TV will fall off the wall


 No such worries here


 The brackets are heavy and sturdy and you know when you set it on the rails that it's no moving

 It took us a long time to decide to mount our TV, now we wish we'd done it so much sooner!Other than the tilt, the best feature is just how slim it is


 Doesn't add much width when mounted at all
 Great for clearing up some space

 If you have a TV within the ranges for this mount, get it, you will not be disappointed with your purchase.

$review_summary.: Very good wall mount, would be worth 3-4x the price!

This case is made for hard silicone.  It has a good feel, but this cover is probably more for aesthetics and some scratch protection.

$REVIEW.: I wanted a range expander to improve wireless reception in my house. My router is in the basement and I have two floors above that. I picked this item because it was inexpensive and looked like it would be simple to install and use.During installation from the included CD-ROM on my laptop computer the software did a scan for the Cisco-Linksys expander but could never find it. From some of the other reviews I had read I thought this might be caused by my network WEP security. I tried some of the suggestions in the reviews but without success. So I decided to call Cisco-Linksys technical support.The Cisco-Linksys technical support representative would not provide free help - I had to pay. She said that the unit was out of warranty by several months even though I had just received it. Granted this is a refurbished unit but the box had a sticker that said "90-Day Warranty". I assumed this meant from the date of my purchase - not when the company that sold me the unit bought it. However, not so. It's out of warranty before it arrives at your house.I've bought other refurbished products before and this is the first time I had a problem like this. Usually, the deal with a refurb is that it comes with a decent (often same as new) warranty, otherwise it's just a used unit - a whole different category.If as has been suggested by some of the other reviewers that enabled network security is the problem with the installation of this product, then I would ask all of you who had no problems installing this item: Are you running an unsecured wireless network and, if so, why? All of your network traffic is being broadcast to anyone within range who wants to listen!My 1-star rating is based on the lack of support from the manufacturer. I never got far enough with it to either love or hate it on its own terms. It is probably a good piece of equipment once you get it installed. I'll never know because I returned mine.

$REVIEW.: I do a lot of phone tech support (and have for many years now), so I rely on my headset heavily. I need the sound to be loud and clear on BOTH ends, and I need them to be comfortable enough to wear for many hours at a time.It's hard to believe these $10 Panasonic KX-TCA60 headsets are still the best I've tried out of 8 different models / 4 different brands over the past 8+ years (and many of the ones I tried were much more expensive). For example, I've had $40+ Plantronics models that could not match the volume level and clarity of these. Even the Uniden headset that came with my Uniden 5.8Ghz phones was inferior to the sound quality and volume of these.I been using these KX-TCA60's for years now and they're all I'll buy any more. I currently use mine with my Uniden TRU-9485 handsets and I'm extremely happy (so are my callers, since we hear each other loud & clear).I will admit that I purchase them two at a time because I've had some KX-TCA60's that only lasted a couple years (for example, the swivel for the boom does eventually get loose over a long period of time to the point where it won't stay where you've adjusted it) but that's after heavy use and abuse. That plus I tend to roll over the cord with my chair sometimes and it can only endure that so many times before you damage it, but overall these are really pretty rugged.I would definitely recommend these to anyone who has handsets of ANY brand with headset jacks on them (like I said, these work better with my Uniden phones than my Uniden headset does!), and who spends long hours in calls each day. I hope Panasonic never stops making these!!

$REVIEW.: The Comply tips really do significantly improve the sound of the ER-4Ps over using the Etyomotic 3-flange silicone tips.  The highs are just a tad less sizzly and the bass is substantially improved.  I spent a lot of time in the past designing, constructing, evaluating, measuring speakers and other audio equipment, and visiting higher end audio shops.  My goal is a natural, close-to-live sound.  The Complys are definitely a step up in that direction from any of the Etymotic tips (of which, unfortunately, only the 3-flange silicone tips fit me).  So that is a 4- or 5-star component of my rating.What brings the rating down is that they don't last at all.  Maybe my ears are different or what, but within two months of only about 3 hours/week usage, both tips tore.  Before that they had already absorbed oils and wax and were getting slippery, lessening the quality of the seal.  They also direct ear wax into the filter area of the Etys more than other tips, as they have a shape that's almost like a funnel into the end of the Etys.  This is really unfortunate, as I am getting maybe 20 hours of use out of a pair of tips.  I didn't see this noted in any of the other reviews (but may have missed some).If you like the idea of the Complys and don't have a lot of wax or oils in your ear canals, I would definitely recommend this product as your first step, as it lets you try out the different sizes.  I found that the larges fit me by far the best, which I was somewhat surprised about.

$review_text.: This is one of the best purchases I've ever made. This camera is tiny, yet powerful, and the quality of the video it produces is really quite nice. I especially like that it compensates for the unsteadiness of the human hand by automatically correcting what it &#34;sees&#34; so that it doesn't look shaky. We very rarely need to use the zoom feature, but it works well. Selection and playback of your videos is simple and convenient, using the same controls and display as you use for shooting videos. The camera acts as an external drive when connected to my Linux machine via USB, so it's a simple matter of copying the files off of it with my Linux file manager when I want to transfer them to my computer. It's a shame they stopped making this thing, because you can't get anything as good for the price elsewhere. I'm really glad we got it.

$review_text.: I was hit by a car in October 2010 and am currently going through physical therapy and rehabilitation.  I can't go cycling until at least January 2012, but I can ride myCycleOps Fluid 2 Indoor Bicycle Trainerfor 30 minutes a day as part of my physical therapy.  And with this cycling computer which I bought since going on Disability, I am happy to say I can also monitor my speed, distance, cadence, heart rate, calories, time, et cetera even while stationary--which I couldn't do with any of my previous cycling computers because they had the sensor on the front wheel and couldn't read off the back wheel.  In other words, you don't have to have a GPS signal and be moving for this cycling computer to read your speed.The calculations are extremely accurate due to the user and bicycle profile settings.  Most notably, you can have the unit calculate the wheel size automatically--so no more best guesses or charts.  You will also be asked to input your birth date, weight, and the weight of your bicycle.  Most cycling computers will take two profiles--this one takes three.The difference here is that the sensor and magnet go on the rear wheel, so whether I'm on the road or trail or sitting still on my stationary trainer, I still get the full benefits of my cycling computer.Besides that, the heart rate monitor strap is perfectly comfortable.  I haven't felt the need to get the 'comfort' strap instead.  I have a 44 inch chest, and have no problem with fit.I have been using Garmin GPS units for years, on the trail, road, on foot, and while driving.  All have given me great functionality and accuracy.  This one is the best yet in every respect.BOTTOM LINE: This is an absolute essential for me as a serious cyclist.  It makes the difference between being completely out of shape when I am physically able to ride again, so that I don't end up spending another year just getting my strength back, and being able to ride right away.Thank you Garmin for another great product.

$REVIEW.: I've owned a Rebel XT for a few years, so bought this camera to upgrade. It's easy to use and if it's anything like the Rebel XT, it will be very reliable. The shutter is responsive. I get live view mode as well as viewfinder shooting. The big LCD screen is very nice. I didn't go through every feature, as most of them I will never use. Moreover, the menu is easy to navigate, and one doesn't get overwhelmed by buttons on the camera. (I also have Nikon equipment.) I give it 5 stars.

$review_text.: Was expecting more of an overall performance boost when I upgraded an older single-core Athlon.  It performs adequately, but that's all.  I should have spent the extra $40 and purchased at least a quad-core instead.  This chip has narrow and limited overclocking capabilities and is pretty much "maxed-out" right out of the box.  I can't fault AMD, this is somewhat better than a dual-core, but not by much.  I truly can't recommend this chip unless you're on a tight budget and have no room for anything better.  It will perform, and be adequate, but don't have any expectations outside of adequate.  One plus - it does do virtualization and runs Windows 7 fairly well, and Windows XP virtualization within Windows 7.  Adequate, but not noteworthy.  I'm saving my $$ for the 6-core and replacing this.

$REVIEW.: For those looking for a budget 17" laptop for play or work, look no further. This is perhaps the best laptop that balance performance, cost, battery life and reliability. Purchased this laptop 2 days ago from Frys, couldn't be happier. This is a list of my observations:Pro:1. Wonderful 17.3" Sony screen - one of the best in the industry. Very bright. Lots of space to work. My work machine has a 24" full HD screen and I don't miss it.2. Super fast second generation Core i5 2.4GHz 2430M 2.4GHz with turbo boost to 3GHz, not the much slower Core i3 and one step above the Core i5 2.3GHz 2410M you see on most lower cost sandy bridge i5 laptops3. Very rigit chasis - no flex at all for a 17" laptop, built quality is valut like - should provide many years of reliable protection. It is the BMW/Benz of laptops.4. Extremely low power consumption - the 4000MAH battery will easily last 4-5 hours on light use - web surfing or working on office apps. I am very impressed.5. Lightweight for a 17.3" laptop - it is quite easy to carry it around, especially since the long battery life means you can usually leave the power adapter at home.6. There are TWO battery upgrade options - a 5300MAH battery (VGP-BPS26) which is the same size and weight as the included battery, but will last 7 hours instead of 5 hours, and a 9 cell, slightly heavier battery which is 7950MAH (VGP-BPL26) and 10 hours battery run-time.7. Blu-Ray drive for watching HD movies. Never get a DVD for a 17" laptop. It is just not appropriate. Believe me you will want to watch Blu Ray on this machine.8. 4xUSB ports, HDMI, VGA, Ethernet, SD/MS slots, Wireless on-off switch9. Wondeful multi-touch touchpad with pinch to zoom and other gestures10. Completely resist finger prints - the only place you are going to leave finger prints on this laptop would be on the screen. Sony has always been pretty good in this regard.Cons:1. Screen resolution is 1600x900 and no option to upgrade it, but it is probably one of the best 1600x900 screens out there. The slightly lower resolution is quite acceptable actually.2. Included battery is 4000MAH, not the 5300MAH version which is the same size and weight3. No backlit keyboard4. Numeric pad makes the keyboard slightly off center5. No bluetooth and no Intel Wireless Display6. No USB 3.0 port7. Speakers a bit weak, crackle a bit at full volume.Immediately upon getting this laptop, I ordered another 4GB Samsung RAM that is identical to the one that is in the laptop, and also purchased an Intel Advanced Wireless 6230 mini-PCI WiFi card to replace the original Atheros WiFi card. The WiFi card upgrade allows me to have bluetooth and also Intel Wireless Display capabilities. The 8GB RAM makes this machine run so fast that most programs simply pop open immediately.Just found out that upgrading to 8GB is a MUST!! It improved Windows experience score from 4.4 to 5.9, and significantly sped up the graphics! 3DMark06 went from 3200 to 4600 by simply upgrading the RAM, looks like the Intel HD 3000 is seriously starved for memory bandwidth. It is now a competent laptop even for casual 3D games!The Windows 7 Experience score (8GB Ram):Overall: 5.9Processor: 7.0Memory: 7.4Graphics: 5.9Gaming graphics: 6.2Primary hard disk: 5.9Very impressive score for a budget 17" laptop!Next purchase will probably be either the 5300MAH (VGP-BPS26) or 7950MAH (VGP-BPL26) battery - can't decide which one though. The 5300MAH is small and light, same size as the original battery. The 7950MAH will last 10 hours and lift the laptop a bit for better cooling and typing angles.Can't be happier with the purchase and looking forward to improve it even further!---------EDIT 10/8/2011--------Made up my mind and ordered a 7950MAH battery (VGP-BPL26)- might as well go for broke and get 10 hours battery life. This means that I will never have to bring the adapter out again, as it is truly an all day computing battery life. Can't wait to get the battery!---------EDIT 10/16/2011--------After using it for more than ten days, I can say that this is truly an excellent laptop with no major faults. The 7950MAH battery arrived and indeed provide more than 10 hours of battery life with light use. It lift the back of the laptop slightly for a better viewing and typing angle. Very glad to have the large battery instead of the standard version!---------EDIT 11/9/2011---------Having lots of fun with this powerhouse machine - running multiple VM on it (8G RAM really helps), the OSX Mac VM is running at twice the speed of my other 2.66GHz Core2Duo Sony. Still very happy with the purchase. Have discovered a minor flaw - the green power button is a bit lose and positioned too close to the right speaker - sometimes it will rattle when you play loud music. Seems like it is just my unit and others are ok. Maybe some play-doh could fix this....---------EDIT 11/24/2011--------To get some extra battery life out of any laptop, try downloading Battery Care from batterycare.net, and you should see anywhere between 10-20% increase in battery life. You should check the "Disable Aero theme in battery mode" and "Pause Windows services in battery mode" to get the savings. If you don't mind having the sidebar disabled, check "Disable the Sidebar / Gadgets in battery mode" to get even more battery life. I have been using it on all my laptops and they work great.

$REVIEW.: This is a tricky review to write. I have an in-house speaker system that was wired into the ceiling when my house was build. It was linked to a Sony amp and FM/AM radio. I also already had a Napster (for my mp3 player) and SiruisXm subscription (for my car) So I thought that this kind of system would be a great addition. I was really looking at this versus the Sonos system, and ultimately I couldn't bring myself to pay $1,000 for the Sonos system, so despite some of the negative reviews, I went with the Squeezebox duet.Overall: Not the best decision in my life, but far from the worst. I'd buy it again based on the cost of it's peers.Pros:-Sound quality is great, but be aware that if you have a good sound system and good ears, music over the internet does sound noticeably poorer than a CD. However, I'll bet most people won't care, and this isn't actually a problem with the system as even the Sonos system can only play the quality it is provided.-It connects to Napster and SiriusXM really well. I've also not had any problems getting it to play (my very limited range of) iTunes songs.-The free radio selection is wide, and interesting. This has helped me broaden my music listening horizons (however, see below).-The click-wheel is ipod inspired, not as good but functional.-The remote feels solid. The wheel is a little odd, as it is mechanical (i.e. it physically spins around) rather than touch based.-I found the setup easy (see notes below).-Much cheaper than the competition. So very much less expensive.Cons:-SiriusXM have milked me for an extra $4 a month for an internet subscription (again, not a fault of the squeezebox, but wasn't clear upon purchase).-The free radio stations that were available when I set up the squeezebox magically disappeared after about a week. Not sure why, I haven't done any research into it, nor called tech support (as I don't care all that much), but definitely loses a start for lack of clarity as to why this happened.-Typing text is a pain. I don't have to do it much, other than to search for songs in Napster. No predictive text, and I just feel that it could have been done better by a different method. I definitely understand the pain of other reviewers who have had to type in their network passwords frequently  (although I have only typed it in once).-It does need your computer to be on to work (although I think that is clear), however I can not, for the life of me, get the squeezebox server to run when the computer starts up, only when I log into my account (I have 2 accounts on Win7). Neither can I get the wake-on-lan function to work, but this might not be the squeezebox's fault. I have not found any fixes to this, however it is not the end of the world for me.

$REVIEW.: I've tried a couple of TP-Link devices recently and been impressed so far. I haven't had any of them long enough to speak to long term reliability, so if anything starts to break down the road, I'll revisit my reviews to pass that information along.For a switch, I'm really only looking to turn my last router port into several router ports, and I think that's the normal need. I have three computers plugged into my router, and need extra for the laser printer, the satellite box, the blu ray player, and the TV ... life was much more simple before every device wanted to be online! LOLTherefore I'm not really putting this device through any high volume paces. I'm only using it for the convenience of having these other devices hit the network on the rare occasions when I need them to. In that respect, this switch has been great. If you have a higher performance need, you might want to check other reviews by the more technical wonks.Highly recommended.

$review_text.: This case offers good protection, but it does have some issues. The most annoying of which is that the headphone jack cover refuse to stay closed. I am tempted to just cut it off.It's also a little bulkier than I expected, but this was just bad expectations on my part since it is an OtterBox case after all.I will use it until it starts looking old, and then I will likely replace it with something else. I am willing to trade off a bit of the protection for a slimmer case.

$REVIEW.: I will not list the pros as many before me have already stated them so let me list the few cons I have found. The bluetooth works on speaker systems, headphones (not the microphone), keyboards, but not the mouse (Logitech android mouse). The usb port links the device to pc and charger but nothing else, like wireless devices and flash drives. The battery does not last as long as advertised. The fingerprints on the screen are bad unlike Samsung tab. Downloads are very slow. When charging cable is attached (which is often) the device is upside down (landscape) when in a cradle so games must be played (in the cradle) without the cable as most only work in the upright position (landscape). Thats about it.

$review_text.: I looked at the Energizer brand name USB cable for PS3 controllers and did sort of raise a brow at the $10 price tag, but I've bought more expensive USB cables so I was about to buy it before I read a couple reviews that convinced me to keep looking. I'm glad I did because I found this cable here on Amazaon for half the price with Prime shipping! Now I don't have to worry about how long I spend playing GoW Collection; when the controller's batt gets low, I just plug this baby in to charge while I play. I'm trying to sit back away from a 52" HDTV so I wanted a cable as long as I could find and 10ft from the PS3 is plenty (about same from TV). I was a little concerned that the item doesn't specifically mention being compatible with PS3 controllers but I found it is and I'm happy with this purchase. I can't yet speak to durability, so after I've had it a few months I'll update this review, but as for now I'm happy w/ my $5 USB PS3 charger cable!UPDATE 3/9/2012:After almost two years, this cable is still going strong. I don't use it as much anymore since I prefer just to be completely wireless (bought a controller charger) but if I've been playing for hours over several days wirelessly and don't wish to stop to allow the charger stand to do it's thing, I do use this 10' monster and I can still sit back comfortably on the couch without worrying about pulling the PS3 off the entertainment stand :) It's in the same great condition as when I bought it so I'd give the durability for a 'cheap' cable FIVE stars!

$review_text.: To set context: I own several sets of headphones, perhaps too many according to my wife. These includes Bose QuietComfort, ATH-M50's, several other sets in drawers that I've long forgotten about and a ton of in-ear headphones. I'm always on the search for good quality headphones for a good price.The short:  If you are looking for great sounding, inexpensive headphones with great build quality for music or games and like bass response, these are for you. When you unpack them, you will feel like you spent twice as much due to the custom fitting case, nice cords and build quality of the headphones. If you are looking for studio monitors, where you will hear every inadequacy in each instrument and every time a guitar player runs fingers down the strings of their guitar, these are not your headphones. If you want a smooth sound and good quality audio without needing to break out an equalizer, these headphones are the place to be.More for those who care:1. Build - Build quality and packaging are clearly important to these folks. These headphones came with the nicest case and accessories I've ever received with a set of headphones built for daily use. The cables are good, the headphones are comfortable and feel well-made. They pay Apple-level attention to detail.2. Bass - Bass response is off the charts. Likely to be too emphasized for some folks, for general listening and non-audiophile quality opinion, I think they are very reasonable, although if you acclimate to them, you might think others are too light in bass. For me, the bass runs too strong but not so bad that I turn on my equalizer and dial it down.3. The Sound - As stated above, if you want studio monitors, these are not for you, there is a lot lost (and gained) due to the way these headphones smooth sound out. If you are a music junkie wanting great audio quality, bass layered on bass, and an overall pleasant sound in a package you can take with you and beat-up without feeling too bad over the price tag, these are right up your alley.4. Sound Isolation - I would not purchase these headphones if my primary purpose was sound isolation. These do block out some background noise but not enough that I would want to throw them on and sleep on a plane with no audio playing.5. Head Feel/Size - Looking at the photos, I expected these headphones to be larger than they were. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that they were more compact than most of my other over-ear headphones. Once adjusted, they are not too tight on my head and are comfortable as a whole, although as with most non-vented headphones, eventually I need to lift the muffs up for a moment to let my ears breathe a bit.So far I've spent 10ish hours with them, it will be very interesting to see how they hold up over the coming months.

$REVIEW.: I'm always leery when upgrading computers, especially when you're going to replace an original component. Especially older computers where one component doesn't meet the latest standard that you weren't aware of, or upgrading one component doesn't help because there's another bottleneck with one of the other components. You know the drill - all of a sudden you're up a creek without a paddle and nothing works, you can't connect to the internet, can't even boot sometimes. What should be a 10 minute upgrade in many cases turns into 4+ hours, in many cases because of some little issue that wasn't clearly explained or documented.In this case, upgrading to the Intel Pro/1000 GT Gigabit NIC in my 2004 era Dell Dimension 4600 REALLY WAS only 10 minutes. Very easy, no hassles. Well, actually 30 minutes because I'm paranoid and read these reviews for advice before actually pulling the switch.Here's the drill (Dell Dimension 4600 with original on-board 10/100 NIC, running XP Pro):1.) Make sure you have the driver CD that came with the package ready.2.) Unplug the power from your computer (and disconnect all other devices so you can open the box).3.) Open the computer, remove the back cover plate from 1 of the empty PCI slots (you do have 1 empty PCI slot right?), and then shove this network card (firmly) into the PCI slot. Screw it down with the screw from the cover plate (that you can now throw away).4.) Close the computer and plug everything back in (remember to plug your ethernet wire into your brand new Gigabit NIC (not the old one), LOL.5.) Turn on your computer. After Windows has loaded, etc., insert the driver CD that came with the package and let it do its thing. It will automatically find the new hardware and install the appropriate driver.6.) Voila, you're done!*NOTE:  I did NOT have to de-activate, disable, or do anything with the original on-board 10/100 NIC.Now I surf at noticeably faster speeds! I noticed an improvement in internet performance when I upgraded my router and switch to Gigabit, and now a big jump in speed as soon as I installed this Gigabit NIC. Next step is to upgrade my internet service from 25 Mbps to 100Mbps now that my infrastructure is ready! I suspect once I upgrade all my computers to 2012 era machines I'll see even greater speeds.If you have doubts like I did about whether this upgrade can help speed up your internet, don't worry it definitely makes things faster. Even with 2004 - 2006 era PC's, as long as all of your other components are Gigabit ready, you WILL notice a definite improvement when surfing the net. In fact, for $30 I'm going to upgrade the NIC in all of my older computers.NOTE that my current network includes a Gigabit router, Gigabit switch, and Cat 5 (4 pair) cabling. So everything is Gigabit ready. And yes you do get Gigabit network speeds over Cat 5 cable - as long as you have good 4 pair Cat 5 and all connections are terminated properly. You may not get quite as good performance as Cat 5e or 6 if you have a lot of electrical interference or very long runs, but for almost all home applications your Cat. 5 wire will give you a Gigabit network just like Cat 5e or Cat 6.
$review_summary.: EASY Upgrade - Definitely speeds up old computer system!

$REVIEW.: I have several mp3 players and I had yet to find one suitable for everyday use until I picked this little gem up.My requirements were:-LONG battery life with replaceable battery (those embedded batteries are going to need factory servicing after 250-300 charge cycles...you can use rechargeable AA or AAAs and easily replace them)-Color screen...more than 256 colors.-USB 2.0 transfer-Ability to drag and drop-Ability to play OGG files-FM tuner-FM recorder-Solid constructionI have another unit I use for in-line recording, so that wasn't a big deal to me.  I came across this unit for a good price so I gave it a shot.  Well, at first, I was upset because I couldn't get the player to be recognized under Windows.  I called iRiver and a tech walked me through the steps of setting up the appropriate user account and permission in the registry.  After that, I hooked in and updated the firmware.This syncs with Windows Media Player 10 and does so seamlessly.  You can set it to sync up automatically or manually and WMP10 can convert to 64kbps wma files to save space if you want.  I updated the firmware and transferred a couple of music files with WMP10-no sweat.  I then was able to open up the player and drag and drop files into it (requirement met!)  Next came the key part-SOUND.The sound on this unit is very good, even with the included earbuds.  I connected a pair of active noise cancelling headphones with big magnets and the SRS sound was FULL and RICH, even though I was just playing OGG files (remember to put those in the DATA folder, not the MEDIA folder!)  There's a lot of tweakability on sound, even though there are no user presets you can save to.  The screen is nice, if not really large, and it's easy to get the controls down once you've had a day to get used to them.The unit came with a sturdy armband and a necklace to connect to the T10's VERY well-secured lanyard clip.  Either choice is OK, but I prefer the armband because I am always afraid I'll drink a soda and spill some on the unit if it's hanging right below my mouth.The T10 has a good tuner and can record FM in nice quality.  I also found the voice recording to be good, if a little sensitive to body noise (if you touch the body while you record, it is very audible.)  The battery life is projected to be 45 hours (WHICH IS FANTASTIC!), so I use some AA NiMH spare batteries from my digital camera for power and I never have to worry about finding a plug when the power goes out.  In a pinch, alkalines work just fine, too.Let's review my requirements:-LONG battery life with replaceable battery *CHECK*-Color screen...more than 256 colors.*CHECK*-USB 2.0 transfer *CHECK*-Ability to drag and drop *CHECK*-Ability to play OGG files *CHECK*-FM tuner *CHECK*-FM recorder *CHECK*-Solid construction *CHECK*In short, this player has satisfied all my needs and done so with great style to boot.  I'd highly recommend it with the following warnings:-Getting it to connect with Windows initially might require a call to iRiver.-The unit is sort of chunky (it's kind of like a triangular prism) and will not slip into a pocket like a flat piece of cardboard.  You will probably need to use a bigger case or one of the two included carry options.-The design makes it hard to see the controls when wearing the armband on the left arm.  Wearing it on your right will allow you easy access to the controls.I'd DEFINITELY recommend this unit to ANYONE who needed a great player that didn't need line-in recording.

Battery life is better than my other SW portables.  The wall charging feature of the included rechargeable batteries is great.  Convenience and &#34;feel&#34; is fine.  Not a big radio, so it fits in a suitcase with no issues.  Nice included case too.  Overall, very satisfied.

$REVIEW.: This is the real thing; a bona fide Panasonic brand camera battery.  It is more expensive than the off-brand replacement batteries, but it should work seamlessly with all Panasonic cameras that use this model battery.

Apparently, the Panasonic cameras will recognize off-brand batteries and will not accept them in an effort to protect us, the dumb consumers, from fires and explosions caused by off-brand batteries.I am not happy that I have to pay a premium for this brand-name battery, but it seems to be the only battery that will work with my Panasonic camera (unless, of course, you hack the camera's firmware).

$review_text.: First, these are not intended for loud places. You should be using these for a study, or library reading etc- not in a busy loud place. These are in no way intended for blocking noise- you will end up turning them up loud, and hurt your ears. But anyway, these are nice. Found em via Cnet. Easily fold up, but don't realy fit in the bag- i never have really needed it. As for comfort, you can't even tell they are there. As for sound- great highs, and not bad lows- all around goodness. Lifetime warranty was the selling point for me- i have already gone through about 10 or so pairs of the cheap skull candies- i would rather have something i could depend on. Just 9 or so bucks to ship and a new pair- i haven't had to do it yet, but it is there when i need it. All and all, awesome.

$REVIEW.: The kit lens with XSi is pretty wide angle, so no one should really expect to get a large hood on the lens, but the lens also has a very small manual focus ring, and this can help out by adding a little grip.  It doesn't offer a whole lot of protection from accidental dings and stray fingers, but it is better than nothing.  As the title of this review sounds, the hood does a better job making the lens looks better than it does reducing lens flare.  If you have the 20 dollars, its worth it, I suppose.  I never use lenses without a hood.

Would be better with satellite. I have it hooked to my stereo system and the sound is very impressive. The sound through the speakers is what I would expect from a TV. I have the USB by Samsung for my info link and it works good. Not really sure why I paid $80.00 dollars for a few graphics about the weather, but I was curious.I purchased a Linksys wireless game adapter so I could download the latest firmware and eventually hook up to a blu-ray system.All in all I am very pleased with my purchase.

$review_text.: Since I've been keyboarding for such a long time, I thought transitioning to an iPad would be simple--not so. Typing on glass is awkward, and while it works for short items, it is painful for any writing of substance. Even this review, brief as it is, would be too much for me to undertake on glass.Enter the AmazonBasics keyboard! It arrived in a simple-to-open box, and though instructions are included, I never needed them. Pop in the supplied batteries; pair with the iPad; type. The keys have a nice travel and are manageably spaced. Overall, this is a valuable addition to my iPad.If I were to make any improvements, I would recommend Amazon consider offering this in white--but not to match the Apple white scheme. Rather, I find that black lettering on white keys is easier on my eyes. The markings on these black keys is fairly faint and doesn't show well in low lighting conditions. And for those who wish Amazon had offered a case, I can highly recommend the use of a large Zip-Loc bag. (The plastic bag in which the keyboard arrived also works okay!)

$REVIEW.: In a world where lame reality shows now make up the majority of cable TV programming, Fake TV is a godsend because it makes no false claims about the veracity of the content you (and potential burglars) will be watching


Among the benefits: it uses far less energy than a "real" TV; it's silent -- no babbling hosts or MAXIMUM VOLUME IMPORTANT COMMERCIAL MESSAGES; and it turns itself on at dusk and off after a preconfigured time


It also costs less than a month of cable TV or DVD rentals (assuming the usual late fees).I love Fake TV because I can "set it and forget it." As far as my neighbors know, I'm consuming the required amount of televised drivel every night

As far as the burglars can tell, there's an unknown number of "Bros" in the living room watching PPV MMA or WWE just itching to try out some of the cool moves they just saw on anyone dumb enough to enter an occupied residence


And I can surf the web in the other room without missing anything entertaining or informative.As other reviewers have doubtless advised, placement is important


Draw the curtains so outsiders see just the play of lights in the room rather than the device itself
Check the effect from outside to see if it's doing what it needs to do.If it fails as a crime deterrent, I can always use it as a quack medical device for balancing engrams or erasing unwanted chakras


I wonder if anyone's interested in doing a reality show about that...

$review_text.: I got this product to power a flashlight that cost 1/3 as much as this product.  The flashlight has not arrived yet. So no report on how the batteries fit, or how long they last.  I have no other devices which could handle their voltage.  Without knowing the performance or durability of the batteries, 3 stars is all I can give initially.I put my calipers on a regular AA battery.  50mm long exactly and just under 13mm diameter.  These Ultrafire 14500s measure 51mm and just under 13mm diameter.  The (+) protruding nipple is 1mm long on the 14500, and 2 mm long on the eveready alkaline AA.The batteries I received  say  TR 14500 1200mah 3.7vThe batteries in the photo say LC 14500 900mah 3.6vFirst thing I noticed upon removal from the package, is there is no directions, no documentation.  Not a huge deal, not like one cannot figure it out.The other thing I noticed is that it appears upside down compared to other AA chargers.  As oriented in the photo, the AC prongs swing out from the bottom. They do not really swing out with authority and snap into place with a nice click.  Who knows how many swing cycles they are good for. The prongs are both the same size so it can hang upside down too, fit into the outlet in either orientation.  The design of the housing on mine varies slightly from the photo, which shows 900mah batteries/Inside one of the recesses for the batteries it says "FORBIDS TO INVERT".  The other recess, some Chinese Symbols. The letters are not super noticeable.I wonder what would happen if the battery was installed with reverse polarity, will it just not work, or will it release the magic blue smoke?  Nowhere does it say reverse polarity protected.As others noticed, when a battery is installed, a green light goes on, sooo, so much for storing these batteries in the charger.  When plugged into an outlet the light then goes red.  When plugging in a regular AA battery, the light does not illuminate, So I can understand the reason for the green light when installing a 14500 battery when the unit is not plugged into the outlet. It is just showing you that you have indeed chosen the right battery to attempt to charge, not your ancient NIcad or NiMH's you forgot about in your drawer.I check the voltage of both batteries before plugging them in to charge.  3.73 and 3.79 volts.  I plugged them in and the light turned  dark Amber colored.  After a half hour or so, it was still amber and I removed the batteries and both read 4.07 volts, and I returned them to the charger and plugged it back in.  Not sure when the light turned green, but it did, and the batteries both read 4.22 Volts.The Specs on the back of it say :Input AC100-240v 50/60hz max150mAOutput DC 4.2v---650mAhThe unit did not feel very warm when I removed the batteries, and my IR gun when they were 4.02 volts said the hottest temperature was 86 degrees F in 72 ambient.I'll try and remember to update when the flashlight arrives and I get an idea of battery life/longevity

$REVIEW.: EDIT: Since my original review, I have noticed my drives overheating on long (3-4 hour multi-hundred gig) backups, which causes them to go into a "safe mode" and stop the data transfer
Others have noted this as well


It's mainly due to poor air circulation


I have since put a small desk fan on the table, pointed at the drives and all has been well since

I have taken a star off my review due to this issue, but still love the unit nonetheless

Most shouldn't run into this trouble as I really hammer the drives(a WD 2tb Green and a Seagate 2tb) with backup duties.I was trying to consolidate all the crap on my desk and thought this would be a great start


Installation was easy peasy
Plug the power supply in, plug my (2) 2tb drives (One Western Digital Green and one Seagate Barracuda LP), plug the SATA cable in and presto! Both show up in My Computer!I have a Gateway 6860FX laptop and am apparently blessed with the ability to use both drives over SATA, simultaneously
I copied a bunch of files between the two with no issue whatsoever


I couldn't be happier!This is a great little external dock which works exactly as it should.

$REVIEW.: I bought this player because I had an Creative Zen before, and I liked it.  Somehow I lost my old player, and after looking around I just decided to buy the latest version of the same thing.It's still a good basic MP3 player with a nice price, and I like being able to use an SDHC card to easily expand the memory.  However, the Creative Zen X-Fi is largely the same thing as the older Zen, but with a bunch of small problems added.  Problems being:- The software is even worse.  However, it's easy to ignore this problem.  I just copy MP3s and videos in Windows Explorer anyway, I don't touch the Creative software.- Button placement is not as good.  The power switch on the back means I have to pick it up if I want to unlock the player, which I have to do if I want to fast forward or change the volume or so forth.  Locking the player is the only way to turn off the screen, so this is a regular thing to do, and should have been kept accessible.  Additionally, I liked the directional pad it had before, rather than the array of 9 buttons.- Useless new features.  X-Fi wastes the batteries and is cheesy, I turned it off and don't touch it.  The Wi-Fi idea is pointless.  It would have been cool if it could check Internet radio, but it can't.- Battery life doesn't seem improved.  It was pretty good before, but the other MP3 players have gotten better and better since then.- Video inconvenient.  I never really want to watch a movie off a 2.5" screen.  But if you do, it has to be 320x240 (no odd-size formats, which apparently the Zen M could view).  By the way I make my conversions with the Hamster Video Converter, it's free & easy.  Just set it to encode a 320x240 avi with Xvid-ASP.- Still poor integration of SD card.  Not the end of the world but kind of annoying.  Music cuts off if you even load up the SD card option.- Thicker.  If the old player was the size of three credit cards stacked up, the new one is the size of four credit cards stacked up.  Obviously it's not a huge difference, but it's too bad they couldn't have made it even slimmer.The one thing I like more about the X-Fi is the built in speaker.  It sounds like a cheap transistor radio, but it's still sort of cool.

$review_text.: Okay, like some other reviewers, I had a frustrating experience getting this anti-glare screen protector installed properly on my Kindle Fire. When you buy this three-pack, figure they are giving you two hands-on lessons in how to install it! (Considering I paid over twice as much for just one Zagg screen protector for my Kindle 2, the price for this Fosmon product is still very reasonable.) I had read all the reviews and warnings before I began, and I still ruined my first two.First, who lives in a "dust-free environment"? You have to be very careful. You should first shake any dust off the protector itself; after I'd failed to install the first two, I used one of the wipes that came with them to wipe down both sides of my last protector to clear it of all packing dust that it arrived with. Then clean your Fire screen, including the cracks around the sides of the screen. Clean it again. And again.My first effort went very well until I went to remove the #2 (face) plastic. I didn't realize I had to very slowly pull up on the tab to get the top piece started coming away from the actual shield protector before pulling&mdash;so I pulled the whole thing off! One down, two to go. On my second effort, I didn't quite get the protector perfectly positioned so I had a very slight overlap on the right-hand side, resulting in a large unattached area. Unusable. The third time, I folded the #1 plastic down halfway, just so I could hold the protector flat above my Fire and not touch the actual protector (to avoid fingerprints), edged the upper right corner in perfectly straight, anchored it across the top, and then let the protector kind of glide itself onto the screen as I pulled off the remaining #1 plastic. I had some larger bubbled areas, but I did not try to use the little cardboard piece to squeegee them out; I used my thumbs to press outward toward the nearest edge. This gave me a near-perfect installation. I carefully removed the #2 plastic, slipped my Fire back into itsrooCASE Dual-View Multi Angle (Black) 100% Genuine Leather Leather Folio Case Cover for Amazon Kindle Fire 7-Inch Android Tablet, tucked one of the little squares of screen-cleaning cloth behind the Fire for later cleaning use if needed, and it was all good to go.After regularly fighting the glare from my Kindle Fire, it took me a little while for my eyes to adjust to the difference with the anti-glare shield protector in place, but I LIKE it! Reading is now easier on my eyes, and myGreatShield 2-in-1 Ballpoint Pen and Capacitive Touchscreen Stylus for Amazon Kindle Fire Tabletseems to be working with more precision than it was before. Despite the hassles, I do recommend this product and I'm glad I've got it.

$review_text.: I got a pack of these because I ran into a job where whoever dropped the cables before did the typical "bad wiring job" with the ends leaving a half inch of unsheathed CAT5e cable...at least they got the specification right...Anyway, snip, rip, set, crimp all in less than 30 seconds!These are so nice, totally worth the price premium.  They have an open end that the cables can go through to let you get a tight fit on the cable, and allow you to arrange the pairs with no problems.  The open slot is also grooved to hold the cable in line as high quality standard connectors have.I also purchased Platinum Tools EZ-RJPRO HD Crimp Tool along with these, which has a flush cut cutter on the crimp end to cut off the extra wire that is poking through.Finally, these standard bootsRJ45 Blue Strain Relief Boots (50 Pcs Per Bag)here work perfectly fine.

$REVIEW.: The Ray Flash was commented on PhotoshopTV and mentioned on photography sites on the net

 So I knew going into this that I would lose at least a stop when using this product


 The issue I have is the value of the product


 Granted, photography is not cheap by any means, but this is a piece of injected plastic being sold for a significantly disproportionate amount from the benefits the product provides


 I did try it; it was flimsy, hard to keep on the flash, and just awkward
 If you are handy and don't mind losing a stop, check out some of the online tutorials to make your own ring flash adaptor, otherwise I would recommend (granted double the cost of the Ray Flash) Alien Bees Ring Flash which you can use as a ring flash or purchase the soft box add on to turn it into a great studio soft box

 I returned my Ray Flash and am picking up the Alien Bees Ring Flash..


I would get more value out of it, than I would have if I kept the Ray Flash.

$REVIEW.: I'm no aficionado of audio equipment, but these buds surprised me.  I've been using the Jbuds 1st generation buds for the last few years because they were cheap and seemed to do a good enough job. They've each lasted me about 1-2 years.I decided to get the J3 version without any real expectations.  First off, when I put them in, they fit well - no fiddling around with different sized buds like the 1st gen.  I could feel them creating a comfortable seal which was also a new experience.  The 1st gen didn't really create a seal.  Then I plugged it into my iphone.  I was amazed to hear new details of songs that I've been listening to for more than a decade, like old Radiohead songs.  You hear everything.  It never occurred to me that I my audio experience was "less than" until now.  So sound-wise, I am pretty impressed.The case is a thoughtful addition. It's pretty small, fitting in the palm of your hand, but sturdy. The wires though are noticeably thinner than the 1st gen and look a lot more delicate. I am skeptical that they will last as long but I can't say for sure. So the case is a good thing if you're traveling with these buds. Still, even though these are pricier than the 1st gen buds, they're still relatively cheap.  Get them.

No problems so far, other than I initially had to slightly change my BIOS settings to make it work right, and had to install updated SATA drivers (but my PC is pretty old). Since then, it's worked like a charm, and I recommend this product.-1 star because the eSata comes loose too easily from the rear of the dock, and the cable could be longer. Also, there is no &#34;spin down&#34;; disk remains active/hot until you turn off the dock, which could be good or bad.  I always point a small fan at my external drives, just in case.

I don't think Im a person that watches a lot of TV. But Tivo helps me see the shows I want to see.  It gives me the ease of setting up a show or program to record no matter where Im located.  If I have access to the Internet I can schedule a show to record. The ease of use is what makes Tivo so great also.  Simple menus and help features.  But what I really think whAt makes Tivo great is there support.  In the few times I have called in for tech support everyone has been knowledgeable and very pleasant. Now days it's hard to find a company that believes in customer service but Tivo offers a great product and great customer service to back up there product. Try a Tivo I'm sure you'll like it too.

$REVIEW.: I bought these  headphones for our online training company, and what a mistake. They are much better for listening to music, gaming, or other activities because the &#34;microphone&#34; is built into one of the earphones and is crap. If you need a microphone built into your headphones, don't buy these. The other thing I hated was how big the earphones are. I think my ears are in the range of normal ears, and these earphones were huge. They were also fairly heavy. I felt like I was wearing a big pair of earmuffs. I tried them for listening to music on my laptop and the sound quality had a good range of bass, mid-tones, and treble. But I don't use them even for listening to music because they are just too big and heavy on me.

$REVIEW.: There have been a number of detailed reviews already. I will write mainly the items which I find notable.I have the Triathlon bundle, which seems overpriced. If you buy the watch itself, and then add the extender strap, cadence accessory, quick release kit &cycling; parts separately, it may come out cheaper than buying the bundle. The 310XT is available at a much lower price as of writing, although it is several years older technology. However, the functionality is pretty much the same.The soft heart rate strap that comes with the 910XT bundle is much better than the hard plastic strap that Garmin still sells. I see much less spiking in the HRM data.This watch is much, much smaller than the orange Garmin 310XT. The slimmer profile and the black color make it look thinner and almost wearable as a large watch. I don't know if the watch is worth its price, especially because it does not even have the most basic of watch functions (time, date, alarm).People interested in buying a GPS watch should be reminded that this unit does not even have a time screen by default. The user needs to set up time as one of the fields. With GPS off, the watch lasts about 50 hours. This is probably the most battery life that is achievable for this watch.Because it is not a watch, it does not even have simple watch features such as date or alarm. If you want to wear a GPS watch and need an alarm to wake up, this watch is not it. If you forget the day easily and want a watch with the date, this watch is not for you. On the other hand, you do get a time of sunrise and sunset feature, if that is important for athletes who are out for long days and want to make sure they know how much daylight there is.A number of users have reviewed that this unit does not give an accurate instant pace. I find that this is true, even with the most up-to-date firmware as of writing. When running, I have seen the pace fluctuate up to 2 minutes in a few seconds. For example, the pace goes from 6:35 min/mile to 8:35 min/mile. A few times, I have seen the instant pace go as fast as 2:30 min/mile.For indoor swimmers, it takes a bit getting used to using this watch, as the accelerometer can pick up movements of the arm and the watch will think the swimmer has finished a length when that has not happened. Or the watch can't figure out what is happening, and you get some weird data to analyze later on.The display can read up to four fields of data. However, I have found that with displaying 4 fields, the numbers become quite small, and reading the data is somewhat difficult when doing an activity.Having had this watch for a short period of time (it only came out in late 2011), I do not know how long the 910XT will last before it breaks. I have owned a number of Garmin GPS products. The most I have got out of a unit is 5 years before it stopped picking up satellites. Perhaps other Garmin owners have more experience on how long these units should last.If I did not want a GPS unit that is waterproof, and if I did only running, I would mainly use my other Garmin watch, which is lighter, smaller, and picks up satellites equally fast. Still, this watch is definitely worth a look, and is one of my favorite sport watches now. If only it had a longer battery life (in weeks rather than days), I could easily use it as an everyday watch.

$review_text.: We have a desktop tower hooked up to our tv and I wanted to be able to control it from the couch across our living room. I was worried about the range, but we've had no problems with using this. Even the special functions, which sometimes don't work when you buy a keyboard that isn't made specifically for your brand of computer, work great.

$REVIEW.: I just bought the Roku XDS for a number of reasons:1. I don't have an internet TV so some of the main apps were nice (Pandora, Amazon, etc)2. MLB channel.  I normally subscribe and have high hopes that they will stream in HD.  This will be much easier than connecting my computer my TV.3. USB port - I have a number of movies on my external HD and would like one connection so I can watch them without having to connect my computer to the TV again.My set-up was ok.  It didn't recognize my wireless router (Belkin N+ v1) and then somehow it did.  So it's fine now.My biggest frustration is that the USB port doesn't really work and is very limited.  It took a bit to find the "USB Channel" which only plays .mp4 and .m4v files but even those don't work all the time.  It's not even an official Roku supported channel.  There is suppose to be in update in January but why would you release a product that doesn't work 100%?  I'm also hoping that they work on the unit recognizing more file formats.It is a little odd there is not power button but I believe it has a very low power usage so it shouldn't be too bad.Pandora seemed ok...took a bit to load and I don't have a Netflix or Hulu account so I cannot comment on those.  Other than that the other channels offered are basically lower end channels that don't really add a lot of value.Once the usb port is fixed I'll update my review.

$REVIEW.: I had been using a Cambridge Soundworks Ensemble IV system for almost 10 years but recently started having some issues that I attributed to the small passive sub that was bundled with the satellites.  I was considering a new 10" Polk sub when good fortune landed the JBL Balboa SUB 10 onto my door step.PROS:- Easy to set up- Flexible controls- Sufficient power rating- Good sound- Nice cabinet appearance- Includes long subwoofer cableCONS:- Big (tall) size- May not be magnetically shieldedInstalling the Balboa SUB 10 was quick and easy.  I used the included subwoofer cable and plugged it into my Onkyo 5.1 receiver via the LFE input.  I threw in a few high action movies and a big smile came across my face.  My favorite scene to test a home entertainment system with is the opening scene in Saving Private Ryan.  Wow.  If you live in an apartment, don't even think about cranking this up.  I may end up buying a new subwoofer cable though because the included cable did not fit as tight as it probably should.Since the JBL Balboa SUB 10 is the first powered sub I have owned, I followed the recommendations by JBL and Onkyo for set up.  As time passes, I may fiddle a bit more with the phase switch and crossover.  I found the sound quality to be quite good and paired up surprisingly well with the Cambridge Soundworks satellites.  The SUB 10 easily outperformed the CS passive sub, which is no surprise.  I appreciate the auto on/standby feature and had no instances of "thumping" when coming back online.  Though I could find no mention of it in JBL documents, I believe the sub is NOT magnetically shielded.  The box had large warning stickers that warned freight carriers to not place the box too close to their instruments!I found the cabinet to be attractive enough for my decor and set it near my home entertainment center.  JBL describes the SUB 10 as having a slim profile and I guess that is true.  Most powered subs that I've seen are typically square, while the SUB 10 is more of a rectangle.  I didn't mind the size but when my wife got home, she asked me if I was keeping it.  "Yes honey, I'm keeping it."

$REVIEW.: I had been hesitant to order this because it looked hard to use. After using it for a week, I wished I had bought it sooner. Now, after using it for almost 3 months, I still love it and wouldn't want to use my computers without it. For years, I've used a full brace to keep my wrist aligned and prevent pain. It has worked very well for me and I considered it enough. This past summer, though, I overused my arms (not computer-related) and was having pain in my right forearm when I used my mouse for more than short periods, even with the wrist brace on. My sister recommended that I try an ergonomic mouse. After extensive searching and thinking, I bought this Lugulake mouse. I AM SO GLAD I DID! It makes a world of difference! It keeps my arm and wrist in a natural and comfortable position while I use it (my forearm is no longer rotated inward). I am able to use my mouse for long periods of time with no pain. (I have since recovered from the overuse injury I suffered earlier but still use the wrist brace). Lugolake did email me and say that it would feel differently and to give it a few days to get used to it, so I was prepared to spend some time before I was comfortable with it. It did feel weird in my hand at first because It's a completely different grip. But surprisingly, I got used to it much sooner than I had expected. The two buttons and the scroll wheel are on the right vertical, slightly curved side. The left vertical side of the mouse has a slight curve too and has a slightly textured grip that's soft on the hand. There's also a large indentation on that left side where my thumb rests. It looked too big for me when I got it and it's shaped funny, but it's actually a very good fit for my hand. I have medium size hands with large palm areas and my hand curls comfortably around this mouse. I can reach the 2 buttons and the scroll wheel easily, though it did take a day or so for my brain to manage the clicks and scrolls smoothly. I'm 57 years old and thought it would take me much longer to adapt to this new mouse, but I got comfortable with it in a few days and in a week, I loved it. The bottom is flat and wide and glides smoothly and easily over the mouse pad. My husband tried it a few times recently and was surprised how easy it was to use and how comfortable. Now he wants one too. He has much larger hands and the mouse fit his right hand very well too. Someone with small hands/short fingers might still be able to reach the buttons & wheel. Early on, there was a faint clicking sound when I moved the mouse and scrolled the wheel, but that has disappeared completely. I bought the black/silver one so it's basic but extremely functional. Would have loved a purple one. But this one has a cool blue light that shines through the scroll wheel.  It might be distracting in a dark bedroom, but my pc is in a separate room and I turn it off every night so it's not an issue. This was money well spent. It's so light and comfortable! It's very sturdy and well built and should last for a long time. I absolutely love my Lugulake mouse! I am going to buy another or maybe two, so I can make sure I always have one for my pc and one for my laptop. Bravo! to the designer and this company. The Lugulake customer service was superior - they offered guidance and support. I would give this mouse and them 10 stars if Amazon would allow it.

$review_text.: I'm still waiting for my screen protectors to come in, but so far I think this case is awesome. It makes my Zune 120 look great, while providing it maximum protection. The provided belt clip is a nice extra benefit as well. I agree that it does attract (and grab) every piece of dust that comes close to it, but a simple paint brush works just fine for me to remove the dust, dirt, and lint. My only complaint is that I can no longer dock my Zune to my iHome ZN9 clock radio with the cover on. I have to take the cover off each time I want to dock it there, and I don't really want to do that if I can help it. So that is my only difficulty with this cover, but I'll figure something out.

$REVIEW.: So I purchased because my Droid Charge eats batteries whenever I use it for anything long term, using the GPS it will last less than 30 minutes, sometimes on a walk I will want to pull up a map or use the pedometer feature to see how far I have gone, well then it just dies, now I can just stick the iTorch in my pocket and charge my phones 1600ma battery several times.The iTorch uses the same cable to charge it as i use to charge my phone so it is perfect for me.  The flashlight is really nice as it is pretty bright and being a LED it should last for hours the red led is useful if you have a cat or dog that will chase the light, the smalls pouch is a good size.Overall I am pretty impressed it is much better and last longer than the cheapo external batteries  and a much better value than the higher priced ones you can also find online.

This device is at best more a relay system seemingly one block of data at a time.  While on VOIP I'd hear a few words followed by pause while it caught up.  Apparently it doesn't broadcast in full duplex and it showed.  No use to me.  Back it went.

I picked this one out entirely because it was the cheapest I could find, and I wasn't expecting much.Turns out this is an excellent keyboard though! The layout it nice, the aesthetics are pleasing, and the key action is incredibly satisfying.I like chiclet keyboards because they're so much easier to clean, but have always been slightly dissatisfied with how most of them feel. This one doesn't even feel like a chiclet keyboard though, it almost feels like a mechanical switch, and also makes an excellent sound.If they ever make a wireless version of this keyboard I'll take three!

(Being honest, for 30 bucks I was not expecting much, but still...)  I'm using these indoors in a not-so quiet place (in a lab-type environment) for "background music" from the radio (my 35+ year old Pioneer SX-434 tuner which sounds pretty darn good through these BTW).

$review_text.: If you are looking for some basic plastic storage cases for your SDHC or SDXC flash cards, it's hard to go wrong with this set of ten cases for six dollars
You have to wonder why not every flash card is supplied with a case, but since they aren't (even some of the more expensive cards are not), these cases at 60 cents a piece are great


The quality of them seems in line with the cases that are sometimes supplied with the various memory card brands, and the set comes &#34;flattened&#34; out (i.e., you have to bend the cases along the hinge when using them for the first time) in a small zip lock bag.It's not the most exciting item to have to purchase, but if you need them, you need them, and this inexpensive set is hard to beat.

$REVIEW.: I was excited to try this set: I am on my computer a lot, and have issues with my wrists at times, as well as my right hand in general (I broke my thumb a few years ago and it still flares up). So I was eager to see if I could get some relief.The short answer: yes and no. On the ergonomic front, I LOVE the keyboard. I find it extremely comfortable and the split design is extremely comfortable. The keys themselves are extremely short-throw - much like some laptop keyboards I've used, and the combination of that, the slight raise in the middle and the wrist pad make this thing incredibly comfortable for long stints at the keyboard.On the downside, I do NOT like the switchable function keys - I want to be able to use, for example, F5 without having to flick a switch that disables the media controls. And on THAT topic, not only are there no skip forward/skip back keys, there's no way to bind those functions to keys that I don't use, like volume up and down (I have a separate audio interface with volume control). So that stuff is a drag. Thankfully, there's a dedicated calculator key (tow actually, one on the keyboard and one on the number pad), but no shutdown or sleep keys and, again, no way to program a macro for those functions.Still though, despite missing those functions, I find the comfort alone is enough to carry the day for me. The keyboard isn't perfect, but it feels so good I'm still using it.The separated number pad is a wash: I like the compact size on the main keyboard, but I don't like reaching for the number pad when I need it, and keeping it parked next to the keyboard can leave it in the way of the mouse. It looks cool though, so that's (a small) something.For me, it's the mouse that's the big letdown here. I was happy to give it a shot, despite it looking HUGE, but it never got comfortable for me. Part of that is because the the design rotates your hand a bit outward - nice in theory, since your hand naturally does that, but in use it places the weight of my hand and arm directly and exclusively on a the large carpal at the bottom-outside edge of my palm, right above the wrist crease. I found the pressure irritating after a short time, and retired the mouse after a week or two of hanging in there hoping for improvement.So for me, it's a fail on ergonomics - what about functionality? Well, the mouse has two main buttons and a wheel on top, plus the Windows button (in blue) and a thumb button. The wheel scrolls up/down and right/left, plus is clickable. But programming choices are limited; in fact, the blue Windows one has none at all: it opens the start menu in Windows 7 and goes to the desktop in Windows 8. Not good enough at this level, sorry.As for wireless connectivity, this brings up what I think is a huge missed opportunity: it's not Bluetooth. So right off the bat, you're forced to use a (thankfully) low-profile dongle to connect - absurd in a world of Bluetooth-enabled laptops.Worse, though, it still suffers from the same shortcoming as every wireless desktop set I've ever tested: lag and dropouts. I still run into issues where the mouse is dead for a second before jumping around, or the keypad doesn't recognize a button press (a BIG drag when you're using a calculator to add columns of numbers and it misses a digit-press). The only good news here is that when things get laggy, a quick unplug/replug of the dongle cures it. But it shouldn't happen at all. Again, not good enough, Microsoft.So in the end, there's a great keyboard on my desk that looks beautiful and feels quite nice. It has some issues, and the mouse is useless to me - but the comfort of the thing means I'm still not going back to either of my other two main keyboards (a top of the line Logitech and an older mechanical key MS). Yet.

$REVIEW.: The Good:* Excellent key response; I normally dislike chiclet keyboards, but the keys feel good.* No need for charging or battery replacement so far.* Linux-compatible with minimal trouble (but check "The Ugly" for more details on this).* Flip-out legs to elevate the back of the keyboard; nice to see that in a wireless keyboard.The bad:* Absolutely horrid key placement.  For example, the Enter key is vertical - occupying the "QWER" and "ASDF" rows, rather than only the "ASDF" row like a normal keyboard; the backslash/pipe key is then placed in the home row instead of the row above where it should be.  There is literally zero reason for this (the Anker equivalent to this keyboard at least makes the Enter key wide *and* needlessly tall; this is simply double-annoying).  Same goes for the left Shift key, which - instead of being nice and wide like on a normal keyboard - is shortened and instead replaced with *another* backslash/pipe key between it and the Z key.  Yes, because I *totally* need not just one, but *two*, backslash keys on my keyboard instead of my keyboard layout being, you know, sane.  On the plus side, at least now typing out long command pipelines and escaping special characters in a bash shell might be marginally easier, though at the expense of relearning how to touch-type thanks to the absolutely-horrid layout.***NOTE: this is different from what the photos in the Amazon listing display; the photos are not accurate.  Be prepared to get used to pinky extensions as you try to type normally.The Ugly:* The backside is a bit slick, making it tricky to type while the keyboard is on your lap.* If you're a Linux user looking to use this keyboard in conjunction with a mouse via the Unifying Receiver, you will probably need to install an additional program on your computer to replace Logitech's software, which is only available for Windows and OS X.  The Arch Linux folks have some good documentation on said Unifying Receiver at [...] I'm using ltunify, which works like a charm: just run 'ltunify pair' (without the quotes) and switch the keyboard off/on.  Solaar handles this with a graphical interface, which is probably easier if you're not comfortable with the command line.

$review_text.: I bought this unit as a replacement for one of my Back-UPS 1500 (not Pro) units. My only beef with this unit is the outlet configuration. The old units had 8 outlets, 6 with battery protection and 2 surge only, which I never used anyway. The new unit has 10 outlets, 5 battery protected and 5 surge. So effectively it has one fewer usable outlets. Since I am powering 2 computers, monitors, speakers and networking equipment, this means I am short one outlet. Plus only a couple outlets have ample space to attach bulky DC adapters. Other than that I love the new unit much better. I am glad they ditched the single multi-function button of the old units in favor of a three-button configuration. On the old units I was afraid to mute the alarm for fear of accidentally powering off. On the new unit, the mute button is separate, plus powering off requires the power button to be held down 2 seconds, and it's recessed, making an accidental power-off unlikely. I like the LCD display function plus the ability to manage UPS configuration settings without having to install Power-Chute, which doesn't run on Linux anyway.

$REVIEW.: Initially I was pleased with this product as it had several features the old Garmin did not, such as the ability to search for a POI in a specific city or near my planned route

However, after a few months I realized that it does not show the address when you select a POI (but it does show the phone number and URL, which is less useful when you're driving)
So when you're trying to find a Costco in Pasadena (for example) you have no way to know exactly where it is until you select it

I found out online that TomTom removed the addresses from the POI database to make more room
Terrible decision which would have prevented me from buying another.A couple of days ago the TomTom failed completely


It will no longer get a satellite signal, no matter how long I wait
I've tried it at the top of a mountain, in a broad valley, even on a south facing beach

Nothing


It's less than a year old
I will not buy another TomTom

It's back to Garmins for me.

$REVIEW.: If all you need is a case for your basic Alpha with the basic lens kit then, this is it. In fact, it's perfect.What you get is the main compartment with sufficient room to fit your camera comfortably and 2 small side compartments where you could keep... I don't know... maybe an extra battery, a memory card and some change for the tolls. You also get a shoulder strap and a handle on the top of the case. I found them both useful.We had bought this case from Amazon about 5 months ago and we used it on 2 vacations (4 weeks) away from home as well as on several other weekend outings. The case is easy to carry and provides all the protection your camera needs save for some very heavy object crushing down on it or dropping it into deep water - it is NOT water-proof.Carrying my Alpha in this case gives me peace of mind and the case is pretty too, for a camera carrying case, that is.______________________________________Note (June 24, 2009):I just received my SECOND case. The first one was lost while on vacation. Thankfully, it was just the case and a couple of cables and not the camera.I am adding this note only to testify that I was happy enough with this case to reorder the exact same model even though there are alternatives available and, sadly, it is more expensive now than it was the first time around.Obviously, I maintain my initial 5-star rating.

$review_text.: This earns 3 stars as being a really cool quadracopter with a video camera.  If I were to do it all over again though, I'd seriously consider a Spectrum DX6 + a Blade MQX.- 1 star for poor app support- 1 star for usb stick problem, low quality "720p" video, no sound recordings, and no R/C transmitter support1.  On the side of box, there are apps like Flying Ace and AR.Hunter which are no longer in the app store.  Imagine if you bought an XBox and then MS pulled Halo before you had a change to buy it.2. Support:  I emailed Parrot to ask for an explanation, but they simply say they are not contractually obligated to keep apps in the store with no timeline as to when they might return.3. USB Drive Problem:  I bought 2 16GB PNY USB drives.  Neither is recognized by the Drone.  Very frustrating.4. Video:  The 720p front video is terrible for being "HD".  The bottom camera is even worse.5. No sound recording:  Do you like silent videos?  Neither do I.  I wish the drone had a mic that at least captured a little of the whir of the blades.6. Joypad control: I have not found a great way to control the Drone compared to RC helicopter transmitters.  Controlling a RC anything with an iPhone/iPad is cool in theory, but in reality, it's more frustrating to learn.  It can be done especially if you are in your teens and have hours to practice, but 2 joysticks are much better than smearing your thumbs around glass.  I even tried the Fling Mini, and it's almost worse than thumbs on screen._____If you are going to buy a drone, I highly recommend a Blade MQX.  The novelty of the junky video wears off quickly, and the apps are more frustration to get working than they are fun.

$review_text.: Via the Amazon Vine review program, I selected something I was in the market for already... an iPad case.  I was able to get the Acme Made Slick Case for iPad (Matte Black), and I found it's a solid, basic iPad case without many frills, but that does what it should.  The outer shell is a neoprene case that is perfect for protecting against liquids and other types of messes.  Inside, it uses a spongy felt-like material to prevent any scratching.  The tactile feel of both parts is comfortable and pleasant, and it just feels like it would protect against typical scrapes and close calls.Internally, the Slick Case has a pouch on one side and four elastic corner straps on the other side.  If you're not going to be using the iPad, slipping it into the pouch portion adds another level of protection regardless of whether the case is open or closed.  The other side would be used if you're going to want to unzip the case and start using the iPad right away.  The straps hold the iPad securely without interfering with the screen at all.  My only question would be how long the straps will keep their elasticity.  I'm not expecting it to be a problem, but you never know.  The strap placement doesn't score quite as high when it comes to using the small controls on the edge of the iPad, as it partially covers them.  You can press through the fabric, and you really don't spend a lot of time using the controls anyway, but it is a bit of a design quirk.  When the case is zipped up, I found the size to be fine.  Obviously it adds some bulk due to the padding, but I didn't think it was excessive.Probably the two things that I find lacking or not quite as advertised have to do with the inner pouch (for accessory storage) and the inability to have the case serve as a stand.  The product description says the inner pouch can be used to store cords and small accessories.  Cords, yes... but anything more or larger than the electrical plug-in would make for a lumpy case or something that was hard to zip up.  Just figure that you won't have much in the way of extra storage space here.  The lack of a case stand is a bit more irritating.  If you wanted to prop the screen up to watch a video, you wouldn't be able to with this case.  That's probably the one thing that I miss the most with this case, and the only reason I might caution someone if they were looking to buy one.  If it doesn't matter, then no big deal.  But just know that it doesn't have that feature.I don't think the Acme Made Slick Case for your iPad would be a bad purchase given the price point.  You could spend more and get more, or spend less and get (a lot) less.  But for basic protection that looks and feels nice, this case works.Disclosure:Obtained From: Amazon Vine Review ProgramPayment: Free

And I am glad I did, because my Zune is able to sync again and I love the little caps that come with it! This cable seems better built than the original cable, its longer and the end that connects to the Zune has no buttons, (which is how the original one broke!!!)You can go the cheaper route too, but this cable was worth the price (for a few dollars more, but still cheaper than the OEM price) and I expect many more years out of the Zune.

$REVIEW.: If you are looking for a convienient TRUE USB 3 reader (not just a USB 3 front port and a USB 2.0 reader for the cards as a lot of units are) this is a nice choice.  Today's high speed SDXC and etc. type cards are capable of far faster than USB 2.0 has to offer.Fit and finish is good, and plugged right into the USB 3 header on my Gigabyte mainboard.The only thing that took me for a loop was that by the way windows works you get several drive letters (one for each physical slot).  There is a free utility if you google for USB Drive Letter Control that will make sure only slots that really have a card in them will get a drive letter.  Problem solved.Speeds amazed me, especially emptying out a 32GB SDXC card to my SSD drive.  Works fine on Windows 7 and Windows 8.  Also able to boot from any of the slots as a USB boot device from BIOS if you are so inclined, so you could make your own Windows Install SD card, etc.  There is a single blue LED that comes on when there is at least a single card in the unit.  It is not blinding or annoying, and stays steadily lit, activity makes it flash.The front panel USB3 port has come in handy and works just as well with USB2 devices such as flash drives.  Doesn't seem like it will loosen up on me any time soon.  Spend the extra on this one - I think you will be surprised.

$review_text.: This remote is straightforward and I had it setup on the first try and controlling our units in under 10 minutes. Easily controlled multiple items and was less cluttered than the more expensive RCA remotes. By less cluttered I mean the keypad is a little simpler than some other RCA and more expensive remotes. (Seems like the more "features" they put on these remotes the smaller the keys and harder to use)I bought the RCA RCRN04GR for the main purpose of a replacement remote for our Roku 3. I point this out in the headline due to the incredibly difficult time I had finding any compatible remotes for roku online despite an hour of research, as of this writing!... So I hope this review helps someone on that same journey. It has everything the roku remote has except no dedicated back button (there are workarounds) and it's not a motion remote control so you can't play the roku games. For all else it works great, even has a home key that functions same as roku home key, a must for a universal remote to be used with roku. Since you can't control TV volume in your roku remote, having that on this universal remote is a nice plus. And it comes with a light up keypad button, hit the button and most of the remote keys illuminate.This remote has the roku codes included in the manual, so you don't have to search for them!... just plug in the numbers and you're golden.Can't go wrong for the price.I did deduct one star due to the directional arrows are a little harder pressing than I'd like, and most of the remote buttons are tinier than I'd like. Other than that it rocks for less than $15 at a local electronics store.Hope this helps someone and thanks for reading.

I have ended up reading a section of a website and attempt to scroll, but I am unable until I move the mouse first, and it can do it with as little as 10 seconds of non-use.As for construction quality, the door covering the battery housing seems a little flimsy - especially the two tabs that slide under the main part of the mouse itself when it snaps closed.  The two little tabs seem rather thin, as though they could break if the battery door is not inserted exactly as it is supposed to be.Otherwise, it is very responsive and works great.

It is a heavy pad that seems to stick to the dash board without any kind of glues or adhesives.  The rubber pad and the weight make it kind of freeze into place.  If you have a Garmin, this is not a bad item to get.  The mount that comes with a Garmin mounts to the front windwhield, the problem with that is, you either leave it in place telling criminals that you have a Garmin or it leaves a ring on the glass telling them the same thing.

But, given the performance boost I've experienced with Windows 7 on my Dell Latitude D830, the money was quite well spent and I have absolutely no regrets - it was worth every penny.I've installed several of these professionally (64 GB and 128 GB M4's), and it's true that it will breathe life back into a [Windows Vista or Windows 7] computer that you've thought had already seen better days.  My laptop (the D830 with m4 installed a year ago) is 6 years old, but I still routinely process 15 meg Canon RAW DSLR images using Photoshop (with Bridge open, as well as Photomatix from time-to-time) and am happy with the performance.

$review_text.: People will probably blast me for being a noob, but here goes. The last Madden game I played was Madden '92 on the Sega Genesis (yes, I bought it new back in '91). I'm more of a PC gamer these days. Anyway, I got my 7 year old son a Wii U for Christmas and, since we're big football fans, we decided to get Madden '13. Here's my biggest complaint: the developers just assume people have a familiarity with their games and controls and, therefor don't even bother with a tutorial of any kind.None.How do you kick? Tackle? Do anything? Who knows? Well, the internet, thankfully. It seems rather than include a tutorial, they just say &#34;if someone wants to know how to play, they can do an internet search to figure it out&#34;. Way to welcome new players into your franchise!Including a simple tutorial mode explaining the basics would have made learning the game much more enjoyable. I don't need to know all the controls (stiff arms, juke, etc...) just the basics.Pros:- I like how, if you're playing single player or two players on one team, it shows you where you're running the ball. That helps my 7 year old.- I like how my son can pick &#34;Rookie&#34; experience and I can pick &#34;All-Pro&#34; and I don't have to let him win. It adjusts to our skill levels.- Once you figure out the basic controls, you can get by with any skill level.Cons:No tutorialLogging into EA every stinking time (I usually just cancel out of it and play exhibition).Manual is useless (off to the internet with you!). Why bother to include one? Just have a piece of paper that says &#34;go to this web site for manual&#34;.If you like football, this is really your only option. The game isn't really all that bad once you get by the initial frustration. Lucky for EA they have the only officially licensed NFL product or people wouldn't put up with this kind of thing.

$REVIEW.: Wanted a new case that could hold my iPad in landscape mode that didn't obscure any of the front. When I saw 500+ 5 star reviews, I knew that this was a good choice. This item fits the bill and works perfectly! Snaps right it, took maybe 5 seconds; you have to put one side in and then the other, not just straight down to snap. Nice range of viewing angles and looks like it will take some light abuse! Very happy so far!

$review_text.: I was running the TaoTronics MK005 on my Raspberry Pi and it was moving in the opposite direction of where i was going. hahaWhen I first got it out of the box, the L button , when pressed was not making any clicky sounds like all the other keys. The clicky sound helps when you are typing and you know you actually clicked it.On Windows 7, this runs flawlessly, and is quick.On the Raspberry Pi, since the processor is soo slow at 700mega hertz, moving around the mouse was a big pain but doable. Overclocking it to 900 mega hertz helped make it a bit faster and it was a better experience.This style of navigating the computer is very similar to the wii.TaoTronics- i have a curious suggestion of maybe putting the mouse sensor facing the direction the keyboard is facing. Just a suggestion, I do not know if it would be any better or work, but i have gotten a little used to moving the orientation of the keyboard and mouse back and fourth.A question, what happens if i Leave the batteries in? and not use it?The TaoTronics MK005 was sent for review purposes.edit 1/8/2014I am currently using the keyboard for watching movies on my projector, and my family thought the idea was great. Now, we are currently getting blackout fabric to use as a screen for the projector. The keyboard works fine, and can be used almost anywhere since you do not need a surface unlike a mouse.

$review_text.: You can get silicone sleeves for well under 10 bucks and that might be good enough for many people. But for me, the primary purpose of getting a case is protection. I really like the idea of having a rubber sleeve with an added hard cover.This quality case is well-designed and fits very tightly without the "squirminess" of a cheap silicone sleeve. The buttons do require more pressure to operate but it's not a big difference. I've seen at least one other brand that had cutouts for the buttons, but OB opted to add raised rubber nubs instead. Since there are two layers with this case system, cutouts might make the buttons too recessed to push easily. The notification LED is harder to see from most angles, but that will happen with nearly any case. The tricky horizontal speaker area at the front top edge is completely exposed, as is the rear speaker.The included screen protector fits fine and includes the required cutout for the proximity sensor. The touch sensitivity remains about the same with possibly a small increase in repeat taps. (There is an "oily sheen" coloration visible now at some light angles and only when the screen is dark, but it doesn't impact usability at all.) The ports for the earphones and the micro usb plug are covered with rubber flaps.As with any covering, there are some tradeoffs in ease of use that are necessary to gain the added protection. There is no way to protect the phone that doesn't add layers and thickness. I hope I never need to test the impact protection offered by this case, but I'm confident the added cost was well spent.

$review_text.: These are in ear monitor earbuds. They are designed to be worn with the cord looping around your ear and the earpeice resting within your ear canal, not straight down with the earpeice in the air. You essentially slid the cord around the back of your ear then rotate the earpiece 180 degrees so that the rubber tips fit into your ears.Most of the not so good reviews seem to be from folk wearing them incorrectly.See the picture below for an example of how to wear them.https://www.google.com/search?q=Monoprice+108320&oe;=utf-8&aq;=t&rls;=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client;=firefox-a&um;=1&ie;=UTF-8&hl;=en&tbm;=isch&source;=og&sa;=N&tab;=wi&ei;=RScHUuzuBOSb2QWW9oDQAw&biw;=1366&bih;=572&sei;=SycHUq7cNLH62AXTooAI#facrc=_&imgdii;=_&imgrc;=doxiR_iDWaW07M%3A%3BsudncrW7al8LcM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fecx.images-amazon.com%252Fimages%252FI%252F51lFhEBwv6L.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.amazon.com%252FMonoprice-108320-Enhanced-Isolating-Earphones%252Fdp%252FB007VEQ2UU%3B500%3B322Once you put them on correctly, you'll realize what it seems 1,000s of others have..these are the best 10$ headphones you will ever find. I listened to Modest Mouse "Good News for People Who Love Bad News" hundred of times before now, on dozens of different headphones. Hearing them through these revealed details and changes to the balancing of the songs I had never picked up before. The bass is pronounced but not overwhelming (common problem at this price point) and the mids are very warm. Surprisingly good build quality as well (at least for the all black version.. the silver version looks like it might be made of cheaper, less robust plastic). Generally I have a hard time thinking what other thing one can buy for 10 bucks that performs so well. From my experience they can hang with most headphones in the 40-60 dollar range for sound quality and probably quite a few around 100$.

$review_text.: I hate to say, I did not like this cover... For one, it was shipped VERY LATE and I only knew of the shipping status AFTER emailing the seller.  I'm a pretty understanding person, as stuff happens, but the lack of communication with a delay (and it was delayed beyond their second estimated delivery) cost a star.Outside of that, not a fan of the design.  The little tabs that hold the iPad into place didn't feel secure.  The material is very stiff to fold back and use the handle, so it felt like my thumb was fighting to keep it from flipping over.  I ended up putting it away and reordering my previous iPad Mini's cover.

$review_text.: The glasses work great.I watched Tangled 3D at night, so I cannot say about ambient light influencing the frame detection, but the glasses did not lose the link with the TV so 3D was on all the time no matter what.Color/brightness: no problems there. TV is Samsung HLT5687S, and watching Tangled 3D the colors... everything was great. I suspect that once in 3D mode the TV does boost the colors, brightness... to adjust to 3D glasses being used. That's on an un-calibrated HDMI input (HDMI3, the one for 3D). I calibrated the other input and devices, so I have a pretty good comparison point :-). And a calibrated TV image is not super bright super saturated colors as folks see in stores.For children, the glasses are really big and tend to fall on the nose. For adults, they are the right size to wear prescription glasses under it - both my wife and I do wear glasses.I will buy a 3rd pair, either identical or kid size if the same store/brand has that for children.I watch most 3D movies in theaters, and tried all 3D glasses (Active and passive) in TV stores to compare, but these are the first I used at home. Compared to the stores: they seem to be the same quality.But I cannot really compare these glasses to other brands or models like Xpand as I have not spent enough time with other brands. Hence your mileage may vary.

 Love the touch screen and options (borders - writing on photos)


 I have yet to get a good macro photo - they usually come out blurry - in all fairness I will watch the CD that came with the camera regarding macros and see it there is anything I am doing wrong here
The landscape shots are nice but definitely lose focus in the distance and are a bit noisy
If you have a program to refocus and reduce noise you can still produce a nice landscape
 Great for candid photos of people

 Battery seems to last longer then I expected

 For the price this is an acceptable camera.

$REVIEW.: I am very happy with this purchase. I have tried the antenna in two different places:First I tried outside about 7 ft high mounted on my garage roof. Then I tried in my attic by using the optional J mount. We live in a 2 story Home and I believe the added height was offsetting the fact that the antenna is indoors. The result was a little better in the attic and I don't have to worry about cable routing or weathering.We receive about 30 channels, many of them in crystal clear 1080P HD signal with good reception. Some channels come in weaker and while my TV says the reception is poor I can still see a great picture.We have cancelled cable TV and now use the HD antenna in combination with online TV such as Netflix and Amazon prime via a Roku. The Antenna and the Roku are paid for within 2 month of not having cable. This is a no brainer, go get the antenna and cancel cable. I never understood why I would pay for cable TV and still have to watch commercials all the time. I still have to see commercial now but at least the programming comes in for free.The only downside is that you have less channels to choose from and no TV guide. But we pretty much only watch the same 5 network channels anyways.I should add that the Antenna signal is split to feed into 2 Tv's.

Image quality is fine -- this isn't going to completely replace my M4/3 gear, and I'm not expecting it to. But I've no complaints about the pictures I get with it.The 2.8 lens is quite good, especially combined with the image stabilizer.There are a few things I'd love to see changed (Hey, Panasonic, do enhancing firmware updates like Fuji does!)1. Auto ISO needs more range.2. I'd love to have a simple one-button digital teleconverter like the Canons have. Too cumbersome to go through the menu to activate digital zoom, and frankly, most of the upper digital zoom range is garbage.3. About $100 too expensive. I had some eBay bucks that I used to bring the cost down when I bought it there.

$review_text.: I'm a novice with projectors and wasn't sure what to expect but I'm pretty impressed with this one.  To begin at the beginning, setting it up, which I thought might be intimidating, was actually quite easy.  The Quick Setup booklet guides you through the process, allowing you to choose your preferred connection.  It also has advice on adjusting the position of the projector and sharpening the image if necessary.  There are also troubleshooting and help sections if you need them.Once set up, the first thing you'll notice (or at least I did) is the dazzling color.  The EX5230 features 3500 white lumens and 3500 color lumens, a measure of color brightness.  So even if the room is not completely dark, the picture will still appear bright, crisp and luminous, not washed-out or faded.The internal speakers, while not outstanding, are pretty decent for built-ins and should serve for most presentations.  In any event, they could easily be overridden if you find the sound quality to be  inadequate.This small projector was built for portability.  Its compact size and fairly light weight (about 5 lbs, 6 oz) make it a natural to take to meetings or on vacation with the family.  The included nylon messenger bag is the perfect size to hold it and comes equipped with a shoulder strap for convenience.

In my situation, I simply put my keyboard on top of the base and all is well.If your considering a 3x stand, don't hesitate, very well worth it.

So I got almost five years from the original batteries which isn't terrible I guess.When these batteries arrived I hooked them up into the into plastic wiring frame from the disassembled original battery pack, wrapped a strip of duct tape around them to hold it all together as one unit as before, popped the battery pack into the unit, plugged it up, and you're good to go.UPDATE 11/13/2013... Has been almost exactly one year since I installed these batteries. I've had zero issues with them to date.***Be sure to disassemble your original battery pack before disposing of the old batteries! I was about to dispose of the entire battery pack without realizing that I needed to disassemble it and keep the plastic wiring frame. Fortunately I had read a couple of reviews that clued me in on this BEFORE I disposed of the battery pack. Whew! That would have been an expensive mistake had I gone through with it.

The inline wire headphone adaptors break too easy. These are rugged, easy to use and do not diminish the quality or volume of music from the shuffles, ( I have multiple Ipod shuffles). Worth the price of admission.
$SUMMARY.: Awesome

$review_text.: I have this same style of case on my Kindle Fire and it looks great. The outside leather is extremely soft and supple and its two tone colors makes it look great. The football concept is a nice touch and it makes is a great conversation piece. The inside is coated with a very soft fiber that will protect your screen and the back of your device. The outside leather will just look better and better as the leather ages and begins to pick up a patina from the oil in your hands.The case has a snap cover for added security and it is a nice touch. Built into the cover is a magnet to allow your iPad Mini to automatically turn off and on with the close of the lid.The case allows you to set up your device in a tilt mode to watch videos and read and the viewing angle is adjustable to suit your comfort. The case is professionally stitched and assembled and the leather is first class quality.  The back cover of the case has a hole in it for the rear facing camera.This is a very nice case, it is well made, it looks good and it features good craftsmanship. I recommend it to you and I gave it 5 stars.Please note that I received a sample of the product for evaluation and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.
$review_summary.: Nice craftsmanship and attractive case for your iPad Mini!

$REVIEW.: I connected the Input to the back of my PC, 1 Output to my PC Monitor, and the other Output to my TV. When I Powered it on the TV one was good, but the PC one was a Pixelated Rainbow. I bought New HDMI Cables so thinking it might be just a bad Cable, I connected the old one I had, and the picture was still the same. I then unplugged the TV HDMI, and the PC cleared up. So to use my TV as my PC Monitor I have to unplug my PC Monitor HDMI then plug in my TV HDMI. Was excited to get it, disappointed when it didn't work.

$review_text.: I was looking for a smaller inexpensive LCD and this turned out nicely. It was at a great price, qualified as a free shipping eligible item and it was back-lit. Once I got it in my hands it was really well packaged and I was happy to find the accessories included as a bonus. It came with a male/male header strip for soldering so it can slip into a solderless breadboard, as well as a male to female header if you'd rather plug in pins as well as a diode and a 10k potentiometer for the contrast adjustment. It also happened to come with a nice business card type card that was double sided with pin breakout identification and a wiring diagram on the other side. A nice touch no question about it. I also liked how the pins were all labeled on the PCB as well as a number notation for the 1st and 16th pins.I swapped this into my project that was utilizing a 4 line LCD. These both use the LCD hitatchi driver so swapping it in was nice and easy to do. Do remember to change your code (in my case I was working with the Arduino) to match the LCD setup. For example I changed "lcd.begin(16, 4);" to "lcd.begin(16, 2);" otherwise the text was overlapping on each other. Also had to adjust the lines where the text was being printed. So if you had it on line 4 you'll have to relocate it. I will be adding some photos so you can see it in action and the items in the kit. Definitely would buy again!

$REVIEW.: I bought this a couple of days and at first I was wary until I finally installed the wireless on the machine.Before then, i had bought a 2gb sd card and put some pdfs on there. I was disappointed when the machine wouldn't read them initially and soon became a little frustrated.After the wireless update to whatever the lookbook is supposed to be from, the lookbook had a new kind of shelving system for the book. (sort of like goodreads version) and it had a doc tab which i found out that 's where it puts all the pdfs of your books.i haven't seen if it'll do the epub file yet, but reading the books seem rather easy to put on and to bring up once the book updated.It took about twenty minutes for the lookbook to update, but afterwards it was pretty cool. I want to figure out how to get rid of some of the books on there (it came with 25 old books), but other than that, i do like the way it feels and reads.I had to turn a couple of pdfs sideways to get a good screen but most times it's pretty darn good.The only thing i wish is that it had an audio function, but it's color and that's awesome in itself.Now i did read some of the reviews and the buttons could be just a tad bigger, but other wise once you get used to the side buttons, it's really okay to deal with for the price i paid. the battery life is only four hours but i'm cool about that. (I ride to chicago and back and that's all i really need.)the really great thing about this is that i picked this bad boy up for $40 at CVS! (yes, with my extrabucks card).

$review_text.: Small and compact dashcam that disappears completely behind my rearview mirror. It records to MicroSD media and is currently the top value as recommended by Dashcamtalk forum. The power adapter cord was adequate for me to hide along the headliner down the door seal and into the cigarette lighther socket. It comes on automatically when the car comes on and makes a sound when doing so, this is helpful because since I can't see the unit it's good to know it turned on. A previous dashcam I had would not power on reliably so this gives me the peace of mind that my drive is being recorded as intended. This camera features a true 120 degree field of view, in layman's terms that means it sees just about a wide view as your eyes do. In practical terms, in the unfortunate event another car cuts you off and causes you to hit them from behind, chances are the wide field of view will help your cause tremendously in proving your case. I hope I'll never have to test that theory, but the case stands that you want true 120 degree visibility in a dashcam. I've set it up to cycle record in 10 min blocks so the memory card will just fill itself up and delete the oldest file. With a 16gb card in there I should be able to retrieve any footage I need before it's overwritten. The unit is light and so far it has stuck onto the windshield for at least 3 weeks with no issues. 1080p video quality means that under optimal daytime conditions you can actually read license plates from the footage but because of the wide angle of view you would have to be pretty close to the car in front of you. It's too bad Amazon doesn't carry this camera directly since the overseas shipping took quite some time to get here
$SUMMARY.: Best value dashcam with 1080p

The keyboard is a little awkward, small keys, and the case doesn't look/feel like leather (more like vinyl or synthetic material) but it does the job well for the price. The magnetic case enclosure works fine, though I wonder if it will hold up over a couple years. Time will tell. Amazing customer service.

Beware, the power lines (in my house at least) have a decent amount of feedback and/or interference. It's kind of annoying to hear the humming noise while trying to have a conversation. Fax quality is undisturbed however. This isn't a limitation of this product, however, it's just a byproduct of data transmission over power lines.

$REVIEW.: I've been a home theater geek ever since home theater was invented. Over the years, I've used many different brands of HDMI cables. Some were exorbitantly expensive, others were only a few dollars in price. I could never see or hear any differences in signal quality among the cables. I don't have any professional equipment that measures differences among cables, I'm just going by personal experience.I recently purchased a nifty new 65&#34; Sony TV, which necessitated the rearrangement of my AV equipment. The HDMI cables that I had been using were fat and rather inflexible, making them difficult to snake around the shelving and equipment. Their size also made them less than perfect to plug in to the crowded HDMI inputs of my new TV. I looked on Amazon for a solution and came across these slender, flexible PNY cables. I orderd several of them and have been completely satisfied. Their slender build makes them really easy to install and easier to hide out of sight. And they work perfectly. My high definition sources look as good as they always have. They transmit Dolby Digital and DTS signals perfectly.My days of buying expensive, bulky cables are over. I'll be purchasing some more of these for our bedroom theater system soon.

$REVIEW.: We used to be a Windows family.  All through high school and college I had PCs - and so did my wife's family - they called them "IBM's" when I got my first one, even though it wasn't made by IBM.  We'd been convinced that while Mac's were more attractive, window's-based PCs were more practical.Not anymore.  When I had the option at work to get a new machine, I decided to take a chance on an iMac - and loved it.  Still, when my wife needed a laptop for home use, she went with the Sony Vaio.  It seemed like the perfect machine, it was top-of-the-line, the very best Vaio available at the time.  Yet she had endless problems with it - the power cord burned out while under warranty and we had to ship it to get fixed, then another one burned out right after the warranty was up.  The dvd drive stopped working.  We were plagued by viruses and spybots, and had to buy a subscription to a virus protection program, which worked but seemed to slow things down.  The machine overheated regularly -- even late at night with no one using it, we'd hear the fan blowing at top speed unless we shut it off.  After three years, the machine up and died.So she went with this Mac, and after 9 months her honeymoon's not over.  She loves it.  Once you get used to the differences, Mac OS X is intuitive and flexible.  It's hard to explain to someone who hasn't tried, but working with OS X is not only intuitive and easy, it's aesthetically satisfying.  It's simple and elegant.  We love the software that comes with it.  My kids useiLife '09all the time - especially iMovie and iPhoto.  I use it for editing video and love the flexibility of Apple'sFinal Cut Express 4.Sure, they just came out with a newer model that's even fancier and slightly faster and less expensive than what we paid -- but that's to be expected in the technology game.  One note: I have the aluminum shelled Mac Book Pro and I think I prefer her white case to mine.  When I upgrade in a few years I'll go with the white.  The aluminum does warp slightly after a period of use, but the white shell appears to be exactly the same 9 moths later as it was when we picked it up. We're very happy we went with a Mac.

One day, I went to put in a DVD and it made a horribled noise and refused to play a single DVD.This is actually the second Sony DVD player I have owned, and the other one met the same fate. I am not sure if it is just a bum player in a large lot of exceptional ones, or Sony does not make as good products anymore. This Player worked really good when it worked. It gave no warning, just crapped out. I also own a Panasonic DVD player that has outlasted both Sony's, so I dont know that I would buy another Sony. Just be careful and make sure you have a warranty when you purchase one and Good Luck!

$review_text.: This SSD lives up to its tested reputation for speed and responsiveness. The "lifetime of the device issue" can only really be annswered after much use and months/years of read writes and Trim. Its good to see another chipset manufacturer get into making SSD chipsets as this always stimulates the market toward innovation. When I say this is a snappy feeling SSD I come from a main computer that uses a PCIe based SSD with specs that are twice as fast as these and feel that is very snappy and all of this is in a desktop workstation. This SSD was used on a new install with Windows 8 and a 24" touchscreen. Its very fast in this environment and did a good job of outperforming a VelociRaptor and accepting the image made from that drive. It also excells at large file(300gb)reads and writes.

The connectors appeared to be manufactured well and had a good strain relief built-in to the cloth cable jacket on both ends.  This worried me a bit because the strain relief should really be more applicable to the actual cable jacket and not the cloth outer layer, but it seems to be holding up just fine.  The ferrite magnets on both ends did their job to reject electrical noise.I would definitely recommend this cable for simple 1:1 hookups up to a 100' distance.

This thing has paid for itself in less than one month.  The sound quality is excellent and the battery life is fantastic.

$review_text.: [Note: These are identical with the Belkin "Vector" cases except for the stripes. So they cost 1/3 as much per sleeve. (Last Sept. it was over 1/4 as much.)]What's the catch?  2 sleeve cases at half the going price of many single cases?  No deception whatsoever.  It's merely an ingeniously simple, quick, and effective way to assure that the silvery backside of your iPod remains untarnished and that if the precious device is, heaven forbid, dropped, some of the shock of the fall will be absorbed by the cover.  The rubbery material is just thick enough to serve as a reasonably resilient and potentially protective bumper while remaining thin enough to permit operation of the iPod in virtually any speaker-dock without removal of the sleeve.Of course, you'll need to spring for a portfolio-style case if you wish to protect the glass screen. (Or, if you're merely wary of scratches, you could cover it with one of those clinging, transparent sheets.)  But face it.  How often have you found such elaborate cases too cumbersome to be worth the bother?  You're not protecting an expensive, appreciating asset, and like it's very name suggests, the Touch is built for communicating with other users and surfers.  Why get all fussed up about insulating it?The Belkin Sleeve slips on the iPod in a microsecond and with a gesture that's totally intuitive.  So if like me your pajamas are blue and your street wear black, living couldn't get much easier.  (Hint: Although I'm currently seeing the package offered by an Amazon sub-vendor at a lower rate, you may wish to order the item directly from Amazon if you have Prime.)

Funny part is I have been in these addresses and they are good 5 , 10 years old addresses. Cannot be an issue with outdated maps.For couple of places it gave me wrong direction , it guided me near to the place but no road after that. I wish I was a pilot flying a Cessna 152 ( Yes I was ) then this is the perfect GPS , coze there is no roads in the sky.

The systems don't seem to overheat, and with a connection to the internet, they can play Netflix and other media content very well. Unfortunately, local media playback is not included as a feature yet. I have almost all of the launch titles, and the only one I've had any issues with is Battlefield 4. Overall I am very impressed with the system and can't wait to play online with friends and family.

$review_text.: The Magellan 1440 is a 4.3 inch GPS unit equipped with maps of North America.  I have a previous Magellan GPS unit and found this to be an improvement in several key ways as detailed below:Pros:1.  The 4.3 inch screen does not sound like a significant upgrade  from a 3.5 inch, but it is like going from a standard definition TV to a HD television system.  It is a noticeable difference.  Graphics are nice, and you get pop-ups showing the correct freeway ramps to take, plus the unit zooms in on tricky freeway intersections and the like. Nice feature.2. Set-up:  I found this to be quite easy and straightforward.  In fact, all I did was power up the unit and let it find a satellite location.  This does take a few minutes, so don't expect directions in moments.  However, after the first satellite location, it only takes mere seconds for subsequent location finding.  Power is scant, so you will need to power up the unit with either the included power cord for the car, or the USB cord.3. The unit itself is about the width of your thumbnail, which is pretty small.  A speaker is located in the back, with the USB cord on the bottom.4. The holder which is included is far better constructed than my previous model.  It feels more secure and stable, and the hook-up to the unit is a slide-in slot on the back rather than the previous holder which was like hands.  (let me note I didn't have problems with that holder, but this feels more secure).5.  One touch is a feature that takes you to the things you would probably want beyond directions such as your route home, points of interest, gas and battery power and satellite strength.  It is very easy to locate and works well when driving.6. Points of interest include AAA listings and are fairly good.  Some locations will be out of date, but overall you can find the things you need most.  It has helped me locate things like a gas station when low on gas!7. Ease of use:  it is straightforward and easy to use.  Easy to punch in a location and have the GPS locate you a route.8. Brightness seems fine in broad daylight.  A driver may want to go to system features and turn off the battery saving feature which seems to make things dimmer at all times.9. Traffic feature:  for a pretty low price, you can buy a power adapter which allows you to receive traffic updates for your unit.  This is (considering the price) a great feature.Neutral:1.  Location of USB port:  my previous model had the USB port located on the left side which was terrible because I then a cord running invariably underneath and behind the unit to the power plug.  This model makes an improvement by locating the port underneath.  I do wish the unit had been oriented other way so that you don't have to scrunch the cord to run it the other direction (is this for a British car because no American model has power located on the left side of the driver, and most drivers will place the item near the center.2. Spoken languages:  Not much choice here, just English, French and Spanish.3. No capacity I am aware of to add voices or sounds off the internet.4. There is a micro-SD slot, I have no idea what to use it for since it is not explained anywhere. Map updates of some sort?  Nothing is noted anywhere that would tell the user what the purpose of having this is.Cons:1. Quite honestly, I have not encountered any real problems or issues.2. If you must have features such as Bluetooth, or voice dialing, this does not have those features.3. On/Off button:  My previous unit had a button you had to press and hold down for a few moments before start-up.  This unit has a sliding on/off button.  Frankly, after some use, the button is an annoyance.  Not a major issue, but I don't like this button!4. Can't tell my location:  actually no, that isn't true! - I can tell my present location, but compared to my previous Magellan here is the difference - I had a digital compass with an altimeter.  Neat stuff when driving across the Mojave desert or Imperial Valley below sea level.  I can't find this feature anymore on this unit and greatly wish it was there because it was cool.  Definitely not pleased with this. Knowing your position relative to a compass was a nice feature.  Knowing your altitude was a bonus.  Why was this taken out?Overall, I find this unit to be a simple and reliable source of driving information.  It has many features relative to the price.  It is easy to use, and uncomplicated.  Having only used Magellan GPS units, I cannot comment on other models such as Tom-Tom or Garmin (they have some cool commercials though), but I believe a buyer cannot go wrong with this unit if you're looking for an easy and basic GPS unit.  Overall, I am quite pleased.  I do not believe a user will be disappointed in the slightest with this unit.May I also recommend this friction mount:HDFMB-2: i.Trek V2 Open Front Heavy Duty Friction Mount Base for Garmin, TomTom, Magellan GPS Devices
$SUMMARY.: Very good basic GPS unit.  Not fancy, but gets the job done with ease.

$REVIEW.: the first landscape I shot with my new lens made it to Explore on Flickr and got over 10,000 hits in a few days.  I'm sold.  As a landscape photographer this little lens gives me twice the ability to frame great shots.  I was nervous at first with it.  It slips onto the corner over the lens but doesn't screw on or have a way to attech it securely.  After I got used to the idea it was safe and realized I wasn't going to lose it easily I became more comfortable.  It won't fall off as I had feared.  It comes with a nice little lens bag which doubles as a lens cloth.  I made a pouch to keep the pouches in and felt secure while out shooting.  I tried th polarizer over the telephoto and by itself.  Loved it's effects both ways.  I'm just beginning with it but know it's well worth the price tag.  Now I'm dying to get the 4 in one too.

$REVIEW.: I wish I had the Garmin Forerunner 305 five years ago when I started running.  It's easy to set up, the menus are clear, and the features are useful.  It would be perfect if the heartrate display was 2 to 3 times larger for quick glances and the side buttons were easier to press.  The pace reading doesn't update as quickly as my cell phone's SportsTracker app does but it is possible that I simply haven't figured out which settings to change for that yet.  You can set it to beep at predefined distances, speed ranges, or heartrate ranges.  You might not be able to hear the beeps if you're listening to music while running (but there may be a volume setting that I haven't found yet).

$review_text.: This case does the job but adds more bulk to the already bulky Aura HD. The bottom line is that it protects the reader when it's in my bag effectively.It falls short when compared to similar cases I have used in the past for other devices. In particular, the Speck Products FitFolio line for Nook and the Omoton Kindle cases are superior both in their feel - they provide more grip and don't feel as bulky - and in the mechanism used to keep them closed.Compared to those cases, this one doesn't feel quite as good when you hold it and the cover tends to slide around when closed (there is no clasp and the spine is not rigid enough to hold it in place). On the whole, though, this case works well.

$REVIEW.: After reading other reviews, I knew I would either love this product or hate it - there doesn't appear to be a middle ground.  I followed other advice and watched the official Speck YouTube video twice before trying it myself.  While my experience was not quite as smooth as on the video, it was close enough.  I had a lot more bubbles, but I was able to push all of them out with a credit card with one exception where a speck got caught underneath near one corner.  I wasn't able to get it out as I had already completed all the application and taken off both sides of protective wrapping, but I decided that even with my slight OCD tendencies it didn't bother me enough to do anything further.  The screen definitely is easier to see when in bright lights, and like all other anti-glare protectors, it also tends to take of a slight amount of the brightness - that's the tradeoff with these protectors.All in all, good product at a good price!

$REVIEW.: The DNS321 works excellent.  Very easy to install drives, easy to set-up, and connected immediately.  I wish the mapping tool was installed.  I just moved it over from the CD to my local drive.  I installed 2 Seagate ES2 500GB and am running RAID1 (mirrored).  I used a laptop, and remapped all of 'My Documents' to the network drive.  My only complaint is not about the product itself...it's about the speed via wireless.  Lack of network performance is not very noticeable when only using the internet, butt when you're transferring large amounts of data, it's much more apparent.  I have a DLink N router, and just bought a DLink N card.  With the G card I was getting about 1.2 MB/sec, and with the N card I'm getting almost double.  It's still slow compared to the wire, which was about 14 MB/sec (still not great).  The performance was more of an issue when I was doing the initial transfer of all my files.  Now it isn't really a big deal.  If I need to transfer a lot of data, I just plug in.I researched a lot of NAS units, and I deceided that I wanted to select my own hard drives.  Most of the units which come with drives, come with cheaper drives.  I went with 'commercial' drives which are built to be spinning 24/7.  There is, however, a setting in the config firmware site where you can turn off the drives after a certain period of time...similar to your computer.  Also, you can set it up to email you when a drive fails.  I hope I never receive that email, but it's nice to know that you will be notified immediately.  Haven't set up the FTP yet.  It did pick up the NAS in iTunes, although I haven't played with it yet.Anyway, so far, so good.  Oh, and be sure you get SATA drives with the newest power connector.

$REVIEW.: Firstly, having a cover with a magnetic on switch is totally worth it for these tablets.  I fully recommend getting some cover with this feature.I bought this one after buying this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008I0E712/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00, which I *loved* apart from the fact that it had leather around the screen, really impeding those Android swipe motions, particularly from the top status bar.Therefore I bought this, also hoping for something slimmer and lighter.  Unfortunately it's nowhere near as slim as it could be, adding quite a bit of thickness without any particular benefit.My main gripe though is that it feels plasticy and cheap, and I could never love it - it's obviously some sticky vinyl faux leather just stuck on some plastic - it looks cheap and feels cheap in the hand, with coarse metal/plastic areas on the right where your fingers fall.The 'stand' feature is just about adequate (actually better than that other one), but even given this and the swiping problems, I'm going back to the other.  The comfortable  feel of the leather in the hands is totally worth its deficiencies compared to this one.

$REVIEW.: I paid $ 8.00 for this and it works, works well
I connected both 3.5" SATA and IDE hard drives to this adapter and I got an average of 35 mb/sec read and 30 mb/sec write performance

The drives were recognized easily on a Windows 7 64-bit machine...no need to install third party drivers or anything like that.However it is cheaply made:* The Power and USB cords are too short...no longer than 2.5 feet each very inconvenient depending on the distance of your AC outlet.* The unit that plugs into the drives does not have an activity light.* It's made out of a cheap flimsy plastic.* The rubber boot that encloses the USB cord to protect it from breaking is very slack, almost useless IMO.* The power adapter (Model# HYJK-3018) that came with the kit gets uncomfortably hot really fast


I modified it by replacing the stock heat-sink on the power transistor (a thin 1 1/2" x .75" piece of sheet aluminum) with a beefier one and drilled some holes in the case to improve the ventilation

Hopefully that should extend the life of the unit somewhat.You have to treat it with care, that's for sure
But for the price it's still a relatively good value.

This protector covers the ENTIRE FACE of the vita and is just as clear as the Sony one


On top of that, it comes with SIX face covers
3 for the front, 3 for the back (opposed to Sony's which only comes with 2 for the front)
I purchased this mainly for the protection of the rear touchscreen but I may just remove my Sony protector and replace it with the front screen protector from this package

Just make sure you install it correctly.

It's just as good as the "GE Super-Radio". I'm in the NY area, and can pick up AM stations all over the US and Canada. #2, the audio quality is excellent. Battery life is also excellent. As shortwave radio, it has its shortcomings. By design, the radio has an analog tuner with a digital display. This causes the radio to drift, as most analog radios do. Many people think because it has a digital frequency display, that it's a digital tuner. Not so. If drift is going to annoy you, then look elsewhere.

$review_text.: I have been using this mouse for almost a month now and I am very satisfied with it. It is smaller than most mice, but fits snuggly in my hand, considering that I have big hands. It is very responsive (sometimes too responsive) and the back button and mouse wheel complement its functionality. The battery indicator is another great plus, cause at least you can get a warning when you are running low; although it is very energy-efficient, I'm still using the packed standard AAA batteries with an average of 6-7 hours of daily use. And the power switch is also great for saving energy.To sum up, Pros:- Excellent Microsoft design (esthetical, ergonomical)- Great price- Very responsive (it's laser, not optical)- Great battery life (I'll let you know on the comments when the first pair of batteries run out. I already have a rechargeable pair on stand-by).- Instant pairing with bluetooth enabled PC's (I did not try it on a Mac)- Back button functionality- Power switch lets you turn it off when not in use to save battery, and you just turn it on and in a couple of seconds it reconnects (this has been a life-saver since I walk away from my desk very often, and I would not like that some envious co-worker "borrowed" it for his home, and it fits quite nicely on my shirt or pants pocket)- It glides very smoothly on almost any surface (even on my bed sheets)- It comes with a nice carry-bag.Cons:- It has dropped the connection about 5 or 6 times during the time I have been using it, but it reconnects after turning on and off again. Kind of annoying.- I wish it had a forward buttong as well.- It is somethimes too responsive, depending on the surface you wear it on. I fixed this by tweaking the mouse sensitivity on the Windows mouse settings.I recommend this bluetooth mouse.UPDATE (2/23/08): Well, the battery indicator is going red now (3 months after I started using it), but, if I could, I would downgrade my rating to 3 stars because of the following: The power switch broke like a week ago (the damn thing kinda got loose of it's place and still moves, but it doesn't change the power state). I tried going DIY and tried fixing it myself, but ended up getting it worse, although I managed the leave the power on. This means poor craftsmanship from Microsoft, because I consider I did not misused the mouse. I now can't turn the mouse off, so I have to remove the batteries every time I don't use it. This resulted on casting the mouse aside and leaving it just for special occasions (long meetings or surfing @ home).I still consider the mouse is good, but this has negatively changed my opinion on Microsoft hardware (don't even get me started on their SW).
$review_summary.: Very good bluetooth mouse

$REVIEW.: I saw this bag in a smaller size at one of the national office supply stores, and I loved it. I resisted buying because bigger would have been better and the price was high.Came home and checked out Amazon--and of course, found what I thought was the same bag (it was the same brand) in a bigger size for less money.I love the soft leather and dark brown color. I love the vertical design. I love the size--as a teacher, its perfect for toting home folders full of student's papers to grade and still have room for my wallet and what-nots, so I only have to carry one bag. The straps are the perfect length to carry the bag on my shoulder.However, I was very disappointed that the "back-side" of the bag is nylon--the side shown in the picture that fits over the handle of a suitcase. Makes sense for a frequent traveler to have the durability of nylon, but I purchased it to use primarily as an oversized purse/tote bag, I was expecting and would have preferred all leather.So buyer beware--I don't see anywhere in the product description that one side is nylon. The bag I saw at the national office supply store was all leather. :(
$SUMMARY.: Love the bag...but not the nylon "back-side"

The detachable pages are nice, but small nuisance is having to take them all out in order to re-arrange them.  The fold-flat handle is nice, too.  One other model has the handle that is permanently "bulged out."

$REVIEW.: I use this to get wireless connectivity on my Linux box.  The wifi adapter I had didn't work with my Linux version, so I got this.  It works well.  No drivers needed.  I do have to reset the connection once in a while, but I can't say for sure if it's my computer or the device.  I unplug it, replug it, switch to static IP, use the admin web interface to reconnect, then put it back to DHCP.  Everything is already pre-saved and I have a shortcut to the web interface, so it's a pretty quick thing to do.  When I get a CAT5 drop in here I'm going to use this for my printer.

$review_text.: So far, so good.  This device works much better than the old Tom Tom.  As others have stated, loading the maps is definitely time consuming, don't start it unless you have plenty of time.  When the computer says 2 hours load time, it was two hours, and I have an up to date fast computer.  Immediately after that, there was another hour to load the map update, for a total of three hours map loading time.  The first time you turn it on, it takes a few minutes for the device to locate satellites, it thought it was still in Michigan or somewhere and looked there first.  After that, no problem locating satellites.  I found one inaccuracy in the map, it tries to send me through a road near my home, and that road is a dead end, it is farmland and was closed 50 years ago.  As you all probably know, when you know where you are going and know the best route, there is no way to get the device to follow that route, it computes either the shortest route or the fastest route (not always right), nothing in between.  Other than that, the Nuvi 1450 is a pleasure to use.

$review_text.: Like so many other people here, my unit arrived with nothing working except the blue light that projected a motionless wave pattern on the ceiling
 I needed it for a child's gift exchange party in 2 days

 I just knew this would be a hit if it worked, so I decided to put on my rocket scientist hat and try fixing it myself
I'm a single mom with ZERO mechanical abilities, and I managed to fix this very quickly


It took me longer to figure out the problems and materials needed than the act of actually fixing it
You'll have to be a LITTLE resourceful and VERY gentle, depending on the problem

Wiring problems require a soldering iron


Here is what to do:1

 Put in 4 AA batteries (or use the included USB with appropriate adapter to plug it in)

I used batteries to make it easier to move around
Press the middle power button and put the unit close to your ear
If you can hear a slight whirring noise, the motor is working, and the problem is a rubber band


 If you can't hear a whirring noise, then it's a wiring connection


In my case, my unit had 3 bad connections AND a broken rubber band! They appeared to have happened during normal shipping movement
Wiring connections were VERY VERY flimsy.2
 Gently remove the blue plastic lens - it just pulls off, no screws or anything.3

 Take a tiny screwdriver and unscrew the 3 screws holding the wave mechanism to the base


 DO NOT PULL THIS OFF QUICKLY - there are very fine wires attaching it to the base, and yanking it will break any connections that are good!4


 Check speaker wires
 There should be 2 wires connected to the speaker unit

 In my case, only one was connected, the other was hanging loose


I stripped some of the vinyl coating from the wire by pinching with my fingernails - a wire stripper would have cut the hair-thin wires
Soldering the wire to the connection with a soldering iron did the trick

This will fix your speaker problems.5
 Check wave-motion-motor wires

 There should be 2 wires (red and yellow) attached to the wave mechanism 

In my case, both were disconnected


Again, I stripped some of the vinyl coating from the wires and used a soldering iron to reattach the wires to the unit


(connection for red wire has a red dot, so no guessing)6


 At this point, my wave-motor worked, but the waves were still not moving
There is a small metal pin that is turned by the motor


 A rubber band goes from that pin and around a large gear - this causes the large gear to turn


 There is a smaller rubber band that goes from the big gear to a smaller gear, and THAT connects to a lever that rocks the wave mechanism
Sounds very confusing, but if you look at it, it makes perfect sense and you can see exactly how it works and the grooves where the rubber bands go


On my unit, the large rubber band was fine - but it had slipped off the gear - so I used a crochet hook to snare it and get it back in the groove on the big gear and around the metal pin

 The small rubber band was broken, so I used a little girl's rubber hair-band (NOT elastic - it has to be bare rubber to grip the gear) and slipped it over the smaller gear


 SUCCESS!!To use the MP3 speakers, you must have the volume on your Ipod (or Kindle or whatever) turned up 100%, and then use the 2 blue buttons on the wave unit to adjust the volume


I'm no music afficionado, but the speakers sounded pretty good to me - certainly good enough for the kids that are going to be fighting over this
 I've used the machine periodically all day with my Kindle Fire connected to it - with no problems

With freshly-soldered connections and a new (stronger) rubber-band, this thing probably works better now than it did when it came off the assembly line.Would have been nice to receive a working piece of equipment, but I'm very happy with how it turned out! I don't want to give it away!

$SUMMARY.: It can be fixed - and then it's awesome!

$review_text.: I am a wedding photographer and so the main purpose for this setup was/is intended to allow my assistants and I to easily and efficiently communicate on the wedding day.  The headsets that came with the 2-way radios were not very good quality, but I had prepared for that by reading past consumer reviews and I purchased these 2-way radios in combination with the Midland AVPH3 Transparent Security Headsets (which had a better rating).Pros:  The radios work and the headpieces (purchased separately) are comfortable.  Great battery life.  Photographed a 15hr wedding and although we didn't use the radios that whole time, I was still surprised that they lasted the day with what we did use of them.Cons:  BIGGEST CON...it's extremely hard to hear on the headset.  With the volume all the way up, we couldn't make out words when using the included headsets....and can only barely hear each other on the AVPH3 headsets.  We tried different channels and checked all the settings...could never get more than a whisper of voice volume...but at least I had the ability to "beep" my assistant and they could know I was trying to communicate something to them.  Also, I failed to switch one of the radio's power-saving-mode off...and so a couple times that day, I wasn't able to reach my assistant on the radio.  I didn't realized the problem until after the wedding.  I'm pretty sure that was the problem, so I'm hoping to not have those same problems at my next wedding job.  One more con, when my assistants and I split up (one went with Groom to church, one with the Bride)...I was only in the car a few minutes (no more than 1-2 miles) and we lost communication.  I know this radio set says up to 36 miles...but I found that I needed to be in the same building for them to work.  Not a huge problem since we also have wonderful devices such as cell phones...but with our job, we have to keep our phones on vibrate and can something not feel it going off when we are actively shooting.Conclusion:  For the price, it does most of what I need it to do for my particular need...so I am satisfied.

$review_text.: I just purchased this ball head from my local camera store after doing a hands on assessment and I could not be happier with my purchase unless they started giving them away.This mount is solid and when the locks are in place your camera is not going to move but can easily be removed when you decide your done taking photos.I have a couple of Manfrotto heads I have been very happy with prior to this purchase and the quality of the 498RC2 it no different


 This ball head is everything I expected.The ball head is solid, smooth and very well machined

 My one slight gripe is NO BUBBLE LEVEL....My camera body now has an artificial horizon so not such a big detractor but for 130+ dollars out the door or shipped it should have one just the same whether you would need it or not....Also, while in the store prior to my purchase of the 498RC2 I looked at other 350 dollar ball heads, some with bubble levels..

:-( and I could not see them being better or worth the extra coin


 If you have used Manfrotto in the past or have experience with the RC2 system you know the quality you get on a budget


 Save your money, buy this ball head and use the money saved toward a better tripod, glass or body.

The unit was on charge for 24 hours but would not take a charge
It ran when it was plugged into a USB connection but would not run otherwise


While plugged in it performed well with my iPod through the LOA I purchased


It didn't do a lot for my EnV Touch or a laptop headphone jack except add a little base and made the music "pHatt"

I was using Sennhieser HD-448s.I purchased this little amp through Amazon which it turns out was the right move since they issue call tickets for returns and it doesn't cost anything


Call me an idiot, but I am thinking of getting the E7 as a replacement just to improve the sound quality of my laptop.

$REVIEW.: My review based on using the Seagate Wireless Plus for a couple now.  I use it for videos and files storage for now. Having used and returning the GoFlex Satellite in the past, I can safely say Seagate has learned from their mistakes with that product.  Additionally, the overall look of the wireless plus is betterI have also used the Corsair Voyager Air and I would recommend the Seagate over the Corsair.  Corsair still has comes kinks to work out.Overview:No need to really go through what is in the box you can read that in the description.Transferring of video and larger  files via USB 3.0 is fast.  If you do not have any USB 3.0 ports the drive still works but the transfer is much slower.Seagate Wireless Plus has a DLNA server builtin so you can easily stream to your DLNA devices.Unlike the Corsair, Seagate does not have gigabit LAN port to this drive so it cannot be used as a standalone NAS.  I would assume most people looking to buy a Wifi hard drive are more interested in the streaming aspects of the drive.Seagate has a 10 hour battery life claim. I have not been on a long enough trip to prove otherwise.  I wish Seagate had added a battery life indicator with % left on the drive itself.  The Seagate Media App does provide a battery indicator with the app itself, which is great unless you are using a Windows laptop or tablet.Streaming:For my streaming test I used 4 different tablets.  1 - iPad, 1 - Windows 8 Pro tablet, and 1 - Android Tablets (10")Connecting the WiFi. After turning on the drive and wifi all tablets found the network and I was able to connect to the driveSeagate provides an app for IOS and Android but not Windows 8.  You just map a drive to the drive in Windows.The APP has a good interface with thumbnail previews. Having the thumbnails are great when you have younger kids who do not read yet, he or she can start the movie based on the image.  However; this is the little annoynance, you have to put an image in the folder of the movies and most of the text within the file name has to match the name of file.  Seems easy enough but it also has to be large enough of a file or the drive completely ignores the image.  Then you add the fact if you have a large amount of video files that the time to do this for every video file adds up. Maybe Seagate can add the ability to do a media lookup to something like freebase when the drive is connected to the computer.You need to use Seagate's media app to change SSID and password of wifi network.  I high recommend you do both.I started the stream on all 3 tablets.The stream  worked well on all devices without dropping.  The Corsair would work for about 20 minutes then to drop all the devices and happened multiple times.While I do not know product roadmap, one can assume Corsair will address any bugs that are discovered with a software update.I would recommend Seagate Wireless Plus to family and friendsI rate the device 4 1/2 stars.  I will update review and ratings if anything changes with this drive.

$REVIEW.: UPDATE - 11/20/2008Do your research before purchasing this router!  BUYER BEWARE!This router failed last week and has been replaced with a different brand
 It would not hold it's configuration after rebooting

 It appears there are issues with heat and slowly breaks down the components inside.I have sent it back to Belkin, and once the replacement arrives I'm selling it.END UPDATE - 11/20/2008This router replaced my D-Link DI-514, which was 802.11b


 I wanted at least a 802.11g with hopes to go to N someday


 Main hopes was to speed up connectivity to my work's VPN especially since all my PC's have wireless G cards

 More on the VPN in a moment.When I found this router, I fell in love, plus the coolness factor of the display sold me.It was a breeze to setup, even though I didn't use the built in "wizard"
 I've had network experience in the past, so it didn't bother me to do it the "hard" way

 I was able to update the pc's and laptops to use this router equally as painlessly

 Currently I have running on this router: Vista pc, XP pc, XP laptop, Macbook, iMac, PS3, PSP, and Nintendo DS
 All were very simple to get working with this router.Now for the "bad" but fixable problem

 It would NOT allow me to communicate via VPN to my corporate network using the Nortel Contivity client as I was able to do with my D-Link
 I e-mailed Belkin tech support and they said: "Problem solved in version 1.00.13 of the firmware, available from the Belkin UK Support Site."I updated to this firmware version and the VPN is working PERFECT!  Thanks Belkin!People have complained about Belkin tech support, but I was able to get my VPN working within two days of contacting them via e-mail


 I'm sure a phone call might have had a quicker resolution, but it wasn't a top priority to get the VPN working asap.Yeah, this router is a bit pricey, but it works well, and it sure is cool!  I haven't tested the range yet, but I rarely use my network outside of my house anyway.

$review_text.: I purchased these before a flight and van ride.  The earphones, when on, do amplify the volume from the music source AND do a noticeable job canceling the ambient noise, such as road noise and airplane engine noise.  The technology produces the inverse of the sounds it picks up at the ear buds, not the battery unit, so spoken word around you is conveyed even while the unit is on.  The plug design of the ear buds alone reduces a noticeable amount of external sound.  I do wish the frequency range for cancellation was more broad as there were ambient noises in the plane that were outside the response range- mostly the high frequency stuff.
$review_summary.: Very functional for the price

$review_text.: I've been wanting to buy this for awhile now, and I finally bit the bullet.  It arrived promptly.  Unbox, connected it to router and pop in the CD.  I'm a computer technician so most of this is easy to me.  I used the config tool on the CD and set the IP, port, username, and password.Remoted in via my browser and hit a snag.  You need to download drivers from the camera itself, which Norton identified as a virus (WS.Reputation1).  You only seem to need these drivers if you use IE (as the documentation recommends) but it seems to work fine in Chrome with no additional drivers.  Curious.Remoted into my router to set up port forwarding then went to whatsmyip.com and got my IP and plugged it into my iphone plus the port (EG: 12.34.56.78:80) and it worked fine.  Controls for iphone are very simple - wish it was a bit more robust.

With some research I knew I would have to replace the Y boards soon.  Not a huge deal right?  Well just the other week the whole thing died.  No video at all.  I took it down from the stand and what do I see? Without even opening the back cover I can see everything is melted inside.  Disappointing to say the least considering how much was spent on this TV less than 5 years ago.It will cost less to get a new Plasma then to fix this one.

$REVIEW.: This lens mount is great.It fits snug to the EF mount, and yes the MD side of the converter is a little (VERY little) loose. But i'm not 10 so I'm not going to cry about it. It stays on 97% with almost unnoticable wiggle. The reason I said it works 95% as promised is that it does extend the lens away from the sensor which does up the MM equivelent a little bit, for example a 50mm on an X-700 is now a 55 mm on a Canon EOS 300 which is a full frame film camera also, so there is no crop factor, which makes the images more up close. Quality is not at all lost to the extra glass in the converter, it's an amazing little piece of glass and metal. I would absolutely recommend this to a friend, and I (have) and will buy again from Fotodiox in the future.

$REVIEW.: I've been an electronics engineer for 25 years


I am fairly careful about choosing electronics for my personal use
I was purchasing a whole new theater system and based my decision on the Onkyo on two factors: 1) The specifications for the unit and my overall requirements for hdmi inputs/audio video capabilities etc, and 2) I trust HSU research and have used their products for years (they make astounding speaker systems) and HSU recommended Onkyo as a surround sound receiver.I have had my receiver for only a month

It took two full days to program the system, remotes, sound fields, and various other tweeks
I had it sounding perfect, and I was satisfied with the sound and switching performance
One morning, out of the blue, I switched on my system and there was no video output
I made several checks, and the video was dead from all possible outputs
No rhyme or reason to it.ONKY SUPPORT:What support? The folks they have on the other end of the phone may as well have been robots

The were of zero help
Parroting only what they are reading on the monitor in front of them, and barely speaking english I might add

I live in Boise, Idaho and as it turns out, there are no local service centers here
I had to send it to denver, CO (I had to find the service center myself because Onkyo could only tell me to send it to Missouri)

In short, their support is non-existant, and even more frustrating, It has been out for repair for longer than I have actually owned it.Conclusion: Don't buy from Onkyo for any reason
They suck.

$review_text.: I bought my first Apple computer, a Mac Plus, in early 1986.  I had to preorder and wait in a waiting list for about a month.  It was extremely slow and ran from only a single floppy, but I loved it.  I switched to PC's after that and had a sparcstation at one point.  I bought my second Apple computer at an Apple store exactly 25 years later in 2011.  That was a Macbook Air 11.  Interestingly that one had a flawed keyboard, a couple of keys went dead after a few hours of use, and I took it back to the Apple store.  They had never seen that before, nor had I read about such a problem online, but they gave me a new one and I have been very happy with it ever since.  But would that suffice for another 25 years?Answer: no.  I bought my third Apple computer, the new MacBook Air 11 from Amazon about two weeks ago.  It has a 64GB internal SSD and 4GB RAM (it's the lowest end model).  It uses the new Ivy Bridge chipset (core i5 instead of the old core 2 in the old MacBook) and new Intel graphics chip, and it shows with a noticeable performance improvement running all types of software.  USB 3.0 is a plus for me right now, and thunderbolt will be in the future as soon as I buy the thunderbolt to gigabit ethernet dongle (I am using my old USB to 100 Mbit ethernet dongle for now).  The display is virtually the same as the old model.  The lighted keyboard is awesome, I wish I had that on the old one.  The new magsafe 2 connector is a little disappointing since I needed to buy a $10 (Apple store) adapter to reuse my old power supplies.  Also the 180 degree connector falls out much more easily than the 90 degree connector on my old MacBook.  But I have gotten used to that.The new USB 3.0 ports are very helpful.  Copying lots of files from an ADATA Pro USB 3.0 flash drive to the MacBook's internal SSD is still a bit slow: 1519 files (67 MB total) in 9.251 seconds.  But a single 23.8 MB file takes 0.328 seconds.  The same two operations on the old MacBook which has USB 2.0 take 28.456 seconds and 1.86 seconds respectively.  So USB 3.0 is 3-5 times faster depending on what you are copying.  In the other direction it took 1.342 seconds to copy 23.8MB from the internal SSD to the ADATA drive on the new MacBook and 2.891 on the old.  So the new one is roughly twice as fast but keep in mind that writing USB flash is the bottleneck there, not the USB.Next I'd like to talk about Windows.  I realize this may be heresy here, but for work purposes I decided to dual boot my new MacBook with Windows 7.  I use VMWare Fusion on the old one and that works very well, but mostly I don't need to run both OS's at the same time and need all the speed and RAM I can get for Windows development.  As I said above, I purchased the lowest end 64 GB model and it is very important not to fill an SSD.  I like to keep them less than half full and I aim at keeping them 1/3 full.  That means essentially 10 GB for MacOS in a 30GB partition and 10GB for Windows 7 in a 30GB partition.  For MacOS that meant getting rid of a bunch of brickabrack like Garage Band.  But I can easily browse and even develop SW in 10GB.  On my old MacBook which has a 128GB SSD, I use 30GB for MacOS including the iWork suite (word processor, etc) but that also includes 14GB for a Windows disk running in Fusion.  Since I am only about 1/4 full I have room for another VM and more SW.Windows 7 installed like a dream using Mac's upgraded Boot Camp.  Simply create a bootable USB flash drive from a Windows 7 ISO file.  Then download the many drivers that Apple supplied for Windows to support their hardware.  That's a large download because it has all drivers for all hardware.  Then install Windows and install the drivers in two easy steps. There is a caveat for running Windows on the Air 11, I get about 5 hours battery life doing virtually nothing (reading and minor editing).  It drops to 4 hours going online with light browsing and some flash disk usage.  I have read that the battery life under MacOS is much better, about 6 hours, but I have not tested that.  The reason is that despite Apple's efforts with their drivers, Microsoft does not optimize battery life as well as Apple.  Apple simply does a much better job of turning off or turning down their hardware when it is not needed.One other note, the trackpad is the best one I have ever tried.  It works a little differently on Windows however, the gestures are much pronounced and you have to develop a very light touch otherwise your two finger scroll will be much too fast.  Then you have to adapt when switching back to MacOS.  With that in mind and considering battery life with raw Windows, I would probably recommend most people buy and use Fusion unless they need all the memory for Windows.  One other note on that: the graphics drivers appear to capture a large amount of RAM for their use leaving 2.2GB out of 4 GB for Windows.  I may be able to reduce that but have not tried yet.The bottom line is this is great piece of hardware with some very nice software.  Try to keep your SSD usage down because it helps with the wear leveling.  So buy a couple of USB 3.0 thumb drives or a nice 3.0 external drive and keep your data files (documents, music, video, etc) off of the main drive.  You can run Windows 7 on it but you will take a hit in battery life.  Most of all, enjoy, because you can't help but enjoy using this computer.
$SUMMARY.: Newest Air better than the first.

$REVIEW.: The Duo Pinball for the iPad is a whole lot of fun for pinball players


 You get the feel of pulling the lever to shoot the ball and clicking the buttons to use the flippers


 It really takes Pinball HD to a new level (5 to be exact)
 The device is rather simple to use and to pair with your ipad - simply take it out of the box, add batteries and set your ipad to pair with the duo thru bluetooth and you are ready to go

 The app you use this device with is free (not just for DUo owners) and comes with 5 different pinball "boards" - after that there is a charge to get new levels
 Personally, we thought this game was a lot of fun and enjoyed the Duo but it is far too costly for what it is and for the fact that it works with only one app

 The device is rather bulky but well built, you almost get the sensation of trying to bump the machine to get the ball to move!If this cost was lower, I would buy them as gifts for friends as it was tons of fun but beware that the fun does cost you extra if you decide to add new levels (which I think the Duo should include for free if one has already paid for the Duo Pinball).

$SUMMARY.: a lot of fun but costly and only good for one game....

$REVIEW.: I own a 10D which I absolutely love  and was getting tired of using my old Olympus Epic (a GREAT film camera) and was looking for a good digital point and shoot.  My two major candidates were the S400 and the S50.If you follow the photography boards at all you realize that this is a fairly common dilemma - the S400 vs the S50.  The S50 offers excellent manual controls while the S400 is significantly smaller without any manual control whatsoever other than exposure compensation.  I just LOVE the look and feel of the S400 though if anything it could be argued that it is TOO small.  If you feel it is and you are looking for a carry everywhere camera it is well worth the effort to get used to the small size because the camera takes beautiful pictures.The S400 is simply beautiful.  I can live without all the manual controls since I own the 10D and since this camera is primarily for my wife and for me when I don't want to lug the 10D around.Several have pointed out that since this camera is so small it will always be with you whereas the S50 would be less likely to be carried along because of its increased size.  This is a very good argument!  The camera is SUBSTANTIALLY smaller than its bigger brother the S50.  The form and size factors are what finally won me over.One criticism of the camera.  Low light focusing is less than ideal.  You need to work with the camera to understand its limitations indoors.I am a huge fan of the Canon cameras and I would advise anyone looking for a camera, whether a point and shoot or a DSLR to carefully consider the Canon line since, in my opinion, Canon  currently represents the state of the art.
$SUMMARY.: This camera is simply exquisite!

$review_text.: Anker gave me this product in exchange for my honest feedback.This 4 port USB hub comes packaged with a USB cord, A/C adapter and an instruction booklet. The USB hub seems to be made well and doesn't appear to be made cheaply at all. It's compact, black and has a modern look to it. It has four USB ports on the front and an additional full power USB charging port on the side. When you plug devices into the front then a blue LED light will illuminate for each device that is plugged in. If you only want to use it to charge then you can plug the A/C cord into the wall and into the USB hub and then plug your device into the hull power port on the side and charge devices like iPad, iPhone or any other device that charges via USB cord. You can also connect it to your PC with the enclosed USB cord and use it both for additional USB ports and for charging a USB device. However the power cord is very short and not convenient considering it won't work just by USB power and you have to plug in the power adapter too. The power plug also wiggles a lot where it's plugged into the wall. I actually noticed it spark once because it moved too much. I am using it on a laptop that is running windows 7 and usually when you install these types of devices it will install the drivers in about 20 seconds. The first time I installed this hub it took several minutes while it searched for drivers. Finally it installed them and then it had to reboot my computer as well. I have also noticed that if you change which devices are hooked up to the hub then my laptop searches for drivers every time and there is a brief amount of time that everything stops working. This USB hub isn't bad but there are a few frustrating things about it. I have sent my suggestions to the manufacturer so hopefully they will take note for future products.

 Not a problem when near a wall plug, but what do you do when you are not near one

 Did a lot of research on various products and read other peoples reviews
 Then solved the problem with my new Trent iMirror 6000mAh

 Works like a charm


 Easy to set up and easy to operate


 Never leave home without it

 Also works on my iPad, but have not had needed to use it with the iPad as the battery life is so much better

$REVIEW.: We bought this lens a month ago for my wife's Olympus E620

Hands down the sharpest lens we own

 We have a photography business and the photos we have made from this lens have got us 5 Referrals in less than 3 weeks! This lens is sharp, sharp, sharp

The focus is dead on, albeit a little slow
It does tend to hunt a smidge
It is a bit noisy as well

For macros and portraits there is no beating this lens.If I could I'd give this lens a 4.7 for the slow AF and the VERY minor hunting issue


Since I can't, it gets a 5

In the end it's about image quality and this lens cannot be beat


It paid itself off in 3 shoots
This lens is now our #1 go-to lens for portraits


The money we are now making with this lens is being used to buy our next lens


For all Olympus shooters this lens is an absolutely-positively, must have lens.UPDATEAfter further investigation I found out that [...] considers this one of the sharpest lenses EVER made


We mostly shoot f2.8-4

The lens is sharpest at f4
The sharpness will blow your mind


If all you have is the kit lens, this lens should be the second lens you buy

It will revamp you photography and get you really excited about it
We love this lens!!UPDATE 2After more than a year and a half of ownership this lens has saved our photographic bacon more times than I can count so I can say it is reliable


Like I said before, this should be in every Oly owners kit
After shooting with this lens you'll never want to shoot with your 14-42mm kit lens again.

$review_text.: I needed a new receiver (my Rotel was 15 years old and showing its age) and waited impatiently for the 1020 to become available for purchase. My choice was based on two factors: the price was right, and the 1019 had received excellent reviews. So wouldn't the 1020 be as good or even better?Overall, I have no major complaints. The receiver is not difficult to set up. I used the included mike to calibrate the surround sound and the balance is superb.So why not five stars? There is an incorrect claim made that in addition to an I-pod, you also can use an MP3 player to listen to music through the receiver. Being Apple-adverse, I have my music loaded onto a Creative Zen.Despite reading the manual closely, I could not figure out how I connected my Zen to this receiver. There is no dedicated audio-in jack. So I called Pioneer and a representative told me that I used the USB on the front of the receiver just the same way I would if I was burning music off my computer.Only it didn't work. The Pioneer said it did not recognize the device. I called back, of course, only to be informed by someone else that this receiver did not in fact recognize every MP3 player and if didn't recognize mine, well, you're out of luck.So if being able to connect an MP3 player is a factor in a purchase of this receiver, you have been warned. But, otherwise, as I said, I have no complaints and really would give the Pioneer VSX-1020 4 1/2 stars if the Amazon rating system allowed it.

$REVIEW.: I'm a digital artist, so I've been drooling over the thought of having a tablet I could draw on. I hate the capacitive touch screens for drawing as I'm used to using a Wacom tablet, so nothing out there was ever up to par for what I wanted to do.Then came the ThinkPad. A friend of mine bought it for himself and I started to play with it. He never really used it, so I got it as a Christmas present. And I can honestly say I haven't drawn as much since I graduated from art school.The lag issues that others have pointed out seem to have been resolved with the ICS update, so I can't comment on that very much. My ThinkPad is as snappy as ever, even when I have multiple apps open.And with the latest updates to SketchBook Pro I can now disable touch input for drawing on the canvas. I can still pan and zoom with my fingertips, but I don't have to worry about my palm making a mark that I didn't want to be there.The tablet itself also has the option to completely turn off the touch and use the pen only. Needless to say, this is SUPER convenient.But there has been one minor issue. I say minor because I'm a techie and decided to fix the issue myself. But the power button stopped working (this is after 13 months of use) - it turns out that the solders for the power switch on the board had snapped. I had to re-solder the switch back on myself since the warranty had expired 1 month prior.This could have been a pretty big problem for somebody who is uncomfortable playing with a circuit board, so I recommend you take your tablet to a certified repair tech if this happens. If you can explain exactly what the issue is (based on this review), they should be able to identify and repair the problem fairly quickly, saving you some moneys.Still, this is the absolute best tablet for drawing, so I'll take it with that one minor flaw. No problem!

$REVIEW.: I hate fingerprints and glare with a passion!. I've used Power Support anti-glare films on my last 2 iPhones, and loved them, so of course I wanted one for my new 3rd generation iPad.When the 3rd generation iPad was released this past March, Power Support was advertising their iPad 2 films as fitting both the 2 and the 3. Then, in April, they released new films specifically optimized for the Retina display on the 3rd generation iPad. It was clear from the reviews that at least some people got the older film when ordering from Amazon. So to be on the safe side, I ordered mine direct from Power Support's USA website.If you subscribe to Power Support's newsletter, you will get discount codes on the first Friday of every month. Sometimes you can find these codes by searching the web or on Facebook. The discount almost makes up for the lack of free shipping, so buying direct from PS is just slightly more expensive than from Amazon.I was able to persuade the Genius Bar in my local Apple store to install my film for me, even though I didn't buy it from them. They did a beautiful installation job. They aren't really supposed to do this, so it might not work for you, but if you live near an Apple store it can't hurt to ask.I am pretty happy with my film. It seems to reduce glare by about 90%. There is still some glare visible, but it isn't objectionable. I don't see any fingerprints, unless my fingers are really slimy. If I do get visible gunk from my fingers on the film, it cleans up easily with a damp cloth. There is no loss of touch-screen responsiveness through the film.When I compare my 3rd generation iPad with another that doesn't have any film on it, I see a slight loss of sharpness, for which I deducted one star from this review. There is no visible loss of brightness, distortion, or prismatic effects.So, if you want the absolutely sharpest image from your iPad's Retina display, don't get this film. However, if you are willing to accept a slight reduction in sharpness to avoid fingerprints and glare, then you will be very happy with this film.

$review_text.: I am a radio nut (going back to the tube days)and the Squeezebox Boom is my third internet radio. I have a Roku Soundbridge R1000 and Sangean WFR-20 as well.  All have their strengths, but the Squeezebox Boom is without a doubt a significant step up; it sets a new high standard in performance, capabilities, and ease of operation.For wireless streaming of your music collection from a PC or Mac, the Boom is best. It can handle more formats (nearly anything except DRM protected iTunes files) and works well without crashes or delays.  In this the Roku is #2, and the Sangean ranks 3rd(crashes and stutters a lot).For internet radio, they all work well. The Sangean is the only one that natively handles RealAudio Streams (like BBC) but has problems with clear channel stations.  All of them pick up the stations I want without problems, so I rate this a tie.If you want to interface with online music services like Rhapsody/Pandora/ MP3Locker etc, the Boom works great, with far more capacity than the other two. The Slimdevices/Squeezebox folks also update and improve their software far more frequently than the other two, so I expect it to remain in the lead in features and available services.In sound quality, the Roku and Boom are both outstanding, with the Sangean good, but clearly a step lower.  The Roku's subwoofer seems to go a bit deeper in my room, but the Boom is perhaps a bit more smooth and musical. The Boom uses the same woofers and tweeters as the highly rated Logitech Z-10, but with better bass (because of a larger cabinet and new amp/equalizer circuitry). They both sound absolutely great and play quite loud.Ease of initial setup: If you are starting from scratch, I think the Sangean is the easiest to set up, if you do NOT want to stream audio from your PC...that is a real hassle.  Both the Boom and Roku require a bit more work.Ease of Use AFTER set up:  Boom is best BY FAR.  Not only do the menus make real sense, but the illuminated controls make it the only radio you can use easily without turning on the lights.  The big control knob and back lit function buttons get you through all of the functions fast.As a Clock Radio, the Boom has more options than the others, and the display has a huge adjustment range so it will not disturb light sleepers.All of these radios are a lot of fun.  The Boom does most, and does it best.

$REVIEW.: The most puzzling aspect of this NAS is that it has dual ethernet ports that are configurable in several different ways yet it lacks the transfer speed to take advantage of them.  On large file transfers I was topping out at about 40MB/s speeds. On the same network, and a few switch hops away I was getting twice that connecting to a different NAS or a PC.  Performance was ahead of a significantly older NAS device, but not by much.Aside from performance issues, there is a lot to like here.  There are many built in applications and plenty of 3rd party applications as well.  The user interface is polished and easy to navigate.  Connecting a phone or tablet is very simple as well.  Other than the speed concerns I like this device a lot.The bottom line with this device is that it trades an abundance of features for speed.  Possibly its due to the use of a single core CPU.  If so, there isn't much hope for a fix.  Still, if speed is not a priority then this is a great option because of its utility.

$review_text.: I have been using my SimpleTV  STV-1000 for a month now. In some ways, this is a good device and in others, an exercise in frustration.  In general, the guide and recording of scheduled shows from it is very good and easy to use. I like the ability to schedule new shows only, for example, and the search function also comes in handy. Where the guide lets me down is that a couple of my favorite channels, 5.2 and 34.3 Atlanta area OTA channels, are never listed despite being strong, easy to tune, channels.  Whether the issue is the tuner or just the guide info I'm not sure. They are just never there after a channel scan.  I have looked for alternative frequencies being picked up instead, but I can't locate them. There is also no way to add them manually for tuning or recording purposes so I am just out of luck. Fortunately, my TV as well as my Magnavox DVDR receives them just fine so I have a workaround.Another issue I have had is that the playback occasionally freezes.  Trying pause/start and even skipping forward/back doesn't get it playing again. I have to exit to the My Shows section for that recording and then go back again to watch that particular recording. It generally picks up again just fine unless the computer has to be forced out of the frozen playback by using the Windows attention key. Once you have to force it out, it starts only from the beginning of the recording and you need to manually fast forward to where it stopped. So far, the freezing has never reoccurred the second time at the same spot.Speaking of fast forwarding and reversing, the functionality is poor because there is no displayable playback during the forward or reverse and you need to guess where you are by clicking on the crude timeline or using the forward 30 seconds/reverse 5 seconds controls. Those latter controls also seem to be inaccurate and frequently add to user frustration by their inexactness.Recording quality is definitely not always optimal.  Although a good quality HD channel can look very good on playback, sub channels at 480I are typically worse than with the TV alone or even the SD quality Magnavox recorder display. There is some indication in the documentation that the SimpleTV simultaneously records 3 resolution levels and plays back only the most reliable level but I'm frequently disappointed when comparing the real world quality of the recordings to the Magnavox.The required usage of an Internet browser to do anything is also a big negative to my mind. Adding another level of complication to an already borderline user interface is just plain bad design. I get occasional errors and have to exit & get into the browser again. Reliability is not this device's forte.Bottom line is that if you get the SimpleTV with the lifetime Premier guide at the recent Woot price, it is a worthwhile purchase. Beyond that, it's not anything I would recommend.Update 03/04/2014: I finally figured out how to get my missing channels. I had to go to the TVFOOL website and look through their listing for the Atlanta OTA market to identify the "real" channels as opposed to the virtual. I could then go back to the SimpleTV and remap the real/virtual channels missing from the guide info. This is under Settings/Guide and choosing the channel to remap then select it from All Available Channels. I still don't understand the difficulty in finding the correct channels initially since other subchannels and primaries were all OK. Anyway, I needed to remap 5.2, 17.1, 34.3 and 46.1. The unexpected surprise is that the SimpleTV guide is now even more accurate and complete than the TVGuide site for scheduling info - at least for the Atlanta market. For example, 34.3 is not `even listed by TVGuide and 32.2 consistently shows incorrect programming. The superior guide capability makes me raise my review by one star.

$review_text.: You get 320GB of storage in something roughly the size of a trifold wallet (actually, my wallet is thicker).  Comes in a rubber cover that feels quite durable -- but I didn't test by dropping it ... :-)Copy-in speed from my laptop was about 18MB/sec; copy-out speed was about 26MB/sec.  I find both quite satisfactory.Also comes with some software, which I don't care about, and did not use.I also did not test the Turbo USB software; some reviews I've read say that the speed increase can be abour 25%.  But there wasn't enough technical information provided about compatibility for me to feel comfortable installing it.  I think this is a deficiency, but I'm not rating the software, just rating the drive as an external drive, so not docking any points for this.I like this enough that I might get another, I can think of many uses.  I have other external drives, but the compact size is the winner here.

$REVIEW.: Amazon comes through with an amazing deal for a phone that gets the basics of a smart device, down pat.I am a T-Mobile customer who has never had an interest in breaking the bank for a cell phone. That said, I couldn't justify shopping T-Mobile's online storefront, only to find the most basic of smart phones running well over $100. So, for the first time ever, I did some shopping at Amazon to search for a phone that suits my needs without dumping loads of cash into one.Quickly, I found the Nokia Lumia 521 to be at a surprisingly great price for a phone that stakes big claims in capability. As I stated earlier, I am an existing T-Mobile customer with a plan that I had no intentions of changing. Because this purchase comes with no contract obligation, this was the perfect fit for me and any T-Mobile customer who is looking to just own a new phone.Once it arrived, the transfer from one device to the Lumia 521 was seamless. I previously owned a phone that utilized the larger SIM card; but, fortunately, the Lumia 521 included the new micro SIM card. The cost to swap SIM cards? $0. The time spent on the phone with customer service to swap SIM cards? Not a single second. Current T-Mobile users can use their TMobile.com online account access to switch SIM cards by simply typing the number supplied with the Lumia 521's SIM card! So much ease!Now, weeks later, I have used this phone for social media access, internet surfing, phone calls, text messaging and more - all with no troubles what-so-ever. Needless to say, this was exactly the phone I was looking for - it performs extremely well and at a price tag well below $100, I highly recommend this device to anyone who wants smart phone capabilities coupled with affordability.Furthermore, I should add that my previous phone was formatted with the Andriod operating system - something that I very much enjoyed. So, I was a bit apprehensive knowing that the Lumia 521 employed a Windows OS. That said, my experince with it has been nothing but positive. Only two downsides about this phone: 1) the three function keys at the bottom of the device do not light up, 2) this device, in order to cut expenses, does not have a compass (it does feature GPS, however) that would be useful with some navigation applications. Other than those findings, navigation is a breeze, customizing the tile layout is superb, and the phone processes actions with very little effort.Additionally: the screen is nicely lit, the battery has a good lifecycle, and the phone sports the level of sleekness reminiscent of its more expensive Nokia family members.Overall, this phone and the Amazon discount offer the best bang for the buck - that I am aware of - in this day and age of cell phones! If you are a current or prospective T-Mobile customer and would like to save some serious cash without comprimising quality, look no further than the Lumia 521.

$review_text.: I had an issue about months ago with my Motorola SB6121 after some use ..
all the sudden I would lose connection for a few minutes then it was back Over & Over & Over ...
had them replace EVERYTHING in my house ..


new wire from street to house from outside through the house into my office to my modem ...

So I told them to just give me one of their crappy modems and I was good to go for a while.So I decided well I just had a bad one no biggie ..
and now they have the brand new Motorola SB6141 that's a bit future proof so I thought heck ya let me give that one a try since I don't want to pay Comcast for their old one they gave me.Bought the SB6141 and 2 days later ..


Boom ..

drops off for a few minutes then back up, then off for a few minutes then back up .

over and over ..
and later in the night it would drop off completely for a while then come back


Weird thing the modem's lights stayed like normal and the signal lights looked like all was good but it wasn't.HmmmmmmmmSo I decided to dig around and research on Comcast /Xfinity and Motorola SB6141 and 6121 modems and Low And Behold there is TONS AND TONS of issues just like mine All OVER the Internet!And reading through a bunch of things I kept seeing this Zoom Modem being recommended and people saying my SB6141 sucked and lost connection constantly and after getting the Zoom Zero issues
So I found it locally here at BB for 70 bucks and thought before I bring more techs out I'll try it.For Days and Days now late at night my internet was DONE ..
dropping off, resetting, and losing connection all together.Zoom 5341j has been connected all day and all night and 100% ZERO ISSUES ANYMORE!I know it's only one night (I will be sure to come back and update) but I know Dang well that if my SB6141 was still connected my whole house would have been down again tonight.This Zoom modem I guess works better with connections that are not perfect and may have noise and slight connection issues (not sure what you would call em' I read about what they are but don't remember) ....

Many who have no issues with the Motorola Surfboard line may have rock solid zero interruption or flawed signals ...

Many do not and if you have any kind of connection issues or errors or constant reboots or restarts then BUY THIS MODEM!So happy I decided to research and fix this issue myself by finding this new modem.Great looking little no frills modem that just plain WorksAnd when I called to have this thing activated (which took about 5 mins after I got a rep ..
very quick and easy) ..
he made it a point to tell me that he likes these Zoom modems and knows How Well they work and how stable they are and he gets TONS of service calls for the Motorola stuff but hardly Ever Ever gets a service issue with a customer using one of these modems.Looks like I Finally got a modem that works and works well with all kinds of connections and is Also like the SB6141 Future proof with the 8 Bonding down and IPV6 support!If you are having issues with your cable internet connection where it loses connection many times a day for no reason then comes back like it's timing out and also loses connection all together then Buy This Modem (do some searching on SB6141 (or 6121) Timeouts (it's mostly something called a T3 Timeout seems like)  ..
you will see what I'm talking about  ..

you will save TONS of time troubleshooting with Comcast and I think overall just get a better overall cable modem.Hope this reviewed has helped anyone who has the same issue as me ..

feel free to comment and I will answer any questions you may have.I will be back with update!UPDATE: ...

A few days later and the Zoom modem is AMAZING! I had days and days of issues with this SB6141 running on my local Comcast cable connection ...


I haven't dropped a single second or any timeouts AT ALL since I got the Zoom.Glad to see many are able to use this but if you run into this issue It's gonna be the modem ...
my old SB6121 worked for like 6+ plus like a champ then one day it was timing out like Crazy ..


turned out after Comcast provided me a modem the issue went away ..

didn't wanna pay for their modem so I thought I would try this SB6141 since it's all new ..
Got it on a Friday morning and installed and it ran Solid till Monday night (4 days later) then low and behold drop-offs, timeouts and loss of connection EVERY DAY ...
got smart and researched and found the Zoom ...

YA I am DONE with Motorola SB now for sure
After researching online they are NOT a quality modem.Like I said hope it all works great for everyone but if you ever run into this timeout issue at some point save yourself the many many local cable company trips to your house and just dump your Moto SB and get the Zoom or something different.ANOTHER UPDATE A couple weeks later: SOLID!!!! Don;'even bother with the Moto SB if you are having the same issues or ever have the issues in the future

This thing has not skipped a beat and has ZERO errors

I will update a couple months as well but I finally know now my internet will finally be interruption free after buy the Zoom Modem

(Thank Goodness)

$review_text.: I hestiated when buying this because some of the description does not list P7000 but the title does


Also when you get the item it again doesn't list the P7000


Also the P7000 is not a DSLR

But it is made by Amazon and right there in the title, so I thought they should know.It does indeed work with the P7000
You have to make sure you choose one of the correct timing options which is located to the left on the menu wheel in back
You can select 2 second, 10 second, or just shoot options

I like that you still have some delay options so you can put the remote away and get into a more natural position
Nice additional item for the P7000 for getting the whole family in a shot.

$review_text.: I bought two of these and they work well. I just wanted to add a note that the mount plate is just about 36mm square, and also that it has bevels on all four edges so that you can insert you camera on one orientation, or on the 90 degree angle as well.I bought these without knowing this, thinking that it might just fit into an older Cullman tripod with a similar shaped square mount system, or that they might be interchangeable with the quick release on the cheap little Cowboy Studio $15 micro tripod I bought at the same time. They are all different sizes however. The Cullman plates are about 40mm square, the Sima plates are 36mm, and the Cowboy is about 37. So no luck there, but there was a solution.I eventually settled on using these Sima 36mm plates and adapting the other receivers with shims glued in place. It took a bit of work in the shop but after about 1-1/2 hours I now have no less than 7 quick mount receivers on various kinds of tripods, dollies, monopod, micro steadicam etc, and can mount two different cameras quick as a wink on any of those seven holders.Personally I feel that all cameras should come with a quick mount plate like this, the square shape with all four beveled edges makes the most sense, and that the industry should settle on one or two standard sizes for cameras of different weights. It's just so dumb to be constantly screwing and unscrewing your camera to a tripod when something like this is so quick and simple. I wish my camera just had one molded into its body.As for the Sima hockey puck, I'd say it's pretty solid for smaller cameras up to medium size SLRs. It could have a bit of a lower profile but it's not a big deal. The plastic seems to be pretty tough stuff, probably ABS. I paid $15 which is a little bit much, but a lot easier than fabricating your own (which I've done before I discovered these things.)
$SUMMARY.: It has a 36mm square plate for those of you wondering

$REVIEW.: The first, obvious, aspect of this lens is its tiny size. You might wonder what the point is in pairing a tiny lens with a large heavy dSLR (I have it on the 7D), but it's great. The point isn't to make the package lighter or even, really, smaller. Rather it makes the camera _flatter_. On my 7D, this lens hardly extends out from under the viewfinder/flash "hump" on the top or the grip on the right. That moves the camera from an awkward 3D object toward something with the profile of a lumpy, dense book. Much easier to place in a standard shoulder bag or backpack. Having this lens sitting on your camera makes it that much more likely that you'll throw it in your bag when you go out (and then have it on you when you see that great thing you want to photograph). It isn't going to make a big dSLR portable, but it will make it _possible_ to take it with you many times when you otherwise couldn't.So, if it's going to be sitting on your camera, how good is it? Will you regret that it was the only lens you had with you when you went out? As a prime lens, you obviously won't be able to zoom, but don't forget that modern dSLRs have a lot of resolution to burn in cropping. 40mm is a decent all around lens. On crop sensors (Rebels, 60D, 7D, etc.) it acts as a slightly wide portrait lens or a slightly zoomed in standard (acting about like a 64mm) and on full frame cameras it will give you a nice slightly wide standard. Some people have expressed doubt about the utility on crop sensors, but I think it's pretty good. It's a good length for head and shoulder portraits at comfortable distances and while you won't capture a full room with it, it is wide enough that you can get two or three people in frame if you have some room to back up. You'll find it a bit tight as a walk around lens if you like to take pictures of large features on buildings on the same side of the street as you (like stairs or doorways), but it is a great length for capturing smaller details while still being wide enough to be useful at capturing a more distant vista across the street (just don't count on showing a full building). In short, a compromise, but a decent one.At f 2.8 you won't be taking pictures in the dark without high ISO, but it is entirely useable indoors at night, and if you are capturing a close portrait it will blur the background nicely, but there is no competing with a 1.4 or even 1.8. The better news is that it is quite sharp all the way open at 2.8. Certainly sharp enough that you won't notice any problems unless you really go hunting for them. Any trade-offs made to make it so small are less than those needed to make zoom lens. If you are used to a kit zoom, you will find this incredibly sharp. Similarly the quality of the background blur is a decided step up from entry level. Optically, you won't find anything to fault unless you go looking for it.Likewise, the build quality is great for the price. With so little length there isn't much room for flex. The focus ring is small, but solid, and it turns easily without making any rubbing sound. The STM motor is quiet, but definitely not silent. It's similar to a USM motor, but with more of a "zip" sound rather than the stuttering beeping slipping sound of USM. It is fast enough that, again, you won't notice. If you are taking video and you move the focus ring very, very, slowly, it will move silently or with just an occasional click, but if you turn it quickly, it will produce a zip that will be audible with the internal mic.Little details: The aperture adjusts slowly when in video mode on my camera, making it silent (one of my other lenses, snaps between aperture settings with an audible click) and presumably less sudden in lighting transition. Full time manual focus is a little strange due to focus by wire. If you have your camera controls set up in the default fashion, you can't just grab the ring at any time and have the lens move, you have to engage focusing first. So, for instance, if you push the shutter half way and allow it to lock focus in one shot mode, you can then move the focus while you keep the shutter pressed. In other words it will work great for post-autofocus adjustments, but not for pre-focusing to start the autofocus from a reasonable point. This is mostly frustrating in video where in order to manually adjust your focus, you will need to switch to manual mode, making it hard to pre-focus with autofocus, then manual focus while recording without hitting the switch (and probably moving the camera in the process). That said, you can fix this (at least on the 7D) by changing the half-pressed shutter to something like "metering start" instead of "AF start" and using the back AF-on button to focus. In that mode, manual focus works truly full time. To take advantage of this, I have one of my Custom User Mode settings set up for video, including that control change so that video mode allows constant focus override while normal picture taking is unaffected.Bottom line: At a price that makes it one of the cheapest Canon lenses available, this provides an interesting choice against the cheapest lens, the 50mm 1.8. With this lens you get a similar, but slightly wider, lens with somewhat better optical quality, vastly better fit, finish, and durability, much better background blur quality (though less quantity), and even better portability (almost flat package and no fear of snapping off that plastic mount putting this in a bag). What you lose is that wide open 1.8. Personally this makes the 40mm the winner for the spot of "default low cost lens that sits on my camera." For a wide open lens, I'll save for one of the 1.4s instead.
$SUMMARY.: Great lens to leave on your camera.

The cover has a magnetic closure, so need to do snaps or velcro or the like.The keyboard battery recharges via MicroUSB, so since those are fairly ubiquitous, that's one less charger to keep plugged in.The tablet is supported as illustrated in the picture, but, as to be expected, not with the tablet's case installed. So I use the tablet's case to keep the tablet standing and simply fold over the cover underneath the keyboard and use the keyboard &#34;flat&#34; right in front of the tablet. It works well this way, even on a lap.

$REVIEW.: I have had this camera for a year now and after many other digital cameras this is the best I have ever had. Many people have complained about the pop of flash but I really like it I don't have to go through a bunch of steps not to have flash I just close it or open it. It is amazing in low light and the zoom is fantastic. This camera has fulfilled most of my desires for a camera and still is small enough to pack around with out being in the way. It is very user friendly.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this LED Light for my daughter for Christmas to use with her Sony Camcorder. I was not sure how bright the light was, but could not find any information online that told me how many LED's are needed. I did go to Best Buys and they only had one LED light available. It had only 9 LEDs and was very cheap looking. I inquired with the sale people there and could not answer if that light was sufficient for my purposes. So I ordered it knowing that if it was not right I could return it, Amazon is a great company and stands by their merchandise. WOW, the amount of light is great !!! It is light weight, adjustable, and has 3 filters for all different photo options. It does not get hot since it is LED. Great product, love it. I had called Sony and they had told me that I could not use a light with this camcorder because it did not have a "hot shoe". Well guess what, I purchased the bracket that fits on the tripod screw, this light runs on rechargeable batteries and AA batteries. Sony was sooo wrong. And you can still use a tripod with the bracket. I am ordering one for myself and my son. Can't say enough about it.

$review_text.: Every few years, I buy another media player and get my hopes dashed again.  The Media Lounge is down there with the rest of them.  The software that comes with it is good for streaming stuff that's on your hard drive.  Many of the rest of 'picks' are pay-for items--some of which have already been beaten to death.  If never see the Napster logo again it'll be too soon....  Tversity, a separate product, improves the 520.  It allows you to stream content from the Internet.  Hulu is what I was really interested in.  But the codecs in the 520 are so out of date that Hulu refuses to stream.  Another disappointment:I have an mt-daap server sitting right next to the thing and it can't see it/doesn't know anything about it.  So, in summary, I'd say that the Media Lounge would be a good fit for someone who really doesn't want it to do anything.

$review_text.: I have bought (seller: mCover) a blue color Hard Case for my Makbook Pro 13". It's really easy to place it on my laptop. I feel more protected while working on it and leaving it at home with my 3 years old daughter. After applying this, I feel more secure for it's outside body and dust. On my old Toshiba laptop there were lot of scratched on its body (not to mention some of them were made my my little princess), but on macbook now I could save it for at least one or two years. The quality and fitting is really nice. Though nothing is perfect, it's lock which bind it with body are a little filmsy (one of the side lock did not looked well), I tried a lot to fix it with body but did not get any success. The case has samll stand/legs which keeps it about an inch up to pass air, which is nice feature.The case it devided into two parts, upper half stick to top side lid of laptop and bottom half goes under the base. Overall its really nice and sturdy case to save investment.

$review_text.: I like the tone of green with this one, probably because it's a closer match to my editor's green without a lot of trial-and-error. That being said, the construction is good and I would purchase again.Like all backdrops - and especially with a green screen - make sure you steam out the fold lines when it is delivered. I missed just a bit of one fold line and it showed up in the first test run. Once it was steamed again, it worked great and this is now my primary green screen.

$review_text.: I was initially very impressed with the FI8906W, until I purchased a Foscam FI9805W to supplement this camera
 As they presently overlap, I am able to compare the two

 The FI9805W is much sharper, as it is 960P HD
I can see blades of grass, not just a green blend of grass, as is the case with the FI8906W
The IR on the  FI9805W is MUCH clearer than the FI8906W, even at 100 feet

The FI9805W has a 70 degree viewing angle, where the FI8906W has a 55 degrees
This is quite noticeable.I still struggle somewhat with setup on both models


However, that is more a Blue Iris critique, but worth mentioning as many will use this with BlueIris.As I continue to add cameras to my system, I will be buying more of the FI9805W, instead of the FI8906W.


$review_summary.: Good camera, I like FI9805W better.

$REVIEW.: I own two of these Harmony 650 remotes (living room and bedroom).  One is over a year old and the other is about 4 months old.  Both have been working like champs.  Simply can't live without these universal remotes.  As much as I like the design of the Harmony One, I can't justify the high price tag.  I could buy an iPad mini for that price.  This model requires 2xAA batteries but that's fine with me.  Save money plus I hear the rechargeable models are susceptible to decreased battery life over time.  AA batteries are cheap and easily replaceable.I have seen the resetting issue that most people are complaining about.  Seems to be caused by battery jostling that resets the remote when power is temporarily disconnected.  I fixed this by folding a strip of paper towel and stuffing it atop the batteries and against the door.  It ensures the batteries stay in place and don't jostle while the remote is in motion.  After doing this I stopped seeing the resets.  The 4 month old remote does not seem to have this problem, okay as is.
$review_summary.: Working great for over a year.  Fill battery compartment to prevent resetting issue.

Yes it is relatively compact, but I found the power zoom to be clunky.The Sony &#34;app store&#34; that lets you download applications is a disappointment.  They charge extra for features the camera should have built in (like bracketing), and it is very clunky to download those apps.Built in HDR setting not greatVideo shutter button is in awkward location for your right thumb.

Its a filter for your lens, youll get vignetting and noise around the edges of the photo. But for $9, its a great accessory and it definitely saved me money.

$REVIEW.: I am annoyed when a product comes without instructions so, right off the bat, we got off to a bad start. Installation isn't exactly 'plug and play' as you might expect in a product without instructions and I had never before installed hardware to the ipad. There is a slip of paper that tells you to go to a website (or scan a QR code) to get the manual. When I did so, I couldn't spot any product that began with "Hard shell" and the search function told me that there was no manual for such a product. I kept doing the same thing over and over and (finally!) it found the manual. For those of you who might be having the same problem, here is the link:[...]Once you know the process, installation (and 'pairing') is a breeze. The i-pad fits easily into the groove, the plastic stand that pops up holds it at the perfect angle for desk viewing at either orientation. It removes and slides in without effort.I am writing this review on the keyboard and I do like not having to use the tapping i-pad keyboard. I am always making mistakes, either adding extra letters or not having letters register. This is pretty close to typing with an actual keyboard. I love that I have arrow keys and a caps lock, I hate that the shift key on the right is a bit far and I wish it had a "delete" key so I could delete left to right instead of always right to left, but those are minor problems.  Of course, the keys are a little closer together than they would be on a regular keyboard, but you easily adjust to touch typing. Good responsive keys, neither requiring too much pressure nor overly sensitive. It also has tab, Fn, control, alt/option, and command/control.  Best of all, you don't have to keep switching between the letters keyboard and the number/symbols keyboard all the time.  Despite the fact that the i-pad weighs much more than the keyboard, the keyboard lays flat on the desk regardless of orientation. Since the non-slip buttons are only on the four corners, the smooth plastic surface slides off your lap and I don't feel comfortable using it that way, particularly in portrait orientation. I don't mind because I got it to work on a desk, but it might be a consideration for you. On the whole, the KEYBOARD part of the product rates pretty highly.My main complaint is that the I pad is hard to remove once you are no longer using the keyboard and want to use it as an i-pad cover, it is really awkward. It is difficult to snap on, and downright scary to snap off. I am concerned that I will damage the i-pad yanking so hard.  According to the online manual, there is supposed to be a "screen protector"included with the keyboard. I didn't get that (and I've carefully checked all the packing materials) but I doubt that this would make a difference in the easy of removal, and I'm wondering if, without it, the screen is vulnerable--maybe I'll insert a sheet of paper or something.Since I carry my i-pad in my purse I will continue to use the apple plastic cover as a cover. It is thin, doesn't take up as much room, and protects my i-pad well. I will  use the keyboard at home for writing e-mails (and reviews). I confess that this was always my intention, but it might have been nice to, occasionally, have the option of taking the keyboard along. After my struggles to get the i-pad to come apart from the keyboard cover, I have given up that idea.So, if this was only a 'keyboard' I would have given it a 5, but since it is also supposed to function as a 'cover' I've had to remove a couple of stars because it is not something I would ever choose to use as a cover.
$review_summary.: Pretty good (as a keyboard), but not as a cover.

$review_text.: I have an eight year old PC desktop in my office that I've upgraded as much as I could, and have been using as the centerpiece of my wireless network (while being physically connected into my cable modem)


 I've recently (finally!) bought a new desktop to replace it


 But while my old PC lacks the computing power to handle things like intense gaming and the like, it is still suitable for browsing the web and (to a lesser extent) streaming video

 So, I ordered this product, the "TP-LINK TL-WDN3200 Dual Band Wireless N600 USB Adapter, 2.4GHz 300Mbps/5Ghz 300Mbps, WPS Button, 802.1a/b/g/n, WEP, WPA/WPA2", so I could move my old PC out of my office and into the family room as an extra computer.The advantages of a dual band adapter is that things that come/go over the internet can be run in either the 2.4GHz band or the 5GHz band, the latter of which is less crowded and should provide a cleaner signal, which in turn means less lagging, less interference, and less of the dreaded spinning circle of buffering
 Note that you also need a dual band wireless router to take advantage of this, though.Set-up and installation was both quick and easy, even on my old warhorse

 I was able to get a good reception signal from anywhere in my house where I can get one with my laptops

 Heavy bandwidth applications seemed to run a bit slower for me than when the PC was connected to the cable modem, but is comparable to what I see on my laptops
 So I suspect that it's a function of not being able to transmit as much through the airways vice through the cable modem, not any problem with this device.Overall, this adaptor does what it says it will do, and won't cost you an arm or a leg
 Five stars.

$REVIEW.: The Pioneer BDP-51FD is one of the most well built Blu-ray players under $500 you will find in the market.  And, with its latest v1.17 firmware virtually all of the bugs have been squashed plus DVD upconversion is now superior even to high end chipsets like Silicon Optix Reon.  Pretty amazing what big strides this player has made in a short period of time.The Wolfsen DACs provide outstanding analog audio and the many A/V tweaks such as the Source Direct feature will keep tweakheads happy for a long time to come.While this player is not as user-friendly as some of the competition, once you've delved into all of its settings you will find that you can maximize A/V quality in a way not possible with other players.Highly recommended for the moderately experienced (or expert) home theater enthusiast!!  Nothing else in this pricerange comes close.

$REVIEW.: I've bought dozens of these Kingston flash drives over the years. Loved them. They were reliable, the flashing LED was bright enough to be seen through the plastic handle, and the folding clasp is a great idea.I just bought six more, of a couple of different sizes (16 GB and 32 GB), and at first I thought they must all be defective: none of them flashed to show that the drive was in use.I broke one open and they are completely different on the inside to the ones I've bought previously. Instead of a small circuit board with a tiny LED, there is nothing. The memory chip is now small enough to be almost entirely located in the plug itself: the handle of the drive is just empty space (hold it up to the light and you can see right through it).The memory chip is housed in a plastic clip that holds it in place in the plug. However, the plastic clip has a prominent hole right where an LED would need to go to be where the LED used to be in the old model, and, clearly visible in the hole, at the top end of the memory chip, are a couple of gold connection points. My two guesses are: 1) Toshiba (the chip manufacturer) intended an LED to be attached there; and 2) Kingstone just couldn't be bothered to do so.With these drives, then, you have *no idea* when your computer has finally emptied its buffer to the drive. You can no-longer just wait for the flashing to stop then remove it from the USB port; you have to keep trying to "safely eject" it until you are no-longer told the drive is in use.Well, that and when I have a row of flash drives in my USB hub, the flashing was the only way I could tell which was the one I was saving data to...If you use your flash drives for semi-permanent storage, I suppose the lack of a data transfer indicator may not be a deal breaker. For the rest of us, though, these things are no-longer top-of-the-line flash drives. They are just junk.
$review_summary.: Very disappointed - they no-longer flash to show data transfer

$review_text.: When it comes to giving 5 stars to any given product, you must think about people who are searching for the right prodcut and of course understanding what the real deal of the evaluation is

 First of all understand that this is oriented for the desktop (laptop or PC).Consider the following:1


 Have space for the subwoofer (usually under the desk is not enough) and if you dont have room for it CREATIVE offers a very compact 2.0 set that kicks very nice the bass.2


 The wired control..

is wired so you must understand you cannot control volume far from the source.Other than these two considerations, the sound quality and the power are just outstanding specially if you plan to use them in a small to medium size room


 And hey!  at this price?

$review_text.: This is a very stylish and attractive case. It provides the ipod with total protection from accidental bumps, scraps and droppings. The case itself is made a very durable hard plastic  which is encompassed by a rubberized trim to add an additional layer of security. The only reason I'm not giving it four stars is because the "double clasp" used to secure the case closed can be a little tricky to engage and the belt clip can be somewhat  troublesome to remove from your waist.All in all I recommend this case to anyone who owns an ipod classic this the case to own, it provides excellent access to the scroll wheel as well as the other ports!

$REVIEW.: I recieved my HDMI Cable promptly, and upon close examination of the product, find that it bears the "1.3" designation.A check of the CURRENT specs shows that the "1.3 Cable" is capable of handling everything EXCEPT "Updated list of CEC Commands".The 1.3 version will support Blu-Ray, Dolby Sound, and almost every concievable combination of HDTV and A-V components.HDMI Cable Versions 1.3(a), 1.3(b), or 1.3(c) are required for the "CEC Commands" mode. (Consult your HDTV's Owner's Manual for the "CEC Commands" info).The bargain-priced 1.3 version cable is PERFECT for my needs (Samsung 52LNA650 LCD HDTV-to-Blu-Ray).I will be buying a HDMI version 1.3b cable for the connection to my HDTV Cable Box to get the "CEC Commands" feature that's built into the Samsung --- from Amazon.com, of course !!!

$review_text.: We wanted a fairly simple receiver that had pass through.  You have to get into the setup menu and turn it on.  It works great!  The set up mike for the speakers is terrific.  Our speakers never sounded so balanced.  We're on cable and all the channels come in 5.1 surround sound except CBS, which isn't.  The only complaint I have is the receiver has only a direct internet connection on the back, so unless you have an HDMI connection on your computer to put into one of the HDMI connections on the back of the receiver you can't hook your computer directly to the receiver.  My HP computer didn't have an HDMI connection so I had an audio card installed with HDMI and plugged it into the dvd hdmi on the back of the receiver.  I'm using the blue ray connection for my discs. I have one HDMI left empty, our cable box is also using one,  The empty one is for games.  Which we don't have. When you turn the receiver off everything goes black for a second until the pass through kicks in then the tv comes back on using the television speakers.  The only other thing we would have liked would have been an AC plug on the receiver where we could have plugged our woofer into.

I ended up having to purchase an adapter to mount the speakers in the doors (bought the Scosche SAHC634 kit, which worked fine with some modifications - see my Amazon review for that item).

As for speed I am able to transfer episodes TiVo to TiVo as originally before - this thing can go up to 275Mbps which is faster than the usual ethernet @ 100MbpsPros:*Plug and play - Easy Set up* Set and forget - no need to reboot, reset, it just worksCons:*Requires a coax - would have been nice if you could choose a coax or ethernet port - (I know you can't use an ethernet port to substitute for a coax due to the bandwidth requirements of coax)All in a ll a great solution if you need an extra ethernet port 4/5 stars.

I do use it with one fairly large bag that I load up to carry on trips, and it does help a SLIGHT bit, but everything is relative.  A heavy bag is still a heavy bag.However, I thought I'd try using this pad with a guitar strap.  This works great for that purpose.  Even heavier guitars like Les Pauls seem lighter with this pad, even during longer playing sessions.  I'll probably buy a couple more for this purpose.

$review_text.: I spent a good deal of time looking at camera bags for my new Canon SX1-IS


 The problem of finding a small bag, protection, extra compartments and decent looks came together for this inexpensive bag
 My SX1 sits horizontaly, but can be pulled out of the tan coloured soft compartment easily,  There is a velcro spacer that I use for the remote control and lens cap


 Two side pouches work well for extra AA batteries the camera uses


 There are two meshed data card holders in the front pouch which has extra room for cleaning cloths
 The lid of the bag has a zippered/meshed area

 It comes with an adequate strap that snaps on to rings, so if you want to use your own strap, it's no problem
 Not enough space for an additional flash, instruction book or filter sets, but if you want a small, protective and inexpensive bag for a basic Canon SX1-IS or SX10-IS


 This one works.

$REVIEW.: I bought this unit because I wanted a small TV in a room where I had no connection to my Dish-TV receiver. Rather than trying to run cable to the room, this seemed like an interesting alternative.I was a little concerned about quality, but the unit broadcasts over 802.11g, and I thought that should be plenty of bandwidth.However, the quality of the image I get looks like something you would download from the internet. From a long distance, it looks good, but from up close there are tons of compression artifacts and faces are hardly recognizable. If this is what it looks like directly over wireless-G, I can't imagine what it would like like if I tried to look at it across the WAN.You probably wouldn't notice the poor picture on the small screen on a PSP, so I would guess it would work well for that. However, don't by this product expecting to get a decent picture on a computer monitor.

$REVIEW.: I've had these for over a year now and it's worth the $16 I paid at that time. It seems like now you can get the in-line with microphone version for the same price. These are bass heavy earbuds and while great with lots of genres, obviously not so good with all types of music. I don't use them daily but I've used them at least once a week for over a year, so these are definitely reliable. The extra buds are handy since one of them is kind of loose now, so I jut replaced it with another one (mine came with 3 extra pairs).Comfort wise these are not the best and I've tested all sizes and even couple of other buds from a different brand. If you listen to music for hours then I found this a bit painful after continuous use. If you listen to lots of music for long periods then get another one. It definitely blocks outside noise and provides good listening experience. This is part of the reason why these are bass heavy. You can use a smaller tip to reduce the bass, but it'll reduce the notice filtering as well as fit wont be perfect. Overall for my use I find this a worthy product and would recommend considering the price now.
$SUMMARY.: Good in-ear phones, could be more comfortable.

$REVIEW.: This SanDisk Extreme III SD worked great in my camera (Lumix DMC-LC1).  It was fast and allowed a quicker sequence of shots.  Downloading into the PC was quicker.  Then the camera started reporting security blocks and I would have to re-insert the SD to get it to work.  I thought the problem might be the camera, but eventually the SD security switch disappeared, and may still be inside the camera.  At that point no further access to the disk was possible.  I ordered another one and am being very careful to insert it gingerly.  Maybe I won't have the same problem.  Maybe any SD could fail in this way.  Other disks have worked fine in the camera.  I guess I will find out whether this one has a unique switch issue in time.  The potential buyer is cautioned to check other reviews for this kind of problem.

$REVIEW.: Everyone who's wired a stereo has tried to get all the strands of wire from the speaker wire down into that tiny hole on the binding post then screw down the nut on it.  Oh yea - without shorting one single strand to the adjoining nut!  Well take a look at the nut and you'll likely find it has about a 3/16" hole in it give or take.  You'll also see all the nuts (red/black) are a special distance apart.  Those holes and those distances are not an accident, many speakers have the same setup.The wire won't go into any hole on its own, but these connectors make the job easy.  outside of the dark dusty back of your stereo you can wire these on the end of the speaker wire where it's bright and clean.  Then you reach behind the stereo and push the whole assembly into the holes on those nuts to make the connection.  Prepare the other end as well and you are set to go.The quality is great - gold plating, test and measurement equipment grade parts, nothing wrong there.  Really there is nothing wrong anywhere, so that's why the 5 star rating.

But I never could completely eliminate the hum, so I finally said to myself, stop trying to save a couple of dollars, and order a cable that will be HIGHLY SHIELDED. So I seached Amazon, and found this one, with all good revues, and bought it. Received it, installed it, NEVER ever had another hum or any other problem.

$review_text.: This Tokina lens takes very sharp pictures. The maximum aperture of 2.8 is not bad for indoor shooting, but not spectacular. For low-light shooting you will need faster glass. This lens makes a fine walk-around lens for a crop-sensor DSLR.The bonus macro feature is useful, but requires getting so close to the subject that lighting can be a problem.I had to return this lens after less than a week because the focus mechanism failed. The manual focusing bound up. It appeared that the gears inside simply didn't line up properly.  The push-pull clutch system used to switch from manual to auto focus seemed a bit kludgy even before it failed, for what that's worth.I am not taking a chance on exchanging it. I chose to spend the extra money to replace it with the Sigma 30mm f1.4. While Sigma is known to have issues with focusing accuracy, I am not aware that their lenses are prone to outright mechanical failure. (The Sigma is also two stops faster - but no macro feature.)

$review_text.: To keep it brief, the five star reviews here are spot on in regards to the color

Pop in any Pixar movie on Bluray: Absolutely gorgeous.However, the monitor I bought came with a stuck green pixel near the center and many specs of dust behind the glass near the top

Returned it for a replacement
Received the replacement and right out of the box I immediately spotted 6 dead pixels in the center

Returned this one for a refund.I am very disappointed, but I will try again in the future and update this review.

$review_text.: I installed my WRT610N router a little over a month ago as a replacement for an old wired router and a WAP54G wireless access point.  Let me start by saying that, frankly, I don't understand the bad reviews on this router as my experiences have been nothing but positive.  The router that I received was downlevel on the firmware, so my first step was to bring the firmware current and that was performed with no problem.  Since I am familiar with Linksys products, I did not use the LELA software for installation but rather opted for the web interface.  In a matter of 30 minutes, I had fully configured the router, setup the WPA2 security, and installed an external disk to the router's USB port.  In my installation I have wired as well as 2.4GHZ and 5.0GHZ wireless devices and after entering the encryption key into the wireless devices, all attached to the router with no problem.  My 5.0GHZ adapter is attached to my DirecTv receiver two rooms away from the router and consistantly shows a 50% signal strength.  While this could be a little better, I have not had a single connection drop and the data rate is very good.I wanted to wait until it had been installed for a little while before I commented to see if any unusual problems occured, but so far nothing.  Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and I have no problem recommending this router to anyone that is looking to upgrade to wireless N.

That's until I saw this one - respected brand, good reviews & I thought I'd give it a shot.This is a well built handsome unit. Not very large, but pack an impressive performance for its size.  Definitely makes a big difference when watching movies ... the bass makes the sound (& the movie) come alive!I connected this unit to a 'Switched' AC outlet on my home theater system, so it turns ON only when I'm watching TV.Great Buy at this price.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this to upgrade the sound on my galaxy S3.  So far I like it a lot.  It puts out pretty good sound for the size and I have yet to recharge the battery since the first time I charged it.  It is a much improvement over the stock sound on my phone and would probably even help my netbook out as well.  For the price I don't think you can go wrong.  It really feels and seems high quality.  It closes down into a small ball and comes with a carrying case.  Don't expect the speaker to blow out your neighbors windows, but it is nice for phones and other small electronics that don't have great stock speakers.

$REVIEW.: I must admit I got these headphones because they came in pretty colors. I chose the yellow because it's a cheerful color.I have at least five sets of earphones and didn't expect these to be any better than any of the others. I quickly learned that these are much more than "pretty." The adverts say it's the "acoustically tuned driver units" that elevates music enjoyment. I don't know about that, but I do know my music does sound much better.In addition to crisp, clear, quality music, I also like the way the tiny cables wrap into the large yellow cap for easy storage. A bit of a nuisance when wrapping, but well worth it; actually, takes less than a minute.Highly recommended.Reviewed by Betty Dravis, April 14, 2013

$review_text.: I know, my title has a lot of adjectives. But I am pleasantly surprised at the quality and sound from these headphones. Sometimes when there is a gimmick to something, there can be a lesser quality somewhere else. But I am very happy with the sound that comes from these. They are heavy on bass but vocals are very clear and evenly balanced with the music.The buds are very comfortable and stay in my ears easily. I've had other in-ear buds that I have to keep repositioning and they always seem on the verge of falling out. These are solidly placed but very comfortable, offering great noise cancellation as well.The zipper is clever and even though it is solid and keeps the headphones in a secure position, it does add some bulk and weight. It is a little stiff too but maybe that will soften over time. The rest of the cable is soft and reinforced fabric weave. Unlike other wires covered in plastic, these don't carry sound to the earpieces when you touch them. That's a pet peeve of mine! All the connections are solid and look like they'll stand up to lots of use.Works great with my iPod with a variety of music styles.I received a free set of Zipbuds for evaluation and review.

$REVIEW.: Considering the price, I have only one beef with this recorder: It is a ROYAL PAIN to erase files you have no further use for

I use it to record college lectures several days a week


It's great for that because you can date your notes on paper and then just look up the file for that date on the recorder when you want to hear the lecture again
No problems there, and great for final exam review.The problem manifests when the semester's over and you want or need to clear data from the recorder to get ready for the next semester

I've checked the manual and the manufacturer's FAQ page, and there is no way to erase the entire memory at once


You can only erase file by file by file, one at a time, or erase all files for a particular date
That's DATE, not dateS


If you've recorded several classes, several days a week, over an entire semester, that's a lot of dang files!Not only that, but the number of steps you have to take to erase just one file or one day's files is ridiculous -- a minimum of five button pushes distributed over three different buttons, and believe me when I say it's not at all an intuitive process


Only one of the buttons says &#34;erase;&#34; the other two buttons used are the play/OK button and the rewind button


Yes, the rewind button! Makes no sense at all to me
Maybe this is some failsafe to keep people from inadvertently erasing files, but I find it ridiculously tedious


An option to erase all files on the device should be provided

Even if the erase-all function required five button pushes, it would be a heck of a lot better than the one-by-one deletion system as it is right now.Otherwise, I'm very happy with this recorder
I'm on my fifth college semester with it, and it's still going strong.

$REVIEW.: The Case Star crystal case fits very well, it actually took a little more time than other cases to install because the hard plastic material isn't as flexible as the &#34;rubberized&#34; type cases I've had before. Likewise the thin profile doesn't make my laptop look bulky like the silicone cases available. The material is semi-transparent, so when I open my laptop lid you can easily see the lighted Apple logo through the top cover. The soft rubber feet keep the laptop from sliding around on smooth surfaces, and best of all the $10 price - with some Macbook Air 11 cases coming in at $30 or more, this is an excellent buy.

$review_text.: JBL is a respected name in professional audio equipment and you can often see them in concert venues and movie theaters


JBL named this product the "Balboa", no doubt to capitalize on the connotation of punching power associated with Slyvester Stallone's icon boxing character Rocky.At 30+ pounds, this unit is no lightweight
It's very BIG and very heavy, but in a good way

It's bigger than the two other subwoofers I own
The construction feels very sturdy and it can function as a coffee table


I often stack books, DVD's, and other items on top of it for convenience due to my room's limited space, or even use it as a footstool


Its attractive wood housing fits in with almost any decor.Performance-wise, I have no complaints whatsoever
I am by no means an audiophile
My main use for a subwoofer is to enjoy movies and video games, so I do not have a discerning ear when it comes to LFE speakers


Boom boom, it shakes the room and I'm happy

The low price also makes it a very economical choice as an entry-level subwoofer for those who are ready to rumble.

These speakers peak at 120watts from low to highest they sound excellent. Highs, mid and low ranges are excellent. I don't need huge speakers anymore the 70's are gone and now it's 2012 these do a great job. When paired to matching SONY Center Speaker really sounded nice. I also have older Radio Shack Optimums 160watt Fluid Center and Jensen 240watt 12" Downward-Fire Active with Crossover Sub-woofer paired with 6x of the SONY SS-B1000 connected to SONY STR-DH520 7.1 System in my Living Room. In the Master Bed Room Sony SS-CN5000 150watt Dual Center Channel Speaker and Yamaha Active 8" Front-Fire 100watt with Advanced Yamaha Active Servo Technology (YST) 4x of SONY SS-B1000 connected to SONY STR-DH520 7.1 System.Note these are not self hanging speakers even if you use 2x right angle brackets the weight of the speakers on drywall would be too much unless you can find the joint beam use heavy weight brackets.

Or just place them on the floor.Speaker wired used:RCA AH16100SN 3x 100 Ft. 16-Gauge Speaker Wire (purchased on Amazon)How many SB SS-B1000 speakers do need if you have 7.1 or 5.1 Component Surround System?7.1 F/SR/SF with SONY SS-B1000: 6xSold in Pairs: 3x Boxes5.1 F/SR with SONY SS-B1000: 4xSold in Pairs: 2x Boxes

$review_text.: Cisco gave out this backpack's predecessor for Networkers 2006, and I have been using it as my main laptop carrier ever since. Almost nothing has gone wrong with it in over seven years of almost daily usage. I say almost nothing because both zipper pull tabs for the main compartment have recently broken. The zippers themselves are fine; it is just the tab on the zipper head that you grab which has broken.I am going to order some zipper pulls for my older Mobile Edge backpack for the time being. However, I did spend a couple minutes researching that backpack in order to find that it was manufactured by Mobile Edge. I can guaranteed that I will be ordering this backpack if I ever get to a point where I want to replace my current one.This will easily carry any of the 17 - 18" widescreen laptops. And the pack has plenty of room for other gear. It is large enough, in fact, that I have used it as my only piece of luggage for a two-day work trip--complete with extra shoes, change of clothes, a light jacket, hygiene gear, my laptop, AC adapter, mouse, extra network cables, etc.The only time that I would not recommend this backpack is for those that are minimalists. If you only carry around a moleskin notebook, a pen, and your laptop in a messenger bag, this backpack is not for you. For just about anyone else, you cannot go wrong with the durability, quality, and carrying capacity of this backpack.
$SUMMARY.: The absolute best backpack...

The included stylus / pen combination is also excellent for those who enjoy programs like sketchbook pro as it has a nice little slot for storing the pen.Another nice feature of the case is the magnet that suspends the tablet when it is shut.

$REVIEW.: This product broke as soon as I tried to assemble everything.I'm quite experienced with computer hardware and this was, by far, the easiest product to break.The plastic pieces were glued on with hot glue, which didn't hold well at allLuckily I didn't break the "motherboard" piece so the product still "works", but I had to duct tape the ends back (because all the clips broke off) in order for it to still be an "enclosure".Pros:Still workscomes with a small screwdrivercomes with a protective sleevecheapCons:very fragilepoorly built, poor craftsmanshippoor packaging (a plastic bag)no instructions (not really needed)weak plastic partsALMOST DOA'edOther: It requires TWO USB ports, but It looks like many of them that don't use an electrical outlet do as well.Bottom Line: WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.

$REVIEW.: Wow, what can I say.  This product just works as advertised, and what is advertised is nothing short of amazing.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  IR to RF and back to IR is nothing earthshaking.  But for something so reasonably priced to work so well and so neatly and deliver everything it promised is... refreshing!I have a TV in every room but thanks to Comcast's pricing setup, I only have two cable box.  So despite paying for digital (anything over channel 77) and premium channels, I only got the extra channels on TVs that had the cable box.  Not anymore!  Thanks to this product, I have access to digital and premiums on every room.  All I had to do was run the coax out from the cable box to my video splitter in the utility room, and from there, to each TV in the house.  All I have to remember is to take my remote with me, which is easy since the cable box in the basement is controlled by my universal anyway.I understand that this may not work for everyone if more than one person wants to watch different programs.  But I have basic cable connected to each TV and the other main TV has the other cable box (DVR) connected to it.  For now, it's just me and my wife in the house so we have not run across any conflict.One tiny smidgen of negative is the IR cable blaster doesn't seem to work well.  I had to position it several times over the IR receptor to make it work.  But I'm ready to blame the cable box for that since everything else on this product works so well.Get it.  This is a great product.
$SUMMARY.: Easy and just works!

It can not only sit on a desk, it can also be attached to a vertical surface.  They also include three plastic cord clips that are magnetic in case a cord isn't. I'm using one of them just because I didn't like the angle of the cord without it.  I'm also using it to hold one of my Bluetooth ear pieces.

Great for video recording, super sharp, stills equally sharp (you have to use a tripod to get the best video and stills). you can use hand held at 75mm, but tripod beyond that. Color and contrast was good. This is one lens that everyone should have, especially for the price, I could have paid $300.00 for this and would still be happy. This is a keeper.

$review_text.: I wanted to get a "more than just a point and shoot" camera to capture the precious moments of my first baby. Husband and I are not photographers and have never used anything other than a point and shoot cameras (various Canons Elphs and Casio Exlims) so we found the huge SLRs really intimidating and couldn't imagine carrying them around with ease. Then someone recommended the Panasonic GF1, a small DSLR, but told us that the GF2 was available and that we should probably get the newer model. So we did. Results were horrible. Photos were always slightly blurry. The camera gobbles up battery charge when not even in use. So it was never readily handy when we needed to take a picture. What a waste of $400 this was!PHOTOS ARE ALWAYS SLIGHTLY BLURRY--Since we need to capture baby moments that go by in an instant, the camera is always auto mode. But just about every shot is blurry, no matter indoor, outdoor, day, night, etc. We tried to manually adjust the setting but, the results are hit and miss and still usually blurry. The only time we used with any real success was when mounted to tripod and we were taking our own Christmas portraits at home. That took like 20 minutes of us getting the lighting right and trying picture after picture after picture. Not really an impromptu setting like what we really need a camera for.ALWAYS OUT OF BATTERIES--One thing that really infuriates me about this camera is the horrible battery life. This camera is literally ALWYAS out of batteries. I've never had a camera that drains the batteries like this one. I'm certain that it's the camera not the batteries. When we fully charge the batteries and put them in the camera and leave the camera on the kitchen table for 2 days, it's out of batteries again without even using it once. So almost every time we've reached for this camera when a precious moment comes up suddenly, it's out of batteries!!! And my husband and I are scrambling for our smart phones instead.We really tried to use and love the camera and have read the owner's manual. My baby is 8 months now, so we've been trying to use this camera for almost a year. Most of the pictures we have of our baby is actually taken by our Samsung Note 3 and Galaxy S4. Not great either so this camera really let us down. It's not like we're going to get those 8 months of her life back. I think we tried for so long because like I said, we are not pros, and thought that the bad pictures were our fault.Recently we went to dinner with a friend who has a Canon EOS Rebel (don't remember the exact model). We tried it out without knowing what we were doing. It took gorgeous photos with ZERO effort. We are definitely getting rid of this and getting a real SLR. Again, what a waste of $400.You've been warned. Do not buy this. But if you really want to, you can buy mine. I'll give you a discount :)

$review_text.: I bought this kit to upgrade the RAM in my Acer Aspire One 721-3574 netbook, based on a post on a netbook upgrade site.  Even though Acer says my netbook model can only take 4GB of RAM (2 x 2GB), the guy said my model could actually take twice that much RAM -- and he was right.  My netbook recognizes 7.75GB under Windows 7 (64-bit), and the increase in performance is great!  My netbook uses a little more power with this much of an increase in RAM (I started with a single 2GB stick), but the performance boost is definitely worth the small power usage penalty.  And with Crucial, you never have to worry about quality or reliability.

$REVIEW.: I really wanted to like these.  I love the weight to them, the sturdy looking/feeling construction, and especially the lifetime warranty.  I wanted headphones to grow old with, and these appeared to be them.  ..but then I listened to them.I'll begin by saying I'm using a small portable CD player (and IPOD Classic), along with a small amp (the amazing Fiio E3 - amazing results for its cheap price.  I don't think I can mention a dollar amount in a review, but lets just say a person working minimum wage in America can afford that amp after two hours worth of work). An amp is a necessity for this set, and without it you'll get low volume levels when using them with portable devices.  Trust me, it's no fun to discover your nice new expensive pair of headphones refuses to be audible despite how loud you turn your portable CD player up.  These headphones aren't intended to be used with low (power) output devices, so be sure to give it the juice it needs..use an amp.Anyway I listen to classical music primarily, as well as your Apoptygma Berzerks, Lacrimosas, and Anathemas of the world.  But that's irrelevant, because no matter what I played, these headphones were consistently beat out by others within its price range (sound wise, not construction/warranty wise).  I remember reading from a reviewer that complained these really don't have a sound stage - and he's completely right.  There's left, center, and right.  When another comparably priced set of headphones presents better clarity and space between the instruments within that "left/center/right" field of sound...what else are you suppose to think about a pair that doesn't?Out of what I tried (and ultimately returned from a store with a liberal return policy - Sennheiser HD280PRO, HD238, HD428, Bose Triports, Koss Pro4AAT), my favorite would be the HD280PRO, and would be what I recommend a person atleast looking into as an alternative to these.  The Bose set also performed well, and has a distinctly different sound than the HD280PRO.  Both are head and shoulders better than this Koss pair, except in warranty/construction of course.In the end (and after probably being banned from the store), I was truly amazed at how much headphones affect the sound quality of music (especially with classical music), and I figured - since I'm already considering spending ..fourteen minimum wage hours on a pair of headphones, I might as well save up and buy something stratospherically superior to everything I tried out.  Why commit to an inferior product when something (you intend to ultimately buy) is only a few weeks away?  So I doubled my budget and bought the heavenly AKG K701.  It's definitely not fair to compare the Koss set to this, but to the willing classical music lover, if at all possible to save up a little longer and work a few extra shifts, I really think you'll be amazed at the difference, just as I was.  You're being robbed of so much within your music if this Koss set is what you use to listen to your music through.  You deserve better (or maybe not, I don't know you).And BTW, that Fiio E3 amp drives the AKG K701 set pretty well, too.Fiio E3 Headphone AmplifierSennheiser HD 280 - Headphones ( ear-cup ) - blackBOSE(R) Triport Headphone - SilverAKG K 701 WHITE HEADPHONES

$review_text.: I bought this case specifically for an htpc.  It fits great with a core i5 650 with a good amount of space surrounding the cpu.  The wires were a stored out of the way with a few wire ties.  Very compact little case.  There is also enough room for a 2u video card on the side of the mb/case.  I am currently using onboard video so this space is vacant for now.The lights on the front were a little bright so I pulled the hd light cable off the mb so that I don't have to watch it flash.  The light on the front is bright as well and I plan on putting something over it to cover it.Over all this was exactly what I thought it would be.  Little larger than most devices, not as pretty as a ps3, wii, or an xbox 360 but highly functional.  I'll try to post pictures when I get a chance.

It stinks because there are so many real cheap BG's for all my Canon SLR's but sadly they are VERY hit or miss, usually miss.  I wish this wasn't the case because they're much cheaper but I suppose that's the issue right there.  Regardless, spend the extra money and have a grip that works great and will last as long as your frame.This will not work with the 7D, not sure why that's a "Tag" option but disregard it if you see in other's reviews.

$REVIEW.: Looking for a small, rather inexpensive camera system to basically monitor the outside of my property at night I settled on this system.  Only a few reviews here about it but it seemed to have all the features I was looking for which were for the most part a wireless system with night vision, and motion censor recording.  I must say up until discovering this system's major flaw I was quite happy.  Picture quality is very good, night vision quality is pretty much on par with lighted picture quality I really noticed no degradation.  Audio quality is pretty good, and the wireless connection was very stable as well, I set a camera up at one end of the house and one in the garage, then went to the other end of the house and upstairs and had no trouble connecting to both cameras.Now the deal breaker, and I think it might be a deal breaker for a lot of people.  The motion sensor capability is quite unless if you plan on using 2 or more cameras.  In setting up a recording schedule with the provided software you are only allowed to use set one camera on motion sensor at a time for every given 2 hour period.  Meaning unless your sitting in front of the screen manually switching through the cameras, the only camera you're going to get anything out of is the one that is scheduled to record at that time, and if you set the system to motion sensor only that one camera selected for that 2 hr time slot will be enabled with motion sensor, all the other cameras are as good as off and are basically useless (unless your sitting at your computer all night switching between cameras!).  This really baffles me why Uniden didn't incorporate motion sensor capability to be enabled on all cameras at the same time, and automatically switch and record when motion is detected on any of the cameras, other systems of this same type and price range seem to have it.  So if you have four cameras running on this system and it's set to motion sensor, you're going to have a 25% chance of recording any motion going on outside your house, that's not acceptable to me, and I don't consider that surveillance! So I'm sending this back and checking out the Lorex LW2702 which Costco sells for about $50 more, it includes automatic motion sensor switching between cameras and quite a few other bonuses.

When attached, the camera feels secure, and is easy to maneuver for fast shots.  My only complaint is that it takes up a lot of room under the camera.  With my ball head quick release base and the strap attachment point, my camera is about 1" taller and 1 pound heavier.

$review_text.: This Pentax flash offers all stuff you'd expect from a basic AF flash (power zoom, bounce, AF illuminator), plus a bit more.Like most of the camera companies, Pentax offers a basic and more advanced (or powerful) flash.  As basic flashes go, this one only lacks "swivel" (side-to-side adjustment) from ranking 5-stars.  In terms of exposure accuracy, this flash ranks equal to the best.Useful features included that aren't typically found in cheaper flashes are:1) Built-in wide angle diffuser.  Need a bit more width in the coverage?  A pull out panel is located in the top of the flash;2) Built-in "catch light".  This small, white card is in the same space as the diffuser.  If using bounce, this will help elimate shadows caused by the bounce, and puts a little gleam in the eye;3) High-Flash synch.  Most useful for outdoor portrait photography, this allows you to set the shutter speed to faster than normal, allowing you to control the depth-of-field;4) "Spot Beam" function.  In low light situations, the AF illuminator in the flash fires to help the AF system of the camera.  The SB features allows the illuminator to work even when the flash is not used for exposure (such as in a museum);5) Command functions.  Unlike the Nikon SB-600 or Canon 430EX, this flash can be used to control and trigger multi-flash operations.A very good basic flash, only a swivel away from 5-star perfection!

$REVIEW.: I used this with an i5-3570k on a ASUS P8Z77-V LX motherboard.Pros:Does a great job of keeping my cpu cool (with other push pull fans).You can mount a second fan on the other side of the heat sink to increase air flow.Cons:The plastic attachments are difficult to work with. The heat sink is pretty tall and barely fits in my mid ATX tower. Be sure to note the air flow direction of the fan before mounting everything. The fan protrudes far enough that it comes close to overlapping the ram slots (This depends on your motherboard).(-1 star for the attachments)If you are planning to run permanent overclock, I propose you consider liquid cooling. Else, this does an amazing job.

$REVIEW.: What else can I say about this lens that everyone else has already said?This lens creates incredible pictures, especially in low light. The shallow depth of field and beautiful f/1.8 creates a pleasing blur.I've uploaded a couple pictures to show the amazing depth of field this creates.I have no experience with the 50mm f/1.8D, since I chose this lens over that, but simply look at the other reviews.I personally believe this lens to be well worth the extra money.It makes a wonderful portrait lens with the tight view of field using a D90, and if you want something wider you can use the 35mm f/1.8 DX lens.

$review_text.: PROS:SmallLightAttractiveFast, native USB 3.0 speedsHigh capacityWorks out of the box with Time Machine for backupsCONS:Need to download HFS+ drivers from the web to use on a Windows deviceNo options for connectivity besides USB (unlike previous editions of the Backup Plus drives, that could be converted to thunderbolt drives after buying an accessory)Bundled software (with the exception of HFS+ driver) does not add too much valueQUICK OVERVIEWThe Seagate Backup Plus Slim 1TB Portable External Hard Drive for Mac is a great option for external and portable storage.  There is a lot of hard drive packed into a small package.  It is a simple and easy to use, portable, storage solution.WHAT'S IN THE BOXIn the box, you will find the drive itself, a USB 3.0 cable (compatible with USB 2.0), and a quick start guide.The first thing you'll notice out of the box is that this drive is even smaller, lighter, and thinner than the previous generation Seagate Backup Plus Drive. The device is well machined with crisp edges and the aluminumized top and black bottom are meant to complement teh colors of the latest iMacs. There is a single, broad LED on the right lower corner of the device that indicates that the power is on and flickers when the device is in use.WORKS WITH MAC AND CAN WORK WITH WINDOWS AS WELLTypical for Seagate, there is software preloaded.  The Seagate Dashboard software .dmg file (for OS X) and .exe file (for Windows) are there for installation. The device is plug-and-play on OS X and is immediately recognized.  In order to run the device on Windows, you will have to go to the Seagate support site and download the HFS+ driver so that Windows can access Mac formatted drive.  This allows Windows to read the Mac OS Extended (Journaled) formatting. (Of course, you could always reformat the drive to FAT or NTFS for native Windows compatibility, but this drive is being sold as a Mac drive.)One thing that Seagate could have done is made a small FAT partition on the drive that contained the HFS+ software.  It would have eaten away at a small amount of drive space, but would have made searching for the HFS+ drivers unnecessary.  Even though the device is primarily meant for Mac users, it is also meant to be portable and usable on other computers.TRANSFER SPEEDSTransfer speeds were appropriately fast on a computer with a USB 3.0 connection.  My Mac only has USB 2.0 ports, but my work PC has USB 3.0 and the transfers seemed plenty fast.  With USB 3.0 speeds, you might not think that there is a need for any other kind of connectivity.  Rightly or wrongly, Apple was too busy pushing Thunderbolt and Firewire and I don't believe that they put a USB 3.0 port in an iMac until late in 2012.  There are many Macs out there still relatively new and still in use that don't have USB 3.0.PREDICTED RELIABILITYI have used Seagate portable drives for a while. Seagate appears to have high production standards and I have not had problems with reliability of any of my Seagate portable drives after years of use.  I can't vouch for the longevity of this specific drive, but on the basis of my past experience with Seagate the predicted reliability should be good.BUNDLED SOFTWARESeagate bundles its Dashboard software with the drive. This software is not necessary to run the drive and for me was a bust and didn't add much value.The dashboard software was basically a way to quickly register the device with Seagate and gives a conduit to connect the drive to the web.  The dmg icon on the drive is actually just a link to download the latest Dashboard software. You then walk through registration and then the Dashboard is installed.For some reason, you have to reboot the computer after installing the software.  Call me spoiled, but any software that makes me reboot my Mac after installing just really tics me off.  I wouldn't have thought anything of this as a PC user, but Mac users rarely have to reboot.The options on the Dashboard are underwhelming, at best.  It shows an icon of your drive and tells you if its registered.  It can act as a conduit to upload and download to Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube--although you certainly don't need this software to do that. If you download the Seagate mobile app to your tablet or smartphone, apparently you can automatically load pictures and video via the web to the drive. For some, this might make sense.  For my part, though, I use iCloud for backup anyway and synch my iPhone with my iMac regularly.  I really don't have any specific need for yet another way to back up my portable device.Beyond that, the Dashboard keeps a log of activity and also can check for updates of itself.  It also has links to Seagate customer support and a link to the drive's user manual.CONCLUSIONAll in all, this is a convenient, highly portable, and easy to use Mac formatted drive. Recommended.

$review_text.: At last, Palm gets it right -- A high quality, low price PDA with all the features you need, and none you don't

This is quite simply, a beautiful piece of engineering, and whether you are new to PDAs or upgrading, you will not be disappointed...For a bargain price of 200 smackers, Palm provides the following key features:1) A top-notch, large, hi-res screen (check it out in a store first)

Many previous Palms have skimped on the screen -- a big no-no in my book
I'd much rather have a slower processor than an unreadable (m505) or too-small screen (Zire, m100)


Pointing and clicking on a Palm is hard enough without having a small, dark screen to boot.2) Generous 32 MB Ram


Finally, Palm stops skimping on this important area! It's not enough to make you ditch your iPod, but you can play a few tunes, look at a few pictures, transfer some files

This is a big improvement from the bad-old 8 MB days, which is Okay for contacts but worthless for anything else.3) Rechargeable lithium polymer
Top notch

No skimping, no muss, no fuss.4) Great design
Clean, simple, portable, shirt-pocketable

No keyboard, but I've never been a thumbpad fan.5) MS Office functions included -- Word, Outlook, Powerpoint
Why you would use them, however, is a bit bizarre to me


Who wants to spend the time coding in a Powerpoint presentation with a stylus? Yet, if this is important to you, it's here


And having your email with you can be a plus...As for what you won't get: There is no phone, no camera, no thumbpad, no Bluetooth, no WiFi


This is close to a pure PDA, though it can display pictures and double as a poor-man's MP3 player

That's what I was looking for.Here's a basic product guide:New Palm Zire -- Bargain basement model with 7.2 MB of Ram, upgraded from hobbled 2 MB original model

About 100 smackers
Often offered free as bundle deals with new computers
Good starter model for the price

Includes rechargeable battery
Memory can not be upgraded
Horribly skimpy black-on-grey screen.Tungsten T2, etc.: Deluxe models that feature, in some cases, larger screens/Bluetooth wireless connectivity/thumbpads with dropdown graffiti screens

All unnecessary features in my book, especially given their much higher prices.Clie models (SJ30, etc.) recently have owned the mid-range of the Palm product line, providing color screens, style and multimedia features for less than Palm
But no longer


The Clie models simply can not compete with this new Palm -- they feel and look clunky in comparison and generally feature smaller, dimmer screens


And the upper-echelon Clie models get very expensive.Sony models also have a reputation for less-stellar customer service
(I've had excellent service from Palm.)The Treo models from Handspring/Palm should be considered if you are a thumbpad fan, or if you want your PDA to also be your phone

But let's face it, how many people can afford spending four hundred smackers on a PDA?BTW, when comparing, I've found you can generally ignore the speed of the processor

For most Palm functions, the reaction time is near instantaneous, or at most a second or two lag.As for PocketPCs, some of them are now very attractively priced and are worth checking out


I've yet to use one extensively, so I'll stick to what I know -- Palms are simple, easy to use and almost guaranteed to improve your productivity

It's like having a backup for your brain


And who doesn't need that?Enjoy!

$REVIEW.: I am not a camera expert at all.  I wanted to take a digital SLR class, and to do so, I needed to buy a digital SLR.  I was looking at the Canons in the $650 price range.I mentioned this to a friend of mine who is a professional photographer.  She said that if I had any willingness at all to spend more, I should get the Nikon D90 - that it stood alone in class - it was the only pro-quality camera that was priced as though it were not a pro camera.This is what she said "This camera is sick and does video too. You may have seen the ads for it on TV. It has these brand new Nikon sensors which are incredible at shooting at all light levels. A lot of people are saying it's technically almost the same as my five thousand dollar camera. It's the kind of camera which is making pros scared that people will not hire pros any more."A professional photographer I trust endorsing it to this level, basically telling me that it was my only option - that was enough for me.  More than my analyzing a chart of what features it has and what it doesn't - things I don't understand yet.  So I bought the camera and brought it to work, and a coworker's husband is a professional photographer and he said that the Nikon D90 was his backup camera and he can't tell the difference.  So that makes two pros who unequivocally say it stands alone in its class.So I'm not a pro, and what I can say is that it was very easy to learn, the video quality is also actually quite good, I've been taking pictures that look great, and the battery lasts forever.  Also, any of my friends who know I have a camera drool when they find out I have the Nikon D90.The short answer is this - either trust me that I've had two pros tell me what I've told you, or find a professional photographer and ask them about the Nikon D90.  I'm positive that they will tell you that there's nothing comparable unless you want to spend 5 times as much.Sometimes you just want the expert to point and say - that one, that's the right choice - your only choice.  Sometimes you don't want to analyze tables of features and try to make heads and tails of it.

$review_text.: I am very happy with this product. I've loaded it with up to 45 pounds of camera gear (500mm, 200-400mm, large body, and numerous other lens, laptop, etc), and it does hold a lot of gear. It gets uncomfortable although still supports the gear fine over about 30-35 pounds worth of gear, but quite comfortable with loads below 25 pounds. The tripod straps and pocket work well although I wish the tripod foot pocket came out more when open and the straps were sewn in so the buckles didn't slide out of reach and also not so long. The side attachment points are handy if you use Tamrac's accessories, but not really needed other than a water bottle holder, as the back pockets for cards, batteries, etc are pretty handy although one does have to worry about a card slipping out if you have the pocket open when opening the main compartment. I did loose a battery this way. I wish the pack opened from the inside (against back) instead of outside/back of the pack so it was more secure from prying hands and also so the back pad and straps didn't have to get laid onto the dirt every time its opened, as you lay it down on them and then the dirt transfers from the back pad to you shirt. I also wish the laptop pouch was between the back and camera gear instead of on the outside which adds weight to the top and gets banged every time its opened. Also a built in water bottle holder or attachment point, also pockets on the straps for phone, battery and memory cards would be a nice touch. The main compartment does have velcro everywhere to adjust the pads where you need them, and there are just the right number of pads. Overall, this pack is very well made, well designed, of high quality materials and has good padding that is easily adjusted to match your equipment. Some minor refinements would make this pack even better.

Now, instead of sometimes filling the internal drive of the DVR, I haven't seen the used capacity go over 5%! I'm not sure why the drive seems to be active (flashing activity light and head noises) even when the DVR is off and not recording a show, but that is probably determined by the DVR doing something in the background rather than any issue with the drive.

$review_text.: I bought this to function as a music server and backup server for a primary laptop and a couple of secondary devices. I filled it with two WD Red 2 TB drives, and I run them in a RAID 1 configuration (fully redundant). Actually, I use Synology's proprietary version of this that does the same thing. I also plug my old USB external drive into the 212j as another backup. I keep the music on the 212j and USB drive, and I keep the laptop files on the laptop with Time Machine backup to the 212j. This seems like a common home configuration. I should probably add another USB drive to the mix to periodically back up and keep off site, but this configuration is much more functional than the laptop to USB hub to USB drive I previously had. I could also opt for a cloud storage service.Since the old USB drive was too clunky to use as a media server, and I wanted to convert my digital music collection to lossless files (downloading new high-resolution files and re-ripping my CDs, AGAIN, hopefully for the final time), and the collection was far too large to fit on my computer drive, I needed a NAS. The 212j performs this task admirably. It was not trivial to set up, but nor was it an agonizing ordeal. If you know your way around your computer pretty well and have a modicum of networking knowledge, you'll be fine with this. If not, you'll still be fine, it'll just take a little longer. Critically, the documentation is very good, and I found everything I needed in the manual.Otherwise, the unit runs reliably, quickly, and quietly. I'm only utilizing the most basic functionality as a file server, which is also common. My 212j is connected to an Airport Extreme router. My laptop has no trouble accessing the 212j from either a wired or Wi-Fi connection to the router. I do not access the 212j remotely, outside of my home network, over the internet, but I installed the iPad app, which uses the remote protocol, and seems to work. I have not yet explored just what I can do with the iPad and 212j other than browse files, but seamless access from iPad to 2 TB worth of storage on the NAS would be very cool.The 212j with drives set me back $400, so it's not a trivial investment. But that buys you pretty high performance for home use, yet it's not overkill. It's much more satisfying than a USB drive as a back up and file server. My Time Machine backups to the USB drive were bogging my computer down to unusable levels&#8212;no longer an issue with the 212j. Although I can't scientifically ascribe that to the 212j itself, it's fair to say it performs backups very well. It's also much easier to use with multiple computers in the house, and serves up my music to my laptop (which subsequently feeds a DAC and hi-fi) seamlessly. Storage is vast and redundant and backups are smooth and quick.Most of my research that led me to this product was from computer audio enthusiast forums, but media serving is just one great application of a robust file server. The 212j clearly sells well on Amazon; it was the number one bestselling NAS when I bought it, and held solidly more than four stars in average reviews. For good reason.

If you use a tripod (and you WILL need to), you can't plug in the AC adapter to save on the short battery life, because mounting it on to a tripod covers the access to the AC connection.2. Battery life is very short.3. If you want to protect the lens, you will need to buy the lens adapter and then buy a protective lens.4. You can't take still photos with the flash if you are using the lens adapter BECAUSE the adapter casts a shadow from the flash onto your pictures.5. The automatic settings are horrible. The auto focus, auto white balance, auto anything will give you the worst results if shooting indoors.6. You cannot adjust the manual focus or anything else once you begin recording.7. Quality is very poor when recording indoors without an enormous amount light.Save your money. Buy a camera with better features. I am waiting for the Panasonic HDC-SD1 due in March.
$SUMMARY.: Sounds like a great camera - But it's NOT

$review_text.: This is my first LCD TV and I did a LOT of research. Out all all of the TVs I looked at, this is the only one with almost 100% positive reviews on all websites.  Now I know why! I don't have HD cable service or a fancy Blu Ray, but the picture quality on this TV is amazing.  The smart motion technology is a fantastic feature.  Once I fiddled with the sound options some, it provides a great sound quality.  This has some pretty fantastic energy smart features, however, I found the smart techonolgy with it made the screen a little too dark for me with no lights on.  So, I adjusted it to the medium energy saving mode and now I love it!  This TV was at a great price and Amazon beat every competitor by at least $70.  Only negative I have is that I received free 3-5 day shipping but it took 10 days to get here.  If I had paid for shipping, I would have complained to Amazon.  Since I didn't pay, I didn't complain.Overall, this is a great purchase and I would recommend to anyone!

$REVIEW.: I bought this cable to replace an older Belkin mini-stereo audio cable that I had been using for years. This new cable was a bit thinner gauge wire and the connector is also shorter. This combination results in a cable that is unable to plug into my Samsung Galaxy S2 because the connector is too short with my cell phone case attached. The case is a thin rubber item and doesn't add more than a few mm to the thickness but that is enough to keep this cable from working there. Primarily I use this with an iPod Touch but it has the same issues with plugging in while it has a case on. My old Belkin never had a problem as it has a longer connector but this one struggles. When I do get it plugged in the cord will short out frequently if it is bent even slightly. I have found a better cable at the local Big Lots that does not short out like this one. This is a garbage cord and should be avoided unless you only intend to plug it into a device once and leave it stationary for the rest of your life. Not durable, not a quality component, not worth any amount of money.

It's tiny, which is to say that six would fit into that little pocket on the right side of your jeans, and it works as well as the Mic on an IPhone.  This simple device renders your IPod Touch Skype compatible, allows you to use Shazam, etc.It's great, it's extremely portable and it's cheap as dirt. One comment below claimed it cuts off the sound so it's useless for ape calls. Put the IPod on speaker Think before you criticize. Another claims it fell apart after one use.

$review_text.: The other reviewers have said pretty much what needs to be said.  They are a little bright, meaning there isn't much bass.  If you want more bass, crank it up on your player.  The highs and midrange are perfect.  If I could "define" their sound, I would say that they sound "precise."  That is, music comes through super clear -- you will hear everything (e.g., a guitarist shifting his hand along the strings of his guitar).  If you have low bitrate mp3's, you will notice the compression noise with the Etymotics because of their clarity (even though you cannot hear the noise in cheaper headphones or speakers).  Thus, with the Etymotics, it pays to have higher quality sound files.They isolate sounds very well.  After a long day, they are fun to listen to when relaxing because all background noise disappears and you can immerse yourself in your music.  This isolation is great for loud environments (e.g., plane trips), but the drawback is that you will not hear background sounds, so be careful using them in environments where you need to be cognizant of ambient sounds.  For comparison, I have Sennheiser noise isolation headphones, which sound good, but do not sound as good as the Etymotics and do not isolate sound as well as the Etymotics.The Etymotics are relatively comfortable.  Even if you don't plug them into your ears deeply, they "stick" well and don't fall out.  I'm not a big earbud person at all (e.g., I cannot wear the standard Sony earbuds because they will not stay in my ears), but the Etymotics are comfortable & do not fall out.  If you have a chance, try them out before buying to make sure they are comfortable to you.Bottom line: they sound great, but are a little bright and are a little expensive.  I bought mine during a sale for $82 shipped.  While this is still expensive, they are a very high quality product.  With the Etymotics, you get a quality set of earbuds with precise sound and super isolation.  If this is what you are looking for, the Etymotics are about as good as they come.

$REVIEW.: Listen up people this capture devices works but when installing the drivers you will think it doesn't


First when you insert the capture device into the usb it will automatically search for the drivers on windows 7
Don't worry let it do it's thing

Eventually windows 7 will install 2 of the 3 drivers needed
You see that two have been installed by the check marks and the "X" mark will be the one you need from the disk
The disc that omes with the device is wierd
Some computer recognize it some don't

With your cd/dvd drive it seems like nothing is on the disc but there is


It happened to me too


If thats the case try another dvd drive


I know my laptop did not see anything on the disc but my desktop saw it just fine
So what I did was copy the entire disk to a usb drive for installation on my laptop
Once you do that autoplay the usb drive and install just the drivers


If you don't have another computer google the device

A guy on youtube has downloaded the drivers

After installing the drivers windows 7 will ask you to restart the computer

Do so and DO NOT UNPLUG THE DEVICE!!!

After the restart the third driver will be installed in your program files and in your windows 7 driver folder but you won't need to do anything else

In your device manager you should have three new devices
Two under sound and one under usb


The devices should be named USB28285, USB2828X AND A USB COMPOSITE DEVICE
Now the problem where people think this device doesn't work is because of the crap software

DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE
It will crash your computer and make you think the device doesn't work
The fact is it's the software that screws everything up

I don't care how you get it but find "Debut video capture software"
It works the best with this device


You'll be able to change option from component to composite and how you want to record

Like others have said you will find a slight buzz/tone to the audio for some reason so run your audio through a mixer into your mic plug


Its not bad but if you listen real good you'll hear it

The componenet capture is amazing at 480i


It is NOT truely HD but as close as you can get

You will be very satisfied.....that is once you get the device working.

$review_text.: I've had mine since September and took it along on a short vacation to Michigan and Florida
 I came home with maybe 150 images set mostly on Aperture priority for the trip
 Thinking the f8 setting may help the sharpness I can't say it helped at all

 Possibly the dof changed but I'll have to push it a little harder with some more challenging dof requirements

 As others have mentioned the GPS does draw down the battery quite fast especially in log mode in a couple of short days for me


I did drop the camera once onto concrete from 2 ft or so
 It damaged the metal band near the flash but otherwise all works well.Pros:  Lightning fast start-up and shutter response.The GPS is handy.Very good low light performance.Not a bad price point.Cons: The GPS is handy but slow to acquire a location (  100ft) and draws down the battery fast.Weak flash.Colors get muddy in the fine details, yellows and green especially

 I find this true in my other Canon Power shot A710-IS as well and the fall colors in Michigan especially took a hit.Edit:  October 2013


 I've started getting lens errors occasionally and have to power off the camera to "fix" it.Edit:  March 2014

 Getting "lens errors" continuously now and the camera shuts off


 So I guess it's all over for this one
2 1/2 years was it's life span.I've down graded the rating to two stars.

$REVIEW.: I first owned an Acer netbook without the touch screen

After 3 years' of good performance, the Acer sometimes just won't start until multiple reboots , so I bought this one in case Acer dies permanently


Compared to Acer, this one has three weakness: it is noticeably slower, its keyboard is less comfortable (for example, I use Shift a lot on the right, but this one's Shift key is especially tiny on the right.); and the screen is not as sharp
The battery life also seems shorter, but this might be because of the touch screen


But, I still use this quite often so far, on conference trips where I need a fair amount of typing but do not want to carry anything heavy.

$REVIEW.: Right, this is a no-brainer item. An Ethernet cable F-F connector, which means that you plug one end of each of two Ethernet cables into this little doohickey and then you have in effect a longer cable. In my case I wanted to connect the output side of this guyCables to Go 37133 2-Port RJ45 Splitter/Combiner Cable, Gray 6-Inch (Single Unit*)into my existing cable to carry two signals over my in-wall Ethernet cable.It works just fine for that. There is no issue. Nor is there an issue with the price (I got it for $0.92 and free shipping). You can't beat that.Problem is that I usually order things when I need it. Not 6-8 weeks in advance. So when I ordered this little guy on November 27, I was expecting it to arrive in the same vicinity date-wise as my other stuff - the spliiter/combiner mentioned above and the two short Ethernet cables to connect the router to the combiner.Nowhere on the product page is there any indication that this product ships with an incredibly long delivery time - it ships from mainland China. Again, it ships first-class and free of charge, which means that there is no way they made a profit off my $0.92 order, but it takes a long time. For me the expected delivery time was December 21 - January 10.  The product did arrive here even faster, (on December 8), but by then I've simply ordered another one for $6 (including expedited shipping through Prime) which I had received by December 1st.Note that if you click on the seller name and then check their page there is a table showing shipping times and things. There is no intent to deceive and they are cheap and ship for free. If you can plan ahead and order with a long lead time, then sure, go ahead and us these guys. If you need it quick, there are other vendors selling the same thing with quicker delivery.

$review_text.: Came in original packaging by Infinity and was perfectly packaged, no damage or what so ever to the speaker.I purchased this centre speaker to add to my Harman Kardon / Infinity 5.1 speaker system. Before this unit I had a cheap centre speaker because I did not think a center speaker would add much to the Dolby Digital experience... Man was I wrong!Played all my DTS and DD demos I have and the spectrum is way more full now. The center speaker even pumps out some serious bass which you would not expect from a small speaker.The quality of the build is very high, the speaker weighs a lot which most of the times is a good sign, speaker wise. The wire connectors are also of a high quality standard.This speaker will make watching movies and PS4 gaming a lot more fun!

 It charges rapidly and is good to take on trips plus you can charge your Kindle and read at the same time


 I never charge using a USB port
It can be used to charge many of your other electronic devices too

 That said I think it's ridiculous that the adapter isn't included with the Touch
 Some people don't own a computer and need to be able to plug into an electric outlet

$REVIEW.: I had a day/night camera that I bought on eBay a few years ago. I could never see at night, however the day was OK for 420 TVL. It showed the trees as being purple ugh, I paid about 30.00 for it included was the power supply.I did my research on the VideoSec cameras on Amazon, and had one in the cart, until I read up on this camera.  My previous camera had 28 LED's, in order to see my black car at night I had to put black foam rubber around it, and even then it was hard for me to see. That was because I had it facing a window  so it just reflected off my white backed curtains, and blinds.I installed this outdoor camera indoors because of the price, and 600TVL, I'm not so sure it's 600, but it gives a very good picture on my flatscreen.  For those of you who say you can't see at night.  Take electrical tape, and cover the 4 LED's, and you'll have a great black, and white video, I promise.  Just as long as you have a decent light source, I park under a street light.About the housing shield on top of the camera, and the mount, I removed it because it was useless it didn't give a 90 degree angle, so I mounted it on a mini tripod I had for my HD camcorder, and that did the trick.

$REVIEW.: I wanted a bag which could serve both as a handbag and a quality camera bag. This fits the bill very nicely. The internal padded camera holder is just like those in standard camera cases. It's Velcro-adjustable inside, and the entire thing is removable so that when you don't want to carry your camera(s) you can simply remove it and your other stuff is still in the bag. I really like the zippered extension- great when you need the added room, and great when it minimizes the size when you don't need it. The bag is quite roomy and you could add some padded containers from other cases if you need to carry additional equipment that doesn't fit in the supplied padded insert.I would have liked to see additional separate storage sections, for example, most handbags have a zippered segment inside which can hold a fair number of things. I find that I have to use little flexible plastic cases to keep my things separated. On the outside, I'd have liked the pockets to come up a bit higher, and perhaps a drawstring or elastic on the largest pocket on the end. But these are very small concerns, and don't really change my rating of a full 5 stars.I am longwaisted, and have had problems with straps not being long enough in the past. This strap is wonderfully designed- it's more than long enough, the bag hangs extremely comfortably and the strap has the added (removable!) adjustable padding for your shoulder.Lowepro has long been a favorite camera case supplier of mine, and this only adds to my appreciation of their products.

$REVIEW.: I love the overall look, feel and design of this case. However, there are a few things that made me give 4 stars instead of 5.First, they forgot to give me fan screws! as well as another bag of thumb screws. This made installing my fans a real F***ing chore!  I was building this computer from scratch, and didn't have time to haggle with their customer service to get a tiny bag of screws shipped out to me since I needed this rig put together asap to make sure all the components were operational. Luckily, my dad had a box of odd screws and nuts that I jury rigged into holding my fans in place.Second, the front and top panels are attached with plastic pins that you have to squeeze and push to detach. Considering all the other user-friendly devices on this case such as the removable HDD tray, these pins are a real stupid idea; especially since they're tucked away in small spaces and are virtually impossible to reach once you install all the internal hardware (so make sure you set it all up right the first time around).Third is minor, but it doesn't come with screens for any of the fan vents. It just has hole-puncher sized holes in the case, which provide an open doorway to dust and bugs (both of which I have problems with in my house).  Also, make sure you get at least 4 extra fans, because the case only comes with 3 generic ones that won't do any good on their own.Despite the these defects, I still like it since everything else on it works and fits perfectly.

$REVIEW.: I got this because my heavy  100-400mm  lens was killing my neck and shoulders

 This effectively shifts the weight away from my neck


 I don't let my camera hang on it except for brief periods, I usually hold the camera in one  hand

 That's good, because the screw came loose once
 I don't know how, I probably hadn't screwed it in completely

 Overall I'm satisfied


 Practice putting it on several times before going out in the field with it, otherwise you might be a bit confused as to which arm goes in first and spend several minutes trying to do that instead of being out there taking pictures (or maybe it's just me!)

Sends hi-def 720p video without any trouble. Crazy small, crazy cheap, very easy to setup. Will work with anything that expects Ethernet but you want WiFi instead.

$REVIEW.: I bought this for my iPad so I can listen to music or watch movies and shows with my wife without having to share one earphone. It works great. The only issue I have with this is that the sound quality decreases just a bit and sometimes I have to plug in my earphones a certain way for it to start working. But it gets the job done so I'm satisfied.

$REVIEW.: I got three of these cables to hook up: an xbox 360 to an HDTV, a computer to a tuner, and that tuner to a projector. All three have worked with absolutely no problems.Pro:+ cables feel solid, as do their plugs. This is a quality product.+ works great. I haven't had any problems with my HDMI interconnects+ packaging is nice. The cables came in a cardboard box, twisty-tied together. Beats cutting my hand on the usual plastic sarcophagus cables come in.+ price was significantly cheaper than anything I saw in stores, even for flimsier cables.Con:- none.Just for the record, the devices I have used these cables on are:- An Onyko 7.1 receiver with HDMI- An MSI NVidia N8400GS graphics card with HDMI- A Dell Inspiron 620 with built-in HDMI- An InFocus X9 projector- An Insignia 42" HDTVI'll have no hesitation to buy AmazonBasics cables when I need new cables in the future.

$review_text.: I have been considering buying either a Samsung or Acer Chromebook computer.I was aware that the Samsung does NOT have a user-replaceable battery, much like today's Apple Mac notebook computers, but what really amazes me today is that Samsung does NOT have a published price for a samsung-performed battery replacement on the Series 5 Chromebook!If you have to be certain about the cost of replacing the internal battery of Samsung's Series 5 Chromebook, you won't be able to find out until you send the computer to Samsung.Acer, on the other hand, has a ordinary battery that can be swapped out without taking apart the computer. And it can be bought on Ebay for about $35 (compatible) or $55 (Acer).Update 12-17-2011Having spent more time comparing the Samsung and Acer, I found the Acer much better in the following areas:1. The Acer has removable battery that doesn't require you to disassemble your computer. The Samsung has a huge battery inside (see ifixit.com) that cannot be replaced by anyone but Samsung. I cannot find a replacement battery for it on Ebay.2. The 2 Gb RAM in the Acer is removable, whereas the memory in the Samsung is SOLDERED in. In the event that it fails, you'd need to take it to Samsung for repair. You can imagine how much it will cost (parts + labor + shipping cost) compared to replacing the RAM yourself, not to mention lost time waiting. Because of this, ifixit only rated this Samsung's repairability at 6 out of 10.3. The Acer has a much better webcam at 1.3 Megapixels. Acer puts this excellent webcam in almost all of its webcam-capable notebooks. It has excellent resolution and color fidelity. Samsung just says it has a 1 megapixel webcam and there is no further information that can be found.4. The Acer has HDMI output so your Chromebook can be connected to a large screen TV for viewing. The HDMI interface carries both audio and video in digital format. Samsung just has an analog VGA connector for video only! Give me a break! Putting on this archaic interface on an advanced notebook like this in 2011?5. The Acer has a better a display at 1366 X 768 resolution, compared to Samsung's 1280 X 800.In addition, you can read all the reviews and watch YouTube videos comparing the two. Most agree that the Acer is superior and at a lower price.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Below is my text chat with a Samsung representative:You are now chatting with 'Vince'. There will be a brief survey at the end of our chat to share feedback on my performance today.Your Issue ID for this chat isVince: Hi, thanks for reaching out to Samsung tech support.

It needs to serviced by the authorized service technician.Visitor: i know, but you should have a price for battery replacement already published so potential customers can figure if the cost is reasonable or too high.Vince: Yes, it an valuable feed back.Visitor: apple has this for its line of notebook computers that do not have user-replaceable battery.Vince: I am really sorry; the cost details are not available regarding the service of the unit.Visitor: for a company as large as samsung, i cannot believe that you don't have a published price for battery replacement for the Series 5 Chromebook.Visitor: now that i am asking the question, can you find out for me and email me with an answer?Vince: I can understand your concern.Visitor: please answer my question.Vince: I will be right with you.Visitor: okVince: Normally there is an evaluation fee of $50 for the mobile computing device for out of warranty products.Vince: But we do not have the exact cost details regarding the service cost regarding the chrome book.Visitor: your chromebook product has been on the market for less than a year, but you still need to have this price published so that consumers can have an idea of the cost of battery replacement.Vince: Sure, I will forward you request to the concern department.Visitor: i cannot believe samsung does not have this price figured out at this time.Vince: I really apologize for the inconvenience.Visitor: i am sure the computer news world would be interested to know this fact.Vince: I am sorry, I couldn't help you fix the issue over the chat.

$review_text.: Out of the box I couldn't use my EarPods, the fall out of my ears just sitting still
With the addition of hue he Burton Acoustibuds for EarPods - they are now my go-to headphones for calls, listening in the office, etc.They improve the sound quality and bass response a good amount, but not night and day for me
I still have the more expensive apple earbuds that I use when I am listening to movies or something I want really good quality on,and Bose for when I fly.But if you have the EarPods now and don't use them because of fit issues, definitely drop the 10$ and get some of these they are well worth it!

$REVIEW.: to preface this - I've ordered multiple things on amazon over the last few years, based on customer feedback. I have found that customer feedback has been EXTREMELY accurate time and time again, and it is my duty to finally review this and other items for others.I've read SO MANY REVIEWS trying to pick one. The "break-ability" was the biggest part, and speed was the second. We all know these things are cheap - but having the USB insert part covered is CRUCIAL. This prevents 99% of the reasons why other USB sticks break. The choice is easily between this USB stick, and the one that slides out (I forget the name). However, this one I found to be cheaper, and it's nice to have it on the key chain (slide out does not have an option to attach it with you).Great product, great speeds - happy with this purchase.

$REVIEW.: YES it's incredible! It works!!! This little guy is fast and portable! Before buying i've made an enormous research and, now that i have it in hands, i definitly made the right choice. I'm a student, so it works very well when i have to take to so many different places. The battery,  OHH MY!! You will get tired of it...it never ends. The keyboard, you will have to get used to (i'm writing on him right now) but is like a butter. The screen is very bright and nice, the size it's perfect. It have no cd-drive, but you can mount a virtual one, and watch some movies in ISO, the INTERVIDEO that comes with it works perfect. It's on my lap right now, and it's not getting warm, i can't even feel it. Before i forget, this guy is solid...it's so well made, you will definitly notice the solid structure. So, on resume...it worth much more then cost...go for it!!!!

$REVIEW.: The TomTom GO930T is a very good navigation device, works as advertised, includes maps from America and Europe so far no real complaints.  Navigation is very accurate, the lane support is great and acquiring a satellite connection is done in a very short moment.  I wouldn't give it a 5 star rating because the internal memory is to small for today's world - 4GB isn't that bad but doesn't allow you to get both included (America & Europe) maps onto the device at the same time. At least you can extend memory with an SD card to get that solved.

$REVIEW.: Panasonic is a great company when it comes to keeping the past linked to the future, the VHS Picture is up converted to 1080p 60HZ and it looks quite good, VHS are capable of recording high def from a Technical point of view but to have a tape with 1080p image you'll need a tape that gonna end up weighing about 5 pounds because of the amount of tape you'll need but this player does a decent job to clean the VHS picture when using an HDMI Cable

For the bluray the only problem I would say is the load time I bought this as an extra Bluray player, I have a PS3 60GB model and I don't want to wear it off, so I am using the Panasonic for bluray playback but when you are used to the speedy PS3, everything else looks slow in comparison
The Player is BD Live compatible with the use of an SD Card( over 1GB) and has YouTube access and Amazon Video which has some pretty decent pricing for movies and TV shows
the system also does DTS HD and Dolby True HD in bitstream and PCM, the Video processing is excellent the picture looks very clear and clean

In conclusion you have a well above medium device that plays almost all media and up convert it to 1080p, excellent player.

$REVIEW.: This small unit has surprisingly decent sound paired with my IPod classic


The reason it isn't worthy of a 5 star rating is the shortcoming of the internal rechargeable battery

When operating unit with battery power the bass response is severely throttled,presumably to extend battery run time.(which btw is pretty short)


If you are using this primarily to run off an electrical outlet you will be pleased with the results.

$review_text.: I wanted a good, comfortable replacement for the Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite, which is no longer available.  This keyboard is laid out virtually identically to the NK Elite, feels very sturdy, and is very good to type on!  I'm a software engineer, so I spend alot of time on a keyboard...I hope this remains available in case I have another keyboard fail on me at some point.Later notes:I should clarify my previous comments, based on other reviews;  If you liked the MS Natural Keyboard Elite, and its original predecessor, you will love this keyboard.  If you used some of the other "natural" keyboards, such as the 4000, 6000 or 7000, you may *not* be so happy...MS has experimented with different layouts on each of the keyboards, and they can differ dramatically from each other!  I ultimately didn't care as much for the later keyboards (all of which I tried out); they were lighter and more streamlined in some cases, but the positions of keys relative to each other often changed - which breaks touch-typing - and other things were just unfamiliar and awkward.  Also, the lighter keyboards often didn't "stay put" as well as the Elite, which I found annoying.  So, as always, YMMV...

$review_text.: I have a Kindle keyboard, and I have a Timbuk 2 case for it which I wanted to replace when giving the Kindle to my husband. Because of the multiple versions of Kindles and their size differences, it appears as though the various case manufacturers are trying to utilize products which can fit more than one version of Kindle. This is a different model slightly larger than my first (model XXS) and while I could probably live with that, I'm not happy about the fact that Timbuk 2 removed one of the three strips of Velcro (the middle strip) used to securely close the case. It opens way too easily which makes me feel as though any unit stored inside is not secured as I would prefer.FYI: the packaging shows that this case can be used for both the Kindle Fire and Kindle Keyboard.

$review_text.: This has been so far the best keyboard I ever bought. Its nice looking and easy to get accustomed to, just spend a few days typing in it and I can type as fast as I used to with the previous keyboard I had (standard). Great palm rest support allows you easy typing, also it comes with a lot of extra keys, and they are easily customizable using the provided/downloaded software from Microsoft.ProsEasy to use.It has a lot of keys.It is pretty good looking, it has a great palm rest support and it is also pretty sturdy.Great Windows 7 support, just plug and play.Cons.Space bar makes a lot of sound when pressed. (not too much but i kinda don't like it)Despite the fact that it comes with multimedia keys, it lacks the buttons for previous and next track, so it's a little annoying, there is a work around to assign them to one of the 5 "favorites keys", but you have to do a little Windows registry hack.Sometimes the extra keys lag a little while when you first pressed them, it disappears right after you press another key or the same one, I think it's a known issue of the Microsoft Intellitype software, I hope they fix it someday.Bottom line.Great keyboard, great ergonomics, but the space bar sound its too loud for me. Other than that, I'd recommend it for people who want to take care of their wrists and want to change to an ergonomic type keyboard.

$REVIEW.: The iMM288-01 is a very basic stereo speaker docking unit for the iPhone and/or iPod

 The docking station has only three control buttons: on/off, + and - volume control.The unit worked right out of the box and installed the required app as soon as I plugged in the iPod, but I am moderately disappointed in the sound quality


 It sounds a little "tinny" and the bass tones could use improvement.On the positive side, the iLuv app does include access to Internet Radio, multiple clock displays, alarm sound options and access to some weather information

 Since the unit itself is simple and the app installed easily even someone technologically challenged can feel confident that they can buy and operate this dock
 Of course there are also tons of other apps that you can use if you prefer to customize your options.I wanted a docking station that would charge my ipod so that I can listen to podcasts while I'm cooking without running down my battery the way I currently do when connecting to a set of regular stereo speakers and for this purpose the product suits my needs


 Still, even at the discounted price of $68.64 it seems a little overpriced considering its mediocre sound quality.Ease of Use: 5 starsSound Quality: 2 starsPrice: 2 starsOverall Rating: 3 stars

$REVIEW.: I used this charger for a couple months to charge my iPad 3 at work


I had it plugged into a power strip, and conscientiously shut it down when not in use
It didn't travel, wasn't repeatedly plugged and unplugged..
it basically had the best life a charger could expect to have

And it only lasted about a month before the problems started.First, it just took a little wiggling..
I'd plug the iPad end of the cable into my iPad, and nothing


A little wiggle to the charger itself (not the usb cable) would get it working
Within another month, I had to make sure the power strip was situated just so, and just the right amount of tension was on the usb cable to get it to work

A few weeks after that, and I had to literally hold the charger against the power strip, with just the right amount of upward (towards the amazon logo) force, or it wouldn't work.I finally decided to break it down and try to fix it


I believed that the folding plug mechanism was at fault, since that was the most obvious component affected by my wiggling and tensioning shenanigans

Unforunately, it's designed to be disposable -- it was extremely difficult to get apart

It would've been easier if I'd known about the screw hidden under the sticker on the back, but I'm not sure that would've saved it
In prying the glued edges apart, I destroyed a capacitor along the top edge

 Despite ruining the charger, I decided to see what was causing the problem in the first place


It woked by having the back ends of the plug prongs rub against metal plates every time the plug is folded out
The plates looked clean, so I don't think it was a matter of corrosion..
the plates and prongs must have stopped physically making contact.Not sure if it was a QC problem or a design flaw, but I won't be buying another charger of this design.

$review_text.: I was a bit skeptical, but after reading the reviews here on Amazon and checking my favorite LInux, Android, and OSX forums, I decided to bite. Amazon Prime next day only added $3.98 to the already low price, so I did that too. It arrived the next day. Since I do some developing, I frequently flip between different Linux distros, OSX, and, (ugh), Windows 7. I was especially happy to see Linux compatible alongside Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and OSX compatible on the packaging. Made me smile. I plugged it into my desktop system running ubuntu. Ubuntu auto-configured and asked which wifi network I wanted to connect to, was able to connect to my Airport Extreme and to my Android Wifi hotspot, no problems. Switched to Windows 7 Ultimate, and Windows 7 saw the new device asking for disc and to configure. Popped in the miniCD, then it asked which Wifi network I wanted to connect to. Was able to connect again to my Airport Extreme and my Android wifi hotspot. I was even able to share the internet connection from my Android wifi hotspot to my Xbox360 Kinect via ethernet cable directly to the Xbox. My Xbox was already set to Automatic Network Configuration, fired up online with no problems.  It handled whatever I threw at it without missing a beat. Love the blue LED traffic indicator, letting me know its working. Tried a few other distros and a few bridge setups and it never missed a beat. This is definitely, hands down, the single best cross-platform USB Wifi Adapter I've ever come across. Makes my life as a dev a great deal easier. I like it so much I ordered another one for my in-law's old machine. Extremely happy with this.

$REVIEW.: Ive never used a grip before so I can't compare to an OEM Canon grip or any other.  My initial impression is simply "wow".  Makes a huge difference in holdability and comfort. I have medium hands and the grip on the XSi never felt comfortable.  I LOVE holding and using my camera now, especially in portrait orientation.  Quality feels just as good as the XSi body. Rubber grip is even better.  Would have given 5 stars but the latch for the battery tray protrudes jut a tad and feels a little delicate. Not sure how it will hold up over time.  I just wish Opteka would add some more rubber on the grip on the right side where my right palm rest. Othetwise, i love it.

$REVIEW.: First off, let's clear some myths about "noise canceling", from the below reviews. No headphones, not even the Bose QC-15 will cancel out voices nor people talking. "Noise canceling" does not work on those frequencies. These headphones are designed to reduce low-frequncy "white noise" up to around 1000Hz. It does not work on people talking, noise in the gym, or other noises that are not constant. A more appropriate term for all of these headphones should be "noise reduction".The noise it does significantly reduce is the low frequency rumble of engine noise while in an airplane, and also fans, dishwasher noise, and air conditioner noise. I work in a large computer data center with lots of racks of servers and huge air coolers. These headphones reduce a lot of that noise to the point that I can listen to my music at low volume and hear all details of the music. There is a little bit of hiss introduced when turning the noise canceling on, but it is barely noticeable. The headphones are a good size for people with bigger heads, and they fit completely around the ear. Very comfortable for extended periods of usage.The sound quality is good, but not the best you can get. They also have a lower sound quality while "off". This is probably due to the fact, that when you turn the noise canceling on, this also turns on an amp too. A lot of small MP3 players like ipods/iphone will not sound good with these headphones, unless you keep the noise canceling feature on.Update: After owning these headphones for awhile and comparing them to the Bose QC-15, these headphones are being returned and I bought a pair of Bose QC-15 instead. The noise canceling on these headphones just wasn't good enough for every day use in my computer lab. The Bose have much better noise reduction, fit tighter for a more sealed fit, and also have better sound quality. I can hear all the details in my music with the Bose, that just sound muddy with the Sennheiser. Sennheiser seems to have dropped the ball this time around regarding sound quality.
$SUMMARY.: Very comfortable fit, good reduction in lower frequency noises.

There is no way to enable bluetooth once you switch it off using keyboard shortcuts on Apple. Anyway, I was advised to buy a mouse with a chord. I had plans to return this but discovered that this easy simple mouse will prove to be faster and more convenient to me than the new wireless magic mouse. I like it more because it does the job faster, easier and has a nice conventional feel to it. Strongly recommended. Very very good value for money. I am definitely keeping it.

$REVIEW.: i bought this camera about a month ago and have been experimenting with it ever since. i bought it after reading several rave reviews (was rated #1 customer-purchase last year in some worldwide research). i bought the lens kit and i would have to say that if you are SLR savvy then skip the lens kit because to me the quality and output of this lens is just "average" nothing special / you can buy or acquire a much nicer lenses (i.e. I bought some inexpensive canon FD and pentax super takumar lenses from ebay and works perfect with an adapter also available on ebay). just this weekend, i was at a family event, took pics using the T1i plus super-takumar 50mm f1.4 lens -  results were real nice; crisp quality in image and in color!  i did black/white video (same lens) and it looks real sharp / like proffessional grade!  i would recommend the canon eos rebel T1i with a caveat to use other lenses / not the kit lens / just my opinion;  canon makes real good products and someone told me that they even use canon lenses these days to film tv productions. last note from me, if you buy from amazon, be prepared to see the price fluctuate (most likely you will pay more for it today than next week / that happened to me / price was $20 cheaper the following week / and amazon will not give you a refund to guarantee lowest price.

$REVIEW.: After doing a lot of research, I decided this lens would be perfect for my needs (action/sports shots of my kids)


The pictures from this lens are just beautiful with my Nikon d5100! The zoom lets me take pictures from very far away

Bokeh is beautiful


While it's not super fast with the auto focus in slightly low light, I didn't expect it to be, and it's still reasonably fast
I did have to return the first lens I received because it was obviously defective with how much it would hunt for focus indoors, but the replacement lens I received is much, much better (as always, easy to exchange through amazon and they even cover the return shipping charges)


One thing I wasn't quite prepared for is just how large and heavy this lens is

For reference, it's about 3" in diameter and 7" long

Previously, I had been using a Nikon 55-200 mm lens for zoom
This lens is significantly bigger than that one
I'm starting to get used to the weight, but I didn't realize the difference would be quite so extreme
I sold my 55-200m, and I'm keeping this one since it's great for speed and I get the extra zoom.

$REVIEW.: I bought this TC to go with my 70-200/2.8

 I needed something with some more reach in medium light situations on my DX body (D90)

 The 70-200 w/TC is still very sharp


 Occasionally, if the focus is on the wrong end, it hunts a bit

 Focus with the TC is a bit slower than without, but not by much


 In those very few situations where this matters, I roughly pre-focus with the 70-200's excellent focus ring.Overall, I am very happy with the 70-200 & TC combo
 As an added bonus, the TC17 also works great with my 105/2.8 AFS micro

 This lens is slower focusing to begin with, and I don't notice any significant slowing down of focus or reduction in IQ with this combo for portraiture and other medium distance work

 Some reduction in quality at far distances/infinity, but a great combo in macro work.



$SUMMARY.: Works great, doesn't get in the way

The sound quality is evident but not as important to me as fit

These are called Ultra-Fit 500's but I think that is misleading, and an attempt to appeal to a common problem with ear phones - fit
If you want really high quality sound go for Shure, Bose, or Klipsch and pay the price


If you want great fit, these do not fit the bill for me
You will need to try some and see for yourself what works for you


Not recomended by me


They need a slimmer over-the ear piece.

 He then says, I'm sorry we don't have any web documentation for Mac & Skype 6.0

 Sorry


 Good-bye

 I asked for &#34;Tier 2&#34; support or to speak with his manager, but no reply has come.

$REVIEW.: Hide it from your family or it will disappear. My New Trent products have a tendency to disappear when my wife and kid see it not being used. This rugged, compact device will easily get you through a hurricane with power to spare. My sister, who lives in Florida just bought one to use as a backup for her electronic devices in case the power goes out. She absolutely loves it. It will recharge your device five or six times without a recharge.Out of the box it only took about two hours before it was completely charged, but I left it on for about 10 to 12 hours just to get a good start.The stylish gray and black unit is well designed to withstand the elements and it will fit nicely in a pocket or a purse. The contacts are protected by a snap open and shut cover that protects the unit from dirt and water when not in use. The inside of the cover actually inserts part of the cover into the area where the ports are located. This unit is clearly designed withstand the elements.I haven't dropped it or thrown it across the room to torture test it but I'm pretty confident it would survive. Using the device could not be more simple. When charging, the 4 blue lights that are built into the front cover indicate the continuous state of the charging process until all 4 lights glow. When powering a device you simply connect it to the correct outlet and push the button on the side to start the power.With two USB ports capable of handling both Apple products with a 5V2.1A rating and Android products with a 5V1A rating, this little power pack is all you need. Take it on trips or anywhere you have no backup power and it will make your stay as comfortable as possible. It doesn't come with any special cables for your devices so make sure you don't forget them. It does come with a USB cable that will allow you to charge it from your computer and then use it to power devices with a USB connector. Don't pass up an opportunity to get it right the first time. This is the device you want when compromising is not an option. I'm looking forward to more great products from New Trent.

They are really big headphones and have a lot more power than my ipod or computer push out normally, so I was looking for a way to amplify it and this is just what I needed. The equalizer settings are fun to play around with, the bass goes so high on red and blue that it makes the headphones rattle and cheeks shake at high volume. It makes my regular phone earphones which I use for work sound way better. I also just got the FiiO L3 LOD cable I ordered to go with my ipod and it's a great combination with the FiiO E6.

$REVIEW.: So far this seems like a great camera from a hardware point of view (as others have described better than I can), but the software is just awful.  It's from Pixela.  I'm running on Vista Ultimate.You get two CDs of software, "Transfer Utility" and "VideoBrowser".  So of course you try to install both.  However, you cannot, you get user unfriendly warnings.  Only when you search the Canon support web site do you find that you can only install one or the other.  VideoBrowser is a superset of the Transfer Utility so I installed it.When you use the VideoBrowser utility, you are supposed to set up the camera in a particular fashion as described in a support page on canon.com, and then plug in the USB cable.  The computer is supposed to recognize it and start up the VideoBrowser.  Instead, you get a warning message "There is no disk in the drive.  Please insert a disk into \Device\Harddisk2\DR7".  Eh?In the end, I can only get videos from the camera to the computer by using the Windows file explorer and treating the camera as just a USB hard drive.  At that point, I seem to be able to use VideoBrowser to do basic edits.  I plan to use Adobe Premiere for most editing anyway.Overall, a poor experience.  But with the hardware so good, I still rate it 4*.

When the video card it not in high quality graphics mode it has a very low watts consumption, but when playing, my crappy  power supply (agiler 700w) overheats in an hour, so consider using this video card for long periods together with a certified power supply o an extra cooled one.Instalation with windows 7 was super fast, I think it took me 5 minutes to fully install hardware and software, took me longer to uninstall the nvidia drivers.

$review_text.: This product has many great documented features, but it doesn't deliver anything but grief as nothing hardly works.  My dreams and aspirations were crushed as I became frustrated with the bugs, quirks, and general lack of functionality.  Here are some of the many quirks I came across.--- wan dhcp client broken as it gets invalid addresses--- wireless overall unstable - disconnects for unknown reasons--- non-tcp protocols cannot route between wireless and lan (problems for mac os 9 w/ appletalk)--- sometimes my own dhcp server wouldn't work across wifi and lan lines.--- security features causes problems------- mac filtering made some clients wifi cards not work w/ router------- WEP would make other clients wifi cards not work w/ router--- routing features don't work for Internet access, e.g. if you have subnet of 2 (192.168.2.0/28), all computers on that subnet cannot access internet. Problem with router's NAT facility.--- routing cannot support classless routing, e.g. 192.168.1.32/27.  And because you CAN ONLY NAT out from 192.168.1.x type of addresses, routing feature is 100% useless.Essentially, I have to find creative strategies around the many flaws of this device.  The scary part is that I cannot secure the wi-fi network, which allows neighbors to snoop around or clog our bandwidth.UPDATE: Called their tech support about their routing problems.  We couldn't reach level 2 technical support because they were so busy, so he told me to e-mail support.  I did, and after a week, I have heard nothing from them.

$review_text.: First off, I'd like to qualify myself by saying that I know quite a bit more than the average person about digital cameras. It's really hard to believe someone who says a camera is "great" or "the best" when they really have no experience with other cameras.The LS753 is extremely easy to learn how to operate, has a VERY nice compact metal body, and is a great value at 5 megapixels for it's price tag.  Picture quality is pretty good, and colors are well saturated.  Redeye is surprisingly good for a compact camera, and there are plenty of scene modes.  Controls include: Exposure compensation, ISO, white balance(no custom), and long shutter for night scenery without using the flash (remember to use a tripod or steady surface!).  The editing software that comes with it is pretty useful if you have non, and replacement batteries are cheap.  The movie mode is also slightly about average.Downsides:  my biggest complaint is that pretty much everything resets when you turn the camera off, so by the time you set up your camera, the moment might be gone - very frustrating!  the date and time even reset when you leave the battery out too long!  there are no fast shutter or aperture controls, and no AF assist lamp so you can't take focused shots in "dim" light without the flash.  Not so great if you take lots of macro shots since all you'll see is flash glare.  Also, by saying "dim" lighting, I mean indoors, daytime, during the summer without DIRECT or very bright sunlight.  There's also a bit of purple fringing.Overall, a great camera if you just need it for point and shoot use.  Very nice colors and great resolution for the price.  In my opinion, one of the best things about this camera is the non existent redeye, since compact cameras are usually used for taking pictures of people, not scenery.  Other compacts have awful redeye.  Not recommended for creative shooting though.  The Canon ELPH S410 is about the same price but is 1 meg lower, has no scene modes or an action mode, but focuses better in low light and has better picture quality.  Sony W1 costs more and has limited control over shutter and aperture settings, and has an excellent movie mode.  Canon Powershot A75, A85, and A95 cameras have much more manual controls (which means you can take better pictures in different situations) and are much cheaper (except for the A95) but are bigger, though not too big.

$REVIEW.: These are great speakers for music, and good speakers for gaming and movies. With my indie or alternative music, these speakers highlight the bass and treble ranges, bringing it to life. However, they lack a strong mid-range, so for watching movies or gaming, they are a little too quiet. Despite this, they are still quite excellent speakers, especially since they are so cheap. I have $150 headphones, $90 earbuds, and these are better sound quality than either of those. Compared to speakers even twice their cost, these are the best I've found. Five stars for finding that sweet spot between price and quality.

I seem to get consistent communication between the mouse and the receiver as I've not noticed any performance problems.  Batteries last about a year and the mouse tells you when they are getting low by posting an alert.Also, I share this mouse with my two children.

$REVIEW.: A great flash, but it is complex. This is not for amateurs. Be prepared to spend hours learning how to use it.The manual is quite good, but doesn't fully explain the exposure from my point of view.I found it so powerful that it took me a while to get the settings right. Manual was easier than Auto, but had me reaching for the guide book all the time.Impressive remote ability, but disturbing when the camera flash goes off as well as the remote. You cant turn this off, but apparantly the camera uses this to trigger remotes, and will only open the shutter after the on camera flash has triggered. Took me ages to discover this - it's not in the manual.

This set is very easy to set up and use, and has an excellent picture.  I shopped for months and decided on Sony over Samsung mainly due to the matte screen vs. Samsung's glossy, reflective screen.  Delivery was not "white-glove", but was one delivery person who helped me lift the set onto a stand and removed all packing materials, which was fine for my needs.  I highly recommend this set.

$review_text.: Maybe I was unlucky with my copy of this lens hood. Maybe it is the tolerance of the product. Maybe it's what you get when you go for a replacement lens hood, but I got great replacement hoods of the same brand in the past that were just fine. This replacement lens hood shade is of mediocre quality and I would not buy it again. It does not fit well; it is too loose and feels wobbly.It looks okay, but the fit is just not what you would hope for. Looks are one thing, but I feel this hood might be lost soon or break at some point in the near future. Maybe you will be lucky with your copy, maybe you won't care about the fit and are happy with the looks. But I would not recommend the one I have to anyone.

$review_text.: The Arkon mount has a secure suction base for windshield and dash attachment.  The adjustment features are also very accommodating and easy to set up.  The adapter for the TomTom XL340M GPS provides a more secure mount for the device than the one provided by TomTom with the GPS.  Removing the GPS from the mount takes a little getting used to but well worth it considering the extra security it affords.  Arkon seems to have put consideration for the intended use into their products.

$REVIEW.: This lens takes amazing portraits.  It is sharp, you can use available light, you can get great background blurring which is creamy and the colors are beautiful.On a cropped sensor camera like my Rebel XTi, it isn't so good for landscapes - the 20mm 2.8 or 35mm f2 are much better, and for trying to get more distant details the 85mm f1.8 is great.  I have forced myself to shoot with this lens at times because it is so good - but I find that it works best as an amazing portrait lens.  And that isn't so bad.If eventually I get a full-frame sensor, this lens may well stay on my camera as much as the 35mm f2 does.If you are looking for a great, multipurpose lens on a cropped sensor, buy the 35mm f2 - even with its funny sound.  But on a cropped sensor, this 50mm f1.4 will give you awesome portraits -- or you're doing something very wrong.

I find ThermaPak (1) cools my laptop much better and faster (2) is rugged but easy to clean and (3) a wonderful, quiet alternative to fans. I am sometimes on my laptop 10+ hours a day, so I really needed something extremely efficient. This is a keeper.

$REVIEW.: This is a well-designed product that is extremely user friendly and that works very well. The interface is one of the best ones I have seen on any product: all the key features you would want in a thermostat are readily available. And it was pretty easy to install.First to installation. A family member did ours. He is the extended family 'handyman' but did not have any experience with a thermostat before. However it was extremely easy for him to install and I watched the whole process. First our house is around 7 years old and came with what I would call 'standard' programmable thermostats. We have upstairs and downstairs and 2 thermostats. The 2000WH, if our wiring had allowed it, would have been able to control both upstairs and downstairs. As it was there were just five wires to connect: heat, cool, fan, 24 VAC common, and 24VAC 'hot'.The previous installer had labeled all the wires so it was just a matter of writing down what each of the colors was for and the instructions clearly show you where each wire should go when rewiring it up to the 2000WH. It took around 30 minutes and a lot of that was going up into the attic to kill the power and drilling the necessary holes.Once installed the unit was very easy to program. There is a well-written user manual. One of the nice upgrade features from our previous thermostat was the 'auto' mode. Before we had to choose cool or heat. Now you can set it to auto and set a range, say 68 heat, 78 cool. The unit will either heat or cool as is appropriate. An even nicer feature is the fan mode for 'cycle'. My wife use to run the fan periodically to circulate air. Well the cycle fan mode does this automatically. Every 20 minutes or so the fan comes on for 10 seconds and this acts to keep the air 'fresh'.The interface as mentioned before is great. You have three buttons on the bottom, a main wheel for changing settings up and down that also acts a button, and a very nicely lit, easy to read, information packed display. It was extremely easy for me to program the Monday transition times and temps I wanted (fairly standard 4 time set-up: morning, day, evening, night). When you get to the end of the program the bottom right button is the copy button. You can then scroll and choose any other days you want to copy that program. Took a few minutes to get my weekdays and weekends set up.The proximity sensor works very well. No energy is wasted on lighting the display until you walk in front of it. It then lights up and turns off after a few minutes with no one there. 'Smart' thermostats are becoming very popular. I haven't personally usedNest Learning Thermostat - 2nd Generation T200577but from what I understand it comes with Apps for smartphones and tablets. In addition to the features I mentioned above, the 2000WH does have an onboard Runtime graph and if your system allows it, the ability to set a humidity and dehumidify level. Really all the advanced features most people could use or want short of being able to see the usage graphs and control changing temperature settings remotely. But having an App where you could change temps based on say having a change of plans could be useful. And right now the NEST 2 is roughly the same price as this so if control via the Internet is important you might want to consider the NEST.Since we have been using the 2000WH we have been more comfortable. The heating in this case seems 'smoother' and more pleasing even though we have had it set at the same temperature points as our previous thermostat. Programming was a breeze and it is nice to let the unit switch from heating to cooling. Also I am not sure how many of the smart thermostats could control two zones like the 2000WH. You just have to have a wired set-up that allows that or be willing to rewire your home. Our 2 story home could not take advantage of that feature.All in all a good product: it combines high tech with an easy user interface. But at the price point there might be better value such as the highly ratedHoneywell  RTH7600D Touchscreen 7-Day Programmable Thermostat. Especially if you don't need the dual state feature.
$review_summary.: Well designed thermostat: easy to install, easy to program, useful features, and works very well.

$review_text.: There is a recipe for getting very good quality sound out of a portable device.  It starts with your music.  128Kbps music files are never going to deliver the amount of detail you are hoping to hear.  I rip everything in a lossless format which preserves all of the detail found in a CD.  Upgrade your iTunes files.  Re-rip your CD's.  Do what you must.  But you have to start with good files.Next, you'll want a good pair of headphones.  Your stock earbuds are not going to cut it.  You'll probably have to spend about $50-60 at least.  Avoid the headphones that are more fashion-statement than audio device.  I am currently usingSuperlux HD668B Dynamic Semi-Open Headphonesand for earbuds you can't beatLogitech Ultimate Ears 350vi Noise-Isolating Headset (Silver).  Neither will set you back more than $60.  If you want your mind blown, get theAudio-Technica ATH-M50 Professional Studio Monitor Headphones with Coiled Cable.  Test the headphones on your home stereo with your upgraded music files so you have a frame of reference.Lastly, add this device.  Connect it via a line-out connector on your player.  FiiO sells various dock connectors.  Buy one because this package does not include it.  The sound will amaze you.  There are three EQ/Bass Boost settings accessed via a switch on the side.  I only need a little boost for the earbuds, none for full-size cans.  Play around with the settings until you get it set the way you like, then enjoy the sonic goodness.I would expect the E6 to be almost as good.  But I really like the removable battery and knurled aluminum volume knob on the E11.
$SUMMARY.: The missing ingredient for outstanding sound.

You just download the app, dock the phone/pad/etc and then it automaticalally syncs everything. It really did a good  job of tracking my night. The dog woke me up at 430am and I was up for an hour. I fell back asleep for a while. The graphics matched how I slept. The interface (app) is so easy to use. I love that it uses a censor to track as opposed to the Zeo, which makes you wear an uncomfortable headband. My only complaint is that the clock shines in my face all night, sometims disturbing my sleep. I wish there was an option to turn it off or turn down the brightness. Otherwise love this!

And that works just great with the eTrex Vista-C.Love the screen, very clear.Nice little "extras" included as well (functionailty wise).Little suprise: the eTrex Vista-C is a little shorter and a little wider than the older eTrex models. Later I found this to be an advantage; seeing the routing is much clearer to read (more space).Initially I read reviews of people complaining that the Vista-C did work with theirPC GPS software (iGuidance, DeLorme, etc). Well that is not entirely true; you do however need a little piece of software to get it going. It's called GPSGate from [...] ($14 if I'm right). And it works.One downside though: the maps (Garmin MapSource) are SOOOO expensive. At least the US should have been included.

$REVIEW.: Ok, I figure, being a Lenmar brand, the battery should hold a charge,but it doesn't.I figure I'll give it a complete charge and discharge a few times and a month to determine how reliable the battery is, before any reviews.After you fully charge it, it will work, but don't expect same power length as your original.Also, if you have it fully charge and let it sit for a week, without use, the battery will show empty, when you try to play it.So if you are going to use it, you must charge it the night before.  Kind of a pain.One note, to replace the battery was pretty easy, just watch the videos online, took about 10min.

$REVIEW.: This camera replaced an inexpensive one that I thought was adequate but wow what a difference!I use this in a small astronomical observatory to monitor the movements of the telescope which I operate from a remote location. Because of this use I especially needed good dark vision on the camera. This one has it. The ability to move it and zoom remotely is also a great advantage. I found the picture quality to be very sharp in daylight and although it's not quite as good at night it is the best I've seen on any surveillance camera. The focus adjusts quite well in the zoomed out position but not quite perfect in the zoomed in position. I love the presetable positions which makes it possible to move the camera quickly to a previously established view point.The case as well as mounting bracket are made of cast metal and feel extremely durable. It was easy to assemble and hook up and even comes with a 100 foot cable to complete the job. The only part I had to supply was the cable connector to connect it to the video in port on the TV monitor.The only feature that I could want that it doesn't have (at least I haven't found it yet) would be the ability to mount the camera in an upside down position so the camera can tilt up instead of down and then flip the image on the monitor so it doesn't show the object upside down. As it is I had to mount it with the best view available for my unusual application and live with the fact that it doesn't pan horizontally because of the way I have it mounted. If it had that feature it would expand it's usability even further.I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality surveillance camera.

$review_text.: I purchased this access point for VLAN & 802.1x features which are generally available on more expensive "enterprise" access points. It is possible that the unit I have is defective, but I can't help feeling that EnGenius marketing team are more competent than the engineering team.- I probably received a bad unit, but the ethernet port doesn't work when connected to a gigabit port. Force the port to negotiate at 100 or 10mbps and it works just fine. The access point doesn't provide option to downgrade its port to 10/100 mbps.- This is not exactly the AP's fault, but while it can blast the signal through floors and walls, the fact that it has smaller antenna gives it a hard time receiving signals from smaller devices like phones & tablets. What does this mean? These devices can hear the access point just fine, but no the other way around. -- It might be useful if you want to use several APs to expand your network. But if you want your gadgets to see significant improvement, you'll be disappointed. Case in point, my pocket router performs almost the same as EAP350 at the same distance & number of walls. -- If you want something that would likely extending the range for your gadgets, spread several APs across your living area, or at least get one with external antenna.- Be sure to check "Isolation" check box when configure VLAN ssid. It took me a while to realize that it was an option to enable VLAN tagging. Manual doesn't say anything about it. Maybe I'm just stupid. I dunno.... and here's my last straw ::- In my noisy(2.4ghz) residential setting, wireless performance is nowhere near its "ideal for bandwidth intensive & sensitive application" claim. While packet loss is rare with this access point, latency spikes up & speed drops intermittently. I tested this with several intel & realtek wifi nics and got the same problem. Maybe it works better in different environment, maybe it doesn't. But in terms of overall throughput & latency, in the same environment (also same wifi channel, ht settings, etc.), this access point performs worse than apocket router/access pointNeedless to say, this access point is going back.I was all hyped up by all the reviews & marketing materials from EnGenius. But at the end of the day,I guess it's still tough to find a reliable AP with 802.1q & 802.1x AP at this price range.As for VLAN/802.1q, I'll just grab a couple of reliable APs and connect them to separate VLANs and be done with it.(I experimented with several cheap APs with 802.1q support, each of them has its own drawback)But for 802.1x, I'll probably have to live without it, for now. (or get AEBS, which supports 802.1x and was very reliable from previous setups)

Although the keys don't stick, if you are not within line-of-sight of the receiver, any and all keys appear to stick. I even resorted to using an external USB power supply but it was no help. I am laying 3 feet from the computer, but if I let the keyboard fall below line-of-sight with the receiver it begins to fail badly... The touchpad is not functional and keys appear to stick or just don't respond at all.I believe I read something about a 30 meter range. That is one serious lie. I am bedridden so the features that this KB offered sounded perfect for me. It actually would be perfect IF it worked.

For my needs, the bass is fine, even impressive in the small hotel rooms I often frequent.  The only minus is the size and weight of the plug in, feels heavier than the unit.  Overall, absolutely wonderful speakers, esp. for its size, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for travel and/or dorm type speakers!!

$REVIEW.: This thing is solid. Was overkill for my 5lb acer 6510bd. Second the remarks on grommet being unusable. I'd further add that the install encourages you (rightly) to run cables down the pipe/center hole, thereby making the second cord hole useless. Just mounted that to front and not a big deal. Perhaps there's a scenario where you'd not want to use the pipe. It is nice and neat using the pipe though.

I can record more channels at once than I could with satellite plus I have more HD channels with Cable.I took a few calls to get the cable card working correctly with Charter but had no problems after the first night with either the cable card or the tuning adapter.I've had everything running a month now and I still love it.  I have no regrets with this purchase at all!

$review_text.: I own this unit for about 6 weeks now, and so far it works pretty good. From my experience so far I would recommend it - here is some (hopefully) relevant info about this clock/camera:- unit is small, but feels pretty sturdy and well-crafted- I leave it plugged into an outlet - the rechargeable battery alone lasts 4 hours when recording (according to the seller), and about a day without recording (according to me)- get a USB extension cable - the USB cord supplied does not reach an outlet close to the ground if the clock is on a table. I used a male-female USB extension.- video resolution can be set to 640 x 480; out of the box it was 320 x 240- video settings (resolution, video quality, night mode, etc) can be changed when you are in recording mode, and go to &lt;monitor settings> using the volume forward or reverse buttons (thanks to Inspector Gadget for mentioning this in his review!)- out of the box, night vision is weak - can be improved by going into &lt;monitor settings> and set &lt;DV night mode> to "on"; it was "off" out of the box, even though it still had some IR recording capabilities (? - not sure why) - anyway, with &lt;DV night mode> on, you get an OK-ish quality 6-7 feet range in a completely dark room- Mini SD card that comes with the package deal is a class 4 card- out of the box it records 30 min clips, each clip is approx. 30-50 MB in size (for 320x240) or 200-300MB (for 640x480 in high quality) - so for an overnight recording, you would find 20+ clips, each 30 min long, in the morning (video clip length can be changed in &lt;monitor settings> to either 10min, 30min, or 1hr)- this also implies that you get about 15 days of continuous recording on a 16GB card on the lowest 320x240 setting; on the better 640x480 setting, your 16GB card is filled up after about 3 days.- MAC users: this unit gives me a weird problem: when I connect it directly via USB, it keeps mounting multiple desktop icons (and by that I mean many, i.e. >10, and just keeps going). Somewhat annoying, so I just pop out the SD card, put it into an adapter and put that in my iMac. Takes 5 seconds and works nicely. Anybody else encountered this issue, with either Mac or PC?- MAC users: there might be a difference between playing videos in QuickTime Player versus other players (VLC, MPlayerX etc) in regards to sound (make sure sound is "on" in &lt;monitor settings>)

There was a hair of sag on the product after installation. Nothing made the sound of yielding, just a gentle sag. The television installed weighed in at a hefty 160lbs. Just to be on the safe side I engineered a re-enforcement to take load of the hinges that were sagging.Bracket otherwise looks great. Put the TV in a spot that is wonderful.Thanks again.

$REVIEW.: I wanted to not like these speakers being that they are only 2.1, are marketed as being for MP3 players despite being non-portable, and because I recently picked up a set of 5.1 speakers for slightly more money.  But despite all that, I love these speakers.  They are absolutely fantastic.For their small stature, the speakers that accompany the subwoofer are giants with respect to the sound that they can put out.  It's both clear and powerful.  I am very impressed.  And the subwoofer is equally impressive because it is also smaller than a typical subwoofer and yet still has tremendous power.  You wouldn't think so from the appearance or even the specifications.  These speakers must be experienced in order to understand how impressive they actually are.As far as value goes, for slightly more money, you can get yourself a 5.1 set from Creative or Logitech that sound fine.  But if all you want is something to blast music from your computer or MP3 player, I would absolutely recommend these bad boys.  I would even wager that they can compete with Bose Acoustimass speakers if you consider that they cost far less.Let's talk design.  The speakers are aesthetically pleasing.  They're classy looking.  Even the subwoofer looks well built.  Obviously the internals of these speakers are well designed or they wouldn't sound as well as they do.  So, really, the only thing I can criticize is the way they power on and off.  You must use a switch on the sub to turn them on and off.  A better design probably would have been to use the volume control.  But this is hardly a game changer.  Everything else about these speakers is perfectly fine to absolutely exceptional.One has to wonder why only $50 for such exceptional speakers.  I'm guessing it's because they are proprietary.  The two satellite speakers are hard wired together with a plug that goes from the control speaker to the subwoofer.  So, while satisfactory, there is limited distance by which to separate the speakers.  Also, the only input is a hard wired stereo jack -- no digital audio via optical or anything like that.  No RCA cables without an adapter.  Just the stereo jack.  So, the usage is rather limited to a specific set -- computer and mp3 player.  But that is not necessarily a bad thing.  It just makes it easier to manufacture as well as adding a limited amount of portability.  It wouldn't be too difficult to bring these speakers from one room to another rather quickly.I tested these speakers on my ipod and ipod shuffle.  Because you must use a stereo jack to plug the ipod in, it means you have 2 volume controls -- the ipod and the speakers themselves.  With other speaker setups that use a stereo jack, I have heard the scratchiness that's associated with over-modulation.  You may have experienced this if you've ever had to lower your ipod volume in order to prevent it in whatever setup you were using.  But with these speakers, you can turn your ipod volume all the way up and just rely on the volume controls on the speakers.  There's no modulation involved -- just amplification, which is a very good thing.  So, again, this product passes the test brilliantly.So, with all that in mind, I would absolutely recommend these.  It was easy to give this product 5 stars.

It was not worth fixing that, so I researched various replacements - a new 10&#34;, or a 7&#34; ..

I already have a Samsung Galaxy S3, so the 7&#34; seemed hardly worth the $ for the extra real estate

$REVIEW.: If you spend some time reading AVSForums you'll learn that last years model (the 3310) was plagued with dead networking cards.  It appears that nothing has changed with there year's model.  I ordered the 3311 from 6th Ave and they were quick to ship with a good price but after hooking it up I realized my network card was busted.  The unit will hang in the "Network Connecting" screen and never acquire an IP address or permit you to manually change any of the network settings.  Again, searching thru AVSForums I learned that this was a common problem on the 3310 and a few folks have had this with the 3311.  Since the networking features are the primary reason to step up to the 3311 from the 2311, this is a deal breaker.  I contacted 6th Ave and so far they have been great about the return.I'm on the fence on whether to try another Denon or try a Pioneer.  After my issues, I read up and realized that the Denons have a serious issue with reliability in terms of the network card.  Sure they offer a 3 year warranty, but you'll be without your receiver for weeks and have to pay to ship something that weighs 40lbs across the USA.  I have the 2310 now, and it's been a reliable receiver but I needed to upgrade to get 3D support.  I upgraded one model to get Pandora support and what I thought was digital source support for Zone 2.  After having the unit I now discover that Zone2 digital source support only means via Optical/Coax and not HDMI.  I can't believe that HDMI sources are still not supported for Zone 2.  I like to use Zone 2 to play my outdoor speakers and I refuse to run analog cables to all my sources for this.  It's just absurd that a receiver of this caliber with all the HDMI features you can imagine has left this out.Pros:- Video switching is good (no better or worse than last years model)- 3D pass thru from DirecTV to Panasonic VT25 works fine. (this would not work on the 2310 and DirecTV would fail to tune the 3D channels because if it)- HD Radio is nice, this was my first experience with HD radio and it truly is great stuff.  All the FM radio stations around me have HD support of it's great qualityCons:- Broken Network kills much of the things I bought it for.  How a $1300 receiver can ship with such crappy quality control amazes me.- Lack of Zone2/3 audio support from HDMI inputs.  This kills me.- Interface and manual still suck (IMO).  I think you realize more how bad it is when you have a defective unit and there's no useful troubleshooting.  No customer service support on the weekends either.- Charging $50 for Airplay support is pathetic, they should provide this firmware update for free.Still on the fence, since this receiver is one of the few I can find that does what I want.  I may end up trying another one but now I'm concerned about the reliability and just annoyed with Denon's poor quality control in regards to these networked receivers.

I ordered them on Friday after reading multiple reviews and seeing the continuous great ratings. I just got them in and they sound AMAZING. My music sounds fuller than it ever has, without being too overpowering. I used to use Apple buds or other bud style headphones and these are worlds better than those. I originally contemplated purchasing Beats Solo HD headphones, but I'd rather not spend $200 on a pair of headphones I'm only using on my MacBook Pro for iTunes and to watch movies.

Unfortunately it doesn't look like the picture


It has a cheesy polished silver trim around it that really looks crappy (I'll get over it)
The picture also seems to show an outside compartment which mine does not have


Per other reviews, the wheels are probably useless if you transport any weight at all, they will most likely fall apart
I'll replace them with quality wheels right away.I have a similar case that is heavy duty (made by a top name)  that carries 5 Speedotron moonlights -- this case probably couldn't handle the weight of three, so I'll use it for carrying lighter accessories.In conclusion, if you need a light duty case that's cheap, this will do the trick - just don't expect to much from it.

$review_text.: My wife and I have a small child and we are always afraid to wake him up by watching TV at night. It's great to be able to put these on and each set the volume to our liking (we got the extra set of headphones along with the base station) and know that we won't wake him up.The range seems great. I can use them all over my house while getting up to go to the kitchen for a snack during a movie or to the bathroom and still hear everything. Battery life is also good, I've used them on and off for a few days without recharging and had no issues. The only thing is that you can only charge one at a time, so if you have two like we do, make sure you alternate which one you are charging so you don't end up with a dead pair when you want to watch something.Tuning them in can be an issue, and there is almost always a very faint hissing sound, but when you are actually watching a movie or playing a game, you don't notice it. I have tons of wireless stuff in my house with phones, routers, other wireless devices, etc and haven't had any exceptional problems with interference. The hissing isn't loud enough to be a distraction to me or my wife, but audiophiles or picky listeners may find it more distracting than we do.One thing to be aware of is that a lot of newer TVs and even home theaters do not have headphone jacks anymore. I plug the headphones into my Mac Mini computer which we have hooked up to the TV as a media center, but I can't plug them directly into our TV or into our Sony "Soundbar" speaker system, as neither one of them have headphone jacks or RCA Audio Out (the red and white connectors). So, make sure they'll actually work for you with your setup. If you only have optical audio out on your home theater system or TV, you may have to find headphones that support that type of connection, and they are quite a bit more expensive.Setup is as easy as plugging the base up to the power outlet and into your audio source. You may have to adjust the tuning knob to get a good signal as well. Like I said it can take some fine-tuning to get it just right, but after I had it setup I haven't had to mess with it since.The headphones are very comfortable for my wife and I both. I've worn them for some marathon gaming sessions and never found them to be uncomfortable.I'd recommend these headphones to anyone looking for some wireless headphones. I think they are a reasonable price and good quality for the money.

$REVIEW.: The converter I got as of the time of this review was unbranded in a plain brown box, and a different model than pictured. It is about the same size, but is in a white and black plastic case that might break if accidentally stepped on, and not a black metal case. The audio output is a 3.5 mm stereo jack instead of the separate left and right RCA jacks. The unit did come with the necessary 5V DC universal (110v/220vac) adapter, and a small instruction booklet. I tested it with a Raspberry Pi (which I needed it for in the first place) and a Sony Blu-Ray player as sources, and with two different VGA monitors.The device seems to do its job very well, and translates the capabilities of the analog VGA output device to the HDMI capabilities advertised to the HDMI source. For example when connecting its VGA output to an old 1280x1024 4:3 monitor the device told the HDMI source to send 720p content. When the VGA output was hooked up to a 1920x1080 16:9 device, it requested 1080p. It appears to do this dynamically without having to turn off the power. When playing 16:9 content on an old 4:3 monitor the image is compressed horizontally to fit the narrow screen. The device must be HDCP capable because I've played commercial Blu-Ray disks through it with no problems.The picture quality of the analog VGA out is as expected: not quite as sharp and vibrant as a direct digital HDMI connection, but it is acceptable. The stereo sound is fine. When the supplied DC adapter is disconnected, the sound continues to work, but the output video signal disappears. I wouldn't count on it working from the power provided by an HDMI source.It does exactly what I expected it to do very well, so I'm giving it 5 stars.
$SUMMARY.: Does its job well, but different from picture

$REVIEW.: The folio met all my expectations: easy access to control, camera lens, earphone and charging receptacles without removing the case. The leather case feels good, closes with velcro so that it stays closed and there is a storage pocket. My goal was to protect the screen and avoid dropping my Ipod. This case does the job very well. Last, but certainly not least,  the case is quite attractive for both males and females. The color is black with royal blue stitching and lining. This is an excellent purchase that exceeded my expectations.

$review_text.: The ISY994 is an amazing box. It uses a Java-based interface which can be web-launched or more securely, downloaded as an app and run on any Mac or PC that supports Java. This makes the interface truly universal and this means that user communities can talk about programming the ISY rather than this version, that version or some other version of the user interface. Support form the manufacturer is fantastic. The help forums are lively places to learn abou the ISY and to pick up and trade configuration tips.You will need an Insteon PLM (modem) to interface this to your house. Once plugged in, you can begin adding Insteon devices. There is an add-on plugin which allows legacy X10 devices to be added and used as easily as Insteon devices. As of this writing, software has been updated to allow for much faster and easier addition of devices and a new version of the software is in beta.I have one of these set to act as a load controller, turning off a number of appliances during peak price hours and making sure they stay off. If one is activated by someone, within seconds, the system turns it off. My ISY is also connected to my home alarm system and can send me a TXT message if the system is tripped. It can also warn me of water leaks via email and TXT using battery powered water sensors.The Mobilinc app for iPhone/Ipad is the best $20 software purchase I have ever made. It connects me to my ISY controller and lets my phone become my remote control for the whole house. It works from anywhere so I can monitor my house while away.The ISY can be as simple or as complex as one's own imagination. It's a great platform for developing home control solutions and for having a whole lot of fun in the process.

$REVIEW.: I am forutnate enough to not only own this gizmo, but to also have the Mino Flip. ( Very similar to this but different brand). This review will be a comparason of the two.Vado comes with a soft silicone cover that is designed to wrap around the camera's impliments. Mino does not come with such a cover but does have a microfiber chinch tight sleeve.Both use a sandard USB port to upload/battery charge. However the Vado is very poorly placed and the flexible nature of the cord makes it very awkward. The Mino's connection pops out and remains ridgid, enabling a more stable connection to the USP port.The screen sizes are about equal. The funcitons and buttons are also quite comperable. Mino HD comes with just one record quality option for an hour; while Vado will record as high as HD+ for 2 hours or as low as VGA for 8hrs. I have not yet needed a full 2 hrs to test if this is true.For both products, uploading to your computer and viewing on a TV screen is fairly simply. The Mino comes with the colord three progned cord/plug ( dont remember what it is called) that goes into the standard ports in the back of your TV. The Vado comes with a USP type adapter that goes into an HDTV port. (slightly less bulkey then the Mino's method)Vado and Mino are equal in size and weight. Both are a blast. Everyone thinks you just have a measely little cell phone and are quite impressed to learn you have an HD video camera. It is great fun for gatherings. Hope this helps you choose.

I followed the instructions for first time charging and discharging in order to properly acclimate to the charging cycles


It only lasts about 2-3 hours maximum per charge


So, I'm not sure what happened, but I don't use my laptop without a nearby power source because I can't trust this battery

$review_text.: I purchased this case a little over a month ago to put together a gaming rig with a 2 slot GPU, and I have not been disappointed at all.The case is a solid build; none of the parts feel flimsy or cheaply made. It is on the heavier side, so keep that in mind as you start to put parts on it. However, it has a carrying handle for easier carrying which has made transporting it during a move very, very easy. This handle has a nice rubber grip to surround it to make holding it comfortable.It has multiple mesh openings to allow versatility when deciding how you would prefer to direct airflow in fan setups, including the ability to setup an exclusive side-to-side flow for a set of storage drive cages located in the front should you employ a multi-drive and/or RAID setup. These cages may also be rotated to allow a front to back airflow.The case does support up to an XL-ATX motherboard for your multi-gpu needs, and provides ample space to accomplish this with excellent airflow.Located along the side are multiple openings to allow routing of cables around the case to improve airflow should you take the extra time to properly route your cables. This process was very easy for me with the great number of openings the case provides, and afforded me a lot of extra room to let my fans push more air where it needed to go.Conveniently located on the top at a comfortable angle are the power and reset buttons, 4 USB ports, esata port, headphone + mic jacks, indicator lights, and buttons to control the RPM of the case fans. I enjoy the position of these buttons a great deal as they're a lot easier to access than just your standard forward facing buttons. Right below this is an "x-dock" to quickly plug in a 2.5" sata drive. I could have easily stuck my Samsung SSD in there, however, I preferred to screw it into the case so it would take advantage of the fans.I have a couple of miscellaneous items to share about this case that are more interesting tidbits than major details:The case comes with 4 stock fans (200mm top, 2x120mm front, 140mm rear) that employ nice red LED lights. I am sharing this computer with my gf, and we both decided we desired fans with blue LED lights. It was a very simple process to unscrew all of the case fans to replace them, however, do note that in order to achieve a front to back airflow you must unmount the fans on the side of the storage drive cages, unscrew the cages, rotate them, then put the fans back on. This really isn't that big of a deal, but the thumbscrews holding in the cages were very tight and required a screwdriver to remove despite appearing to be thumbscrews. I am not sure if these screws are always that tight in every one of these cases that is made.Also, there is an interesting small storage box that comes in the case, hidden just behind the silver logo at the bottom. Pop that bottom logo panel right out, and you'll expose the box that came pre-screwed into the case for security. There were some items and screws inside for the case, however I did see a review video that suggested one could employ it as a secret storage unit for important items or to store your valuables should you take this case to a LAN event. I do not take credit for this idea.In conclusion, overall I believe this is an excellent case for any gamer or performance user looking to put a lot of great parts into it. It's big enough to support a large enough motherboard to install multiple GPUs, and afford you enough room to cable route and open up room for improved airflow to cool all of your parts. As a reference, I monitor the temperatures of my parts at least once every use, and no part has gone above 30 degrees celsius at idle, and at load my GPU has not exceeded 60 degrees celsius even while running graphics intensive games such as Skyrim with texture mods and Battlefield 3. All of my games are played at 2560x1440 with maxed settings and generally stable frame rates (I have not tried overclocking yet.) For those who need extra storage, there are ample spots available to mount SSDs, and HDDs, as well as a separate cage for a group of 2.5" drives at the bottom of the case.I highly recommend this case as an option that you should compare amongst your other choices when researching what case to buy should you be interested in strong gaming or high performance setups.If you are a general user looking to browse the net, watch videos or streaming, and type documents, or you're just into light gaming without the frills, you're better off saving some money and going for a cheaper case that's smaller and is better suited to your needs. That doesn't mean to say this case will not serve your purposes, it just might be above what you need especially if budget is more of a priority than anything else.For reference, here are my specs:Gigabyte Z87X-UD4H moboIntel i7 4770k 3.5GhzCoolermaster Hyper 212 EvoGigabyte GeForce GTX 770 4GBCorsair Vengeance 2x4GB (8gb) 1600mhz 9-9-9-24Samsung 840 PRO 256gb SSD(primary)Seagate barracuda 500gb 5400rpm HDD (data storage)Western Digital 1gb HDD (data storage)Samsung 24x DVD driveCorsair HX750Coolermaster Storm Trooper

$review_text.: I needed a mouse to use on my laptop for gaming.  The cordless mouse that came with it just didn't cut it (couldn't transmit fast enough to keep up).  I looked online but couldn't decide so I went down to my local computer superstore.  I spent a considerable amount of time testing the feel of the mice and I ended up with this one.  I went into the store thinking I was going to get the 5 button Logitec MX300 but I walked out with this one (after paying, of course).Why go with the less expensive mouse?  Comfort.  I was willing to pay up to twice what I paid for this one but once I had this one in my hand I knew it was the right one.  The rubber grips on the side and the buttons are very comfortable.  The ridged wheel rolls with just the right effort and has nice positive clicks when spun.  The shape fits perfectly into my hand - I never have to arch my palm to perform any function (like using the scroll wheel).  I just rest my hand on the mouse naturally.  The resolution is 800 dpi so it's very sensitive.  The included software has many nice feature for mapping button presses (for example, left and right together) or key + button press (alt-left click, e.g.) to different functions.The mouse feels sturdy, the cord is long, and it comes with a PS/2 adapter if you don't want to use a USB port.  I'm very happy with it.  Great design + good software + low price = excellent value.

$REVIEW.: It's day one with the Q1M earbuds manufactured by JLab Audio/Boqari. So far they are impressive, at least compared to the less-than-average earbuds that were included with my Sony Walkman. I like how the pack included a bag of earbud tips of different sizes and types, hopefully it will provide most people with a proper fit. I got them strait off JLab Audio's main website on sale for $60, although they're also available on Boqari's main website as well as Amazon.I'm currently enjoying them right this second; they bring out more sounds than any other earbuds that I've ever used in my life, no joke. Of course I'm only 19, so I haven't had a long time on this Earth to compare. I heard in one review that the bass on the Q1Ms seems to boom, which I agree with. Though I have also read that a lot of people aren't impressed by the bass. Certain factors may affect the bass, such as the equalizer settings that a person is using on their music player. In a video review, the guy said that these earbuds have a break-in period of 40-50 hours. He meant that for the Q1Ms to be used to their full potential, they must be used for a while, kind of like shoes. I'm not sure how accurate that statement is though; if they start to sound better than they already do as I use them more, I will like them even more. Only time will tell.The design is very solid and stylish, although I bought them for sound quality, not style; I guess I got two in one. One of the other good things about the Q1M earbud set is that you also get a free lifetime warranty, though you must register your product's serial number within 30 days of purchase on boqari.com for the warranty to activate. I'm not trying to be biased, so if you buy them or not that's your choice. There's still a lot of other brands out there to compare and contrast.

$review_text.: I have a full-sized rig in my living room and wanted a smaller one for the bedroom. I needed a mini-PCIE slot on the motherboard for wifi and a Z77 chipset to take full advantage of the i7-3770K I got so cheap at MC. The highly rated Asus Deluxe mITX board was out of my price range so I was left to choose between Gigabyte and ASROCK. I had been at the same decision point for my full-sized rig and I first went with Gigabyte since I hadn't heard of ASROCK at that time. However the POST time was unacceptable so I ended up going with ASROCK for that computer. When I noticed a free RAM promotion at the Egg for the mITX ASROCK board, I jumped on it, though I would still have bought it at the asking price if I had to.Pros:1. mSATA slot on the underside. When I bought the board this was one of the main selling points because I could use the mSATA to hold a 256GB SSD as primary and free up space in the rest of the case for better airflow. However I didn't end up using it later because I was concerned about air-flow and heat down there. In hindsight, now that I have my case fully crammed, I think I might have been better served with a 64GB mSATA for intel RST (gives SSD-like performance without actually using the SSD as a drive) and just having another 2.5 HDD for data. It would have freed up a lot more space inside my tiny case. One minor caveat here is that the mSATA slot is SATA2 even if you have a SATA3 drive (unlike the newer ASROCK boards for Haswell that have SATA3 mSATA slots).2. 8-pin CPU connector on the ASROCK versus 4-pin CPU connector on the Gigabyte. 4-pin is rated up to 150W and the 3770K can hit 160W at max load without overclocking (overclocked it can hit 250W). This is something I noticed post-purchase, so it was a good think I went with this board.3. 4 USB3 ports on the ASROCK versus 2 USB3 ports on the Gigabyte board. It can support another 2 USB3 and 4 USB2 ports via headers.4. It has an eSATA port which I will never use.5. I needed the mini-PCIE slot for a wifi card and this was one of the few boards that has it. It already has a good quality Realtek wifi module, which is supposed to be better than the Broadcom module that most other motherboard manufacturers bundle with theirs. However it does not support 5GHz which I needed to fend off heavy interference at 2.4GHz in my highrise building. So I bought an Intel 6235 dual-band wifi + Bluetooth cardIntel Network 6235AN.HMWWB Centrino WiFi Card Advanced-N 6235 Dual Band Bluetooth Retailand Antenna that support 5GHzProtronix 2dBi RP-SMA Antenna for Wireless PCI Card or Router. I thought the 2.4GHz antenna that was included with the board was too ugly to use anyway.6. It comes with many extras like 2 SATA3 cables, an ugly but functional antenna, DVI-VGA adapter and a multimedia suite which I hear is pretty good but I've never tried. ASROCK also has a free overclocking utility that you can use in Windows for rather easy overclocking without messing around in the BIOS.7. POSTS very quickly, even quicker than my Z77 Extreme4.Cons:1. I'm using a Thermalright AXP-100 cooler. The backplate make contact with the side of the mSATA slot causing some tension. The bracket for the cooler at the top makes contact with the capacitors that are lined up alongside the CPU. I was very fearful of causing damage while tightened everything down but luckily it turned out just fine. I could have used washers to add some clearance but I did not want to risk insufficient thermal contact with the CPU.2. Antenna wires run all the way from the mini-PCIE card to the back of the antenna connectors on the back. Seems too fragile. They could have soldered these to the board closer to the mini-PCIE slot.My build:Silverstone Tek Plastic/SECC Mini-ITX Computer Case with 2x USB 3.0 Front Ports SFF Cases, Black SG05BB-LITESilverstone ST45SF 450 watts SFX form factor power supplyAS Rock LGA1155 DDR3 SATA3 USB3.0 A GbE Mini-ITX Motherboard Z77E-ITXIntel Core i7-3770K Quad-Core Processor 3.5 GHz 8 MB Cache LGA 1155 - BX80637I73770KThermalright AXP-100 (Designed for ITX and HTPC Systems.)Crucial Ballistix Sport Very Low Profile 16GB Kit (8GBx2) DDR3-1600 1.35V UDIMM 240-Pin Memory Modules BLS2C8G3D1609ES2LX0EVGA GeForce GTX670 FTW 2048MB GDDR5 256bit, Dual Dual-Link DVI, HDMI, DisplayPort, 4-Way SLI Ready Graphics Card Graphics Cards 02G-P4-2678-KRToshiba TS-L633 8x DVDRW DL Notebook SATA Drive (Black)SanDisk Extreme SSD 240 GB SATA 6.0 Gb-s 2.5-Inch Solid State Drive SDSSDX-240G-G25Seagate Barracuda 3 TB HDD SATA 6 Gb/s NCQ 64MB Cache 7200 RPM 3.5-Inch Internal Bare Drive ST3000DM001StarTech.com Slimline SATA to SATA Adapter with Power(SLSATAADAP)Intel Network 6235AN.HMWWB Centrino WiFi Card Advanced-N 6235 Dual Band Bluetooth RetailProtronix 2dBi RP-SMA Antenna for Wireless PCI Card or Router

$review_text.: The bag is great...I am not sure what all the fuss was about the handle, but it works fine for me...the bag is plenty big for my macbook pro contained in an Incase (the Incase's by the way are very nice!!!)  It has plenty of compartments and spaces for just about everything I need to carry around with me including a camera, daytimers, cords, pens, pads of paper, folders, etc

 It is a heavy duty canvas with a one year warranty...the clips are built to last and overall, once you get it all on your shoulder, it rides comfortably
 I love the looks of it...simple, functional, and not ostentatious like some bags i see out there
 In short, for the money, you can not go wrong

 It is not great on padding, so I would highly recommend a sleeve for your laptop...and as I said, the Incase is awesome
 I looked long and hard for a bag and the reviews on this one were solid...and I am here to say that the reviews are reliable
 MY only  con is that I wish that the strap holding everything in was velcro and not a button snap...hard to snap it closed...but a minor thing, which is probably not all that necessary anyway- the clips on the outside of the bag pretty much hold it all together.

$REVIEW.: I needed a mouse for a new laptop that had the silly glide pad on it.  While that is better than the ridiculous eraser knob it's still lousy at best.  Nothing beats a real mouse and until we all have a Jarvis system like in IronMan and can lose all this silly interface garbage -- but I digress.In my career, I have used all sorts of track balls, Kinect like things and more, but for now a good keyboard and mouse is hard to replace.I prefer the Microsoft mice, but since I am bound by strict rules of frugality, I look for a good value, or something cheap.  I read the various reviews for other cheap mice and it seemed like either the issues were too light, too small, or too loud clicking action.This mouse is decently sized, a little on the light side, and has average sounding clicks.  My hand is not small but I am not looking for some monstrosity mouse either so it feels fine.  Under Windows 7, it works great with no issues.  It has been about two months and it still works fine.  The wheel is decent too.I have better mice at work, but this one is fine for home use which meets frugal standards.  4.5 overall.

$REVIEW.: Let me state for the record that I've owned multiple tablets and found issues with every tablet.  Among those tablets were each generation of the larger iPads and even though those tablets kept managed to shed some weight they were still uncomfortable and awkward to hold.  Honestly, they caused me major neck strain and then my wallet started to hurt when I had to make multiple visits to the Chiropractor.So, this brings me to the iPad Mini which, should have been the answer to my problems with the larger iPads.  I'm not going to lie, it did correct the problems with the weight and size issues that much is true but, please allow me to explain the title with more detail below.PERFORMANCEThis is about on par with the iPad 2 or iPad 3 and that's really not surprising given the fact that internals are pretty much Identical to the 2nd Generation iPad 2 in a smaller package.  Overall, it is still pretty fluent and is more than capable of running some good graphics.BATTERY LIFEWell, this is a tough situation because the battery can go 10 hours in a perfect setting but, it can actually be as low as 6 hours under slightly compromising to severe conditions.  This will be explained a little more as we go on but for now, it is about an average performer in this area.CAMERASThe Front Facing Camera is a typical 1.3 MP Camera that pretty much is only used for Video Chat.  It isn't going to win any awards and is about on par with other tablets.The rear facing camera is pretty good but, not going to replace your point and shoot cameras and certainly isn't going to replace your DSLR cameras.  Overall, this is the one major upgrade from the iPad 2 as this camera is significantly better and is the same camera that was in the 3rd Gen iPad.BUILD QUALITYThe build quality is top notch and it is very tight overall.  The finish on the rear is nice and it appears to be pretty resistant to minor falls but, you'll need a case because the finish can scratch very easily.  Still, the build quality is the best part of the Tablet and it is top notch.SCREENOkay, In the larger iPad models, the screen has always been what set it apart from most of the competition.  With the iPad Mini, Apple shrank the screen and figured the increase in resolution would be enough to carry this over to the smaller model...  They were wrong!The display on the iPad Mini has actually been tested and it is one of the worst on a small tablet to hit the market!  I can vouch for this as the reflectance requires you to crank the brightness in well-lit rooms or it is unusable!  On top of that, reading on the tablet leaves the fonts edges smeared and the places where there should be spaces often run together (this makes cl look like a d at times).The power consumption is another issue because, cranking the brightness literally takes 40% of the batter life on any given day!  These are the circumstances where you only get about 6 hours of battery life.Amazon removed my link so I would encourage you to search John Gruber (John's wife says Eww about the display), Zach Epstein, CNET (CNET says to pass on the iPad Mini if you want it for reading, where have I heard that before), and Displaymate (Displaymate shows the reflectance issues, mentions competitions screens being noticeably sharper, and the covers the power issues)  for their views on the screen, I am not the only person who feels this way about the iPad Mini screen.  Marques Brownlee on youtube also compared the Nexus 7 and the iPad Mini and he came to a similar conclusion as well.CONCLUSSIONIf you really want this tablet, look for some type of screen protector that will reduce glare because it really is that bad.  If you're just looking for a smaller tablet that you can use, I recommend the Google Nexus 7 or the Amazon Kindle HD 7" as the display, performance, and battery life will be far better on those tablets.  If you absolutely want an Apple iPad, grab the 4th Gen 9.7" Model as it is far superior to the Mini.I personally went with the Nexus 7 and I'll be returning my iPad Mini in short order as it is a highly disappointing product.

$REVIEW.: I'm new to GPS devices so I asked around and was recommended to the Garmin line
 I bought my son and myself the Garmin Nuvi 650 and we are both very happy with it (found them online at a box warehouse for $299 each, delivered with tax and shipping for around $325 each)

 Took the unit out of the box, battery had plenty of juice in it to play around with it for a while
 You just turn it on, and in less than 1 minute we were ready to go


 It reads in the satellites and you set your home location and that was it


 Very impressive, as it knows to the foot exactly where you are, announces streets just before you get to them, and if you take a different route than recommended, it just recalculates in seconds

 It even shows train tracks coming up on the screen, and next thing you know you went right over those tracks
 As your driving around it shows parks on the screen, golf courses, etc


so that was kind of nice

 NO CD or other software to load


 In fact there was no CD in the box

 Found a nice leather case for it at Best Buy for $19

 Now all we need is an inexpensive carrying bag from Target


 I did notice that the database has a few outdated restaurants and such, but that's understandable considering how much developments change, restaurants move or close, etc
 Some newer shopping centers I couldn't find though they  have been under construction for over a year and we have the 2008 maps
 The 4.3" screen on this thing is gorgeous and the voice announcing the streets is pleasant

 We're both extremely happy with this Nuvi 650


 However for the price it should have included a case and at least an AC charger

 You have to charge from the USB of your PC or plug it into the cigarette lighter adapter in your car
 A permanent screen protector would have been nice too, since they put one on there that has to be removed and tossed
 Adding these omitted items will add at least $50 to have the complete setup


 I also bought the larger friction mount to use the UPS on the dash or floor, since they are illegal to mount on the windshield in California


 This works out really nice.

$review_text.: My S3100NX desktop is set up as dual-boot with Win XP and Ubuntu Linux 10.04.  My original drive was developing a pretty loud wine so I got a WD 160GB Sata Drive with a Syba SD-VIA-1A1E1S SATA PCI controller.  Unfortunately the Syba controller didn't seem to get along with my BIOS as it crippled my ability to boot from CD, so I sent it back.  The SATA controller BIOS had no options for fixing this as far as I could see.  So, I got this SATA to IDE converter instead.  I would have done this first, but I feared that my BIOS would not be able to break thru the 120GB barrier and I thought that a controller with its own BIOS would be the best course of action.  Anyway, I put in this converter instead and it wasn't a problem.  The computer addresses the full 160GB, Linux boots in 37 seconds instead of 60 seconds, Win XP is faster to boot also (save 30 secs), and I get a slot back.  Also, when I was trying to get the new PCI controller to work, I had another compatibility problem with XP not being able to boot the hard drive and I suspect it was because the supplied AHCI driver was just not working.  But with the SATA drive on the IDE controller, it works seamlessly without the need for an AHCI driver.  Summary:  If you want a SATA drive on an old Windows XP computer, this adapter is more compatible, works fine and costs less than a SATA controller.

$review_text.: I'll start by saying it's not really black


 It's more of a charcoal gray
 You would think that with the other one being called Khaki GREEN, black would be black


 That being said, I'm not disappointed at all!!  The charcoal gray as canvas looks super sexy

 The black accents make it look even sexier
 Super high quality, I can tell this is going to last forever
 It's well padded so I'm at ease knowing my stuff (Alienware M11x laptop + Pentax K-r DSLR, Pentax 50mm f/1.4 and Pentax 10-17mm Fisheye, + 1TB WD External HD) is well secured

 Even the straps are well padded and made from the same sexy gray canvas material with black adjustable strap accents.Pockets galore!  Pockets inside pockets, with pen holders inside of those!  2 hidden water bottle holders (I wouldn't use them for my tripod, as there's some nice straps on the bottom of the bag I use instead)! Hooks galore too!My only cons:- The black chrome, shiny metal rings on the bag kind of make it look like a fancy Coach purse or something, it looks too feminine even for me.- The interior material is an atrocious 90's-computer-gray color

 It doesn't go well with the charcoal and black and I hate that it sticks out sometimes on the top part

 I kind of wish it was black as well.- I don't like the Velcro "build-your-own" DSLR compartments part


 I wish the compartments were pre-sized, but I'm sure this might be a pro for those of you with more than 3 lenses.- I haven't field tested this bag yet, but I'm thinking the way it holds your DSLR isn't a very good way if you want to be able to access it quickly and safely


 You are forced to take the bag off your back entirely and lay it or hold it horizontal so that when you unzip it, your camera and accessories don't come falling out.All cons aside
 I'm keeping it


 And not just because it was a Father's day gift from my wife, but because I've always felt more comfortable traveling with a back pack than and satchel
 Especially when I had 2 satchels, one for my laptop and one for my camera

 This thing is super convenient


 And sexy.

$review_text.: This is the most ergonomically incorrect mouse I've ever used. After a few minutes of use, it really hurts my wrist, as it is too small for big hands and using the scrolling gestures is very difficult. That said, the mouse does not track accurately enough for detailed tasks: if you use Illustrator, for example, where having fine control over your mouse tracking is important, the Magic Mouse is incredibly frustrating.In my opinion, Apple makes great computers but has a horrible track record in making intuitive and quality mice, dating back to the hockey-puck circular mouse for the original iMac, to the wired Mighty Mouse released a few years go. This one is no exception to this long line of stinkers.I highly recommend using a more intuitive and ergonomically correct Logitech mouse. A quality Logitech mouse will cost less than this Magic Mouse.

$REVIEW.: I have a Focusrite Saffire that uses a firewire 400 cable, but my MacBook Pro only has a firewire 800 port. I have a firewire 400/800 cable that works, but the 800 port on MacBooks are bad for having a loose connection for a lot of firewire 800 plugs and the cable I'd been using would pop out once in a while.I bought this when I couldn't find the adapter recommended by Focusrite, and it works fine.  The 400 cable from my interface fits snugly in the adapter, and the 800 end of the adapter fits snugly in my MacBook Pro firewire 800 port. Previously I had a lot of problems with disconnects, but no more.The plug doesn't take up too much room from the other ports like some firewire adapters with way too big plugs.

$review_text.: The SATA ends of this cable are fine, but the Molex end is fairly difficult to use. The pins in the Molex style connector are not fixed in place firmly, so they wobble around, not staying straight as you try to plug the connector into the mating end from the power supply.All four pins have to stay straight enough to each mate with its mating socket as you mate the connector with the mating power supply connector. If even one of the pins is misaligned, it keeps the connector from mating. With perseverance and patience, I was able to mate the connectors on about the twelfth attempt. Frustrating, but works fine when you finally get the connection made.

$REVIEW.: I live about 40-50 miles from the transmission towers. I picked this antenna because I have an HOA and it needed to be installed outdoors discretely. This is a small antenna. I hooked it up to the existing cable tv line and installed it about 10 feet above the floor only halfway up the side of the house, in a hidden spot. Despite being a 2 story house and having a neighbor's tall wall block the direct line of the transmission, I still got all the major network channels clearly without any studdering. The majority of channels fell in the 80-90% strength with only 3 channels in the 60-70% strength (still excellent clarity). I was very pleasantly suprised, but it did take about 40 minutes of fine tuning with aiming the antenna. I almost decided to ditch it because I wasn't aiming it in an optimal way in the beginning and 2 important channels had sub 50% strength. Very pleased with this product. I would suggest a larger antenna if you can do it, but for those who need something very small, this is the ticket.

$REVIEW.: We've had this camera for about a month and a half...I've taken approximately 200 pics with it. Awesome is all I can say...I've been into photography for about 15 years. My film camera I spent $[money] on between body, lenses, and flash (a Nikon N70, 2 zoom lenses and a zoom flash). The Canon S30 takes just as good pictures and its easy enough to use that my wife can also use it.Downloading pics to the computer takes 1 or 2 seconds. I can take  a picture, download and post it to the internet in less than 4 minutes.Quality is outstanding. I love this camera. I still have film in my Nikon from my sons birth that I haven't taken out to get developed yet. And unlike my anal photo way that I am, it doesn't bother me because we have the Canon S30.One other great feature I was able to use while taking pics at the hospital, was the black and white feature. Just turn the dial and take black and white pictures of a mother with her new baby.One last thing: upgrade to a bigger flash card, I found a 128MG card for $[money] and I also purchased a 2nd battery for $[money]. Both at other online stores...The battery doesn't take long to charge, but if your in the middle of photo taking it is nice to have an extra...

$review_text.: I'm someone born, ahem, not in the last two or three decades, so I've already been through the gamut of collecting great stereos and speakers in my life. I did not relish having to buy more, just so I could listen to Rhapsody on something other than my pitiful computer speakers, and only in my office. I didn't want to have to climb into the attic or the crawlspace to install wired speakers. I didn't want anything Bluetooth (like a Jawbone) because I subscribe to a music service online (Rhapsody) through my desktop computer and didn't want to be restricted to music I already owned, and my desktop computer doesn't have Bluetooth. I did a TON of research and this one seemed to be what we needed.It came quickly and with all the cords and plugs I needed. It also comes with pictogram instructions and an installation CD. I was skeptical on whether it would truly be all that easy to set up. It really is.We have a wireless router that the Bridge is plugged into (that came for free with the order of the Connect). Then we plugged the Connect into the AUX jack of my bookshelf stereo in another room and turned it on (an old Sony that has DVD player, CD player, tape player, and a single AUX jack that I plug into an old CRT TV in a spare room). The Connect then wirelessly speaks to the Bridge and receives the signal to broadcast anything I want. The only glitch we had was user error--we forgot to turn up the volume on the actual Connect box. Once we did that, we could listen to absolutely anything we wanted, through great speakers. We have iPhone 4's that we use the SONOS app to run the system. The app works best with the volume on it turned all the way up, and then we regulate the volume on the stereo with the remote for the stereo.Bottom line, I can now stand in my kitchen, open the SONOS app, and play anything on Rhapsody, completely on the other side of the house, through really great speakers. Exactly what I wanted!

$REVIEW.: I have been on a quest to find an on-ear headphone that can deliver good noise isolation, good noise leakage prevention and solid sound performance.  I have tried various active noise cancelling headphones such as the Bose QC15's and Sennheiser PXC 310 BT but I found the active noise cancelling created various issues that I did not like.  Much more research later I discovered various DJ style headphones that are well regarded in the hi-fi community world (I am NOT an audiophile) that supposedly deliver very good passive noise isolation and great sound.  So I began my journey into this area and started with the Sennheiser HD25-1 II which have been around for a long time.  I Loved the fit, sound and noise isolation, however, in my exprience, they leaked sound very badly.  I decided to give the TMA-1's a try next as I found that the earpiece was a little bit bigger than the HD25's so i was hoping that would help with my one issue left of sound leakage.Upon receiving my package I was blown away by the packaging.  Very nicely done but I was hoping that I wasn't paying for nice packaging.  When I took the cans out I loved the way these look.  Granted, I will look a bit funny with anything other than earbuds when riding on the train, I found that these offer a decent "not to strange" look.I threw these on my head and started playing my Ipod.  Before I get to the sound quality, here are my intial impressions on how they fit.1.  The headband is way looser than the HD-25's.  This results in less noise isolation yet, surpisingly, I get 100X better protection from noise leakage.  My wife had to stand right next to me to hear anything unlike the HD25's where she could hear them from across the room.2.  The headband again...it fits so loose that I was worried about them falling off.  After several hours of use, however, I have not had them fall off and I found them to be more comfortable than the HD25's due to the lower clamp force.3.  When I first put them on, the rubber headband kind of hurt the top of my head but after a few minutes, it seemded to soften and I barely noticed it.  I will be taking these on a 6 hour flight in a few days so I will have a great opportunity to try these out even more.On to sound..I loved the way the HD-25's sounded as I listen to mostly rock music.  The up front and punchy bass with little soundstage makes the HD-25's perfect for that.  The TMA-1's were so drastically different from the HD-25's that I have a hard time comparing them.  This is NOT a bad thing.  The sound is "darker" as others have stated but it can easily be addressed using normal EQ settings on an MP3 player.  The best way I can describe how these sound compared to the HD-25's is saying that the HD-25's sound like stereo and the TMA-1's sound like surround sound.I am chalking up my description as that the TMA-1's provide much better soundtsage.  These are much more laid back and provide very good instrument segregation.  At first I was not liking it as I was used to the up front, in your face sound of the HD-25's but after listening for a few hours, I had a huge smile on my face....these are very fun to listen to.  I was hearing things in music that either get drowned out in other headphones I own or just weren't being emphasized.  Also, these cans are LOUD.  They produce some of the loudest vlumes of any headphones I've used so I have found that I do not need a separate amplifier with them.I am kind of at a crossroads right now with my decisions on headphones.  The HD-25's and TMA-1's are so different from each other that it is almost worth keeping both.  I can say that if the HD-25's had better noise leakage, I would probably stick with those as they fit my style of music bettr.  However, the TMA-1's were very enjoyable to listen to.  The accuracy of the music may not be there (or what was intended by the artist) but it makes for cool listening.  And the noise leakage protection is top notch.I would have given the TMA-1's 5 stars but I decudted 1 star due to the headband being loose and the lower noise isolation I get with them.  Also, they don't fold up as nicely as other DJ style headphones making them a bit bulkier to travel with.Overall, a great headphone with a wonderful sound that put a smile on my face!

I have only had it for a few days, but the bag is rugged with strong zippers.  It comes with two handles, or you can use the shoulder strap.  There are extra pockets for pens, cash, credit cards, etc.  As a carrying case, it gets five stars.  As a workstation, I have to give it a four.  It is fine on a hard surface, but using my lap or the bed didn't work out well.  The case would tip and tilt, making it difficult to use the keyboard.

$review_text.: I just received this 2 speaker set today and hooked them up and I must say I was truly impressed. While not expecting a lot of bass to begin with they did a real good job handing just about any music type I threw at it. They were more than loud enough while filling the room with real good sounds. I never heard any distortion until I turned up the volume way past 75%. I really liked the AUX input and Headphone output. There is a separate on/off power knob and a tone control knob. I love not having to lower the volume fully to turn the speakers off. I was also expecting an AC adapter because it is needed to power these speakers. A USB powered hookup would not deliver enough power. These speakers have a total of 6w RMS (3w/Speaker). Every speaker system I was looking at over 3 watts total RMS had an AC Adapter. The only real negative thing was the super bright Blue LED power indicator. I quickly took care of that with some scotch tape. Because of their light weight I ended up using some Velcro and mounted these puppies to the wall over the monitor. In my opinion, if you want a lot of bass than go with a 2.1 system. I would highly recommend this system to anyone who was not expecting a lot of bass but just real good sounding music at any volume.

$review_text.: as my first digital camera it was amazing. id recommend it for anyone as a first camera. it lasted thru quite a few drops (i can be clumsy @ times), and took great pictures overall. i also used it to take pictures of pictures (my quick way of digitizing older 1980's & 90's printed pictures) and after a few tries i always got a clear shot. i also used at concerts and the zoom is surprisingly clear, as long as u steady the camera. the pros outweigh the cons in my opinion and the only reason im getting rid of it is cause im ready to upgrade. i gave it to another first-timer.pros:-clear colorful shots (incl. pictures of text, scenery, other pictures, etc)-lost of functions to play with-image editing from cameracons:-not good for dark lit places-when shooting multiple simultaneous shots it sometimes stalls-close-ups sometimes blurry-no sound when shooting video-flash is unusually bright

$REVIEW.: If you like a few different color LED lights this is for you.  If you want any real amplification of sound, this isn't the way to go.I tried this device on 2 different iPods and I honestly could not tell any difference with this plugged in line or not. If there is a difference it so imperceptible.  I was really hoping for this to work when on my (rather loud) motorcycle.  But forget that, it doesn't even raise the volume in a quiet room. Also the battery drains even when not in use.  I left it fully charged in a draw only to find it completely dead 3 days later.I saw some of the other posts stating the same thing, but I really wanted to believe  they just got a bad one.  Nope!

$REVIEW.: I received these as a gift from my Wife for boating

 They are really compact but the image is excellent in them


 I'm not a binocular person (apart from biologically speaking) but regularly work with cameras and I'm actually amazed at the detail that can be picked out at several miles range
 It makes the task of finding friends and meeting up with them on the lake much easier!Furthermore, they come in a nice soft case and have great lens caps that really keep the dirt out and protect well


 The rubberized exterior finish also gives me the confidence to let my kids play with/use them.

$review_text.: I bought it because it was really cheap and I wanted something, anything to protect my brand new iPad. It is a very simple rubber case, but it does fit nicely around the iPad. No, it's not going to give it much protection from falling or anything like that, but it does protect the back from scratches, etc. It's a little slippery to hold. Has a cutout for the Apple logo in back, and for all the ports of the iPad. I think it was worth buying.

$review_text.: I have never spent any time even thinking about headphones until my old set of Sony's broke recently.  After reading many reviews and doing much research I decided to purchase a set of the Sennheiser HD 595's.I am absolutely blown away by the quality of this equipment.  I am running them with a Rolls HA43 Pro Amp.  These headphones are incredible without the amp, however, with the amp the depth of the music increases by a multiple factor even at low levels.My previous set of headphones and my buddie's Aiwa headphones sound like you have cotton in your ears even running simultanously through the Rolls Amp.  No comparison.Crisp, clear sound at all volumes.  Many reviews indicate that you cannot listen to "open" headphones in a quiet office.  This is simply not true.  I work in an extremely quiet cube farm and my neighbors cannot hear these headphones when I listen to them at what I consider a high level.  I have very slight background sounds when some folks are on the telephone, but not noticeable enough to be distracting.The ergonomics of these are top shelf.  I love the way the felt pads fit completely over my ears and do not press the ears to my head.  Leather covered and I have a large head and these are simply the most comfortable headphones I have ever found that do not feel like they pinch me at all.I have run them through my computer, through my walkman and through an Ipod and every application created the most beautiful music experience I have ever had through headphones.Loud, LOUD - with the Rolls HA43 Pro Amp, I was running XM radio through them at night using an "8" setting on a scale of 10 to break them in or burn them in.  I had them in a sealed box downstairs in my office running all night and they woke my wife up at midnight upstairs and down the hall when a particularly rowdy song must have come on XM Radio during the night.  No distortion whatsoever at these high volumes.At low volumes the bass is just top notch - you can feel the thump at levels low enough that you can not even hear the music through the "open" backs.Do not short change yourself - buy an amp - it is worth every penny of $50 to have the sound that these will produce with one - seriously - standard headsets sound like you have cotton in your ears compared to what these will produce.A Headset Audiophile has been born - thank you Sennheiser.

$REVIEW.: Bought this because those little cubes won't fit in tight spots

The short pig-tail alows this to be plugged in to places those little cubes won't fit like a wall jack or the back of a printer.The jack on the back of my printer was in a little recess in the back so only the cable could be plugged in


In order to use a cube I had to use a short cable and a coupler which didn't look good and multiplied the number of connections.If I had gotten this in black instead of white it would have blended in better

But it works just fine regardless of color.

$REVIEW.: If you think photography will be an essential part of your life, don't hesitate in getting this tripod.  Of course it is very pricey but you get what you pay for.  Precise locking, stable and extremely well made.  Barring misuse and lack of care, this tripod should last a very long time.  For me the choice came down to the Gitzo 2541 or this one.  I chose this one because I will be not be going on really major hikes and I decided to sacrifice the weight for more stability and the ability to support a video camera if needed.  For some reason I thought I would second guess myself over the stability factor if I bought the 2541.  I did a ton of research and I am happy that I chose the 3541LS.  The LS also gives you good height, so your camera is at your eye level.  I use it with a Canon 5DII and Arca-Swiss Z1 ballhead.
$SUMMARY.: Some things are worth the price

$review_text.: I purchased these speakers for my PC to replace a 12 year old set of Dell speakers that I've been using.  I didn't realize just how bad the Dell speakers were until I plugged these in.  The highs are pitch perfect and crisp.  The bass doesn't shake the room, but it's definitely enough to bother someone in the adjacent room.  I have these plugged into a Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi making it easy to adjust the volume from a remote.  But they work great plugged directly into the speaker jack.The look of the speakers is modern and classy.  The cables/cords are red.  To some this may be annoying, but I like the contrast.Only beef with them is the ability to hang them on the wall (as the description says).  They come with no wall mounting hardware or screws.  I assume that you remove the rubber feet from the stands and search for screws that will fit through the holes for mounting.  I want mine on the wall, but I don't feel like going to the hardware store to get the right screws.  I know, lazy.All in all, a great purchase.PS.  Circuit City is slow to ship, so don't expect these to arrive in a couple of days.  It was more like 10 days from the date of purchase.

Like others have said, it might be a tad weak for your liking


Unlike the 561 where you could feel confident leaving your camera on unattendedly, you need to always kinda hold on to it; it won't stand on its own.The foot joint was a bit too damped for my taste, so I applied some silicone lubricant and it's now perfect.Note: do NOT use graphite lubricant


It'll stop the joint from moving altogether

I learned this the hard way.Knocked off 1 star for being slightly flimsy, giving the high price.

$REVIEW.: After I got my SX40 camera, I quickly purchased one of these batteries even though Canon told me that it could damage the camera (because it isn't a Canon battery at 5 times the price). Well, that one worked so well that two weeks ago, I ordered two more. One will stay in my bag, one in the car, and one in my pocket if only I could remember to bring it.The original proprietary Canon battery is 750Mah, and since I don't use video, I got about 350 shots per charge. Mind you that my camera is set for the highest resolution possible. This 1200Mah battery - the one I just received - has made it past 500 shots including some burst mode.I don't know how long the battery will keep its charge just sitting. With the weather we've been having this "winter," my camera has not been idle for a single day. I can say that three days is about average for shooting, and you never know what that low battery indicator is going to come up. (And on the SX40, when it comes up, you only have ... 20 shots left - not much warning. For $10, I just can't see why anyone wouldn't have a spare ... or three!EW

$review_text.: I just love my new webcam. The quality of the image is great. What I really loved is the feature it has with the illumination. It doesn't matter if you have direct or indirect light, the little camera adjust it automatically for you and everybody can see you clearly. The installation is very easy to follow and it upgrades the software for a better experience when installing it. I did not have any problem. I love the size, it is just perfect for when I travel especially because it also bring this cute little carrying case that protects it. Stick your camera and wires there and you are ready to go! I also liked the fact that it includes a little stand for when you don't want to clip your camera to your laptop. This is just an awesome addition because you can easily use it with a desktop too. Disadvantage? The camera is kind of expensive though, but it is better to invest in something good than buying something cheap then regret it because you will eventually end up buying something else, besides Amazon has a better price than if you want to buy it from Logitech's site, almost a 100 bucks, so you better buy it here.

$REVIEW.: When used with a 34xx/54xx/58xx Adaptec SATA RAID controller, this model of drive may disappear from the system and go offline.  Consistent testing shows this western digital wdc drive will fail and the problem can be replicated at will, however, installing older WDC models (RE3, RE2, RE drives) will not fail, so seems to be an issue with the new RE4 firmware on this new drive.  Tried multiple WD1003FBYX drives - all with the same disappearing act.  A Search for "wdc drive disappears from system" will show you numerous people reporting these type of issues. It has been suggested that this is due to firmware of the drive and it's speed control, which western digital has released a fix for others that had a similar issue as this one. I will add that I believe WDC drives are the best on the market though, so this matter is limited to this drive and specific types of systems. You may not experience the problem.Update: 11/07/2012 - As it turns out, this drive is not compatible with some of the older RAID controllers and found several systems this would consistently fail on using Adaptec 3405. As it so happens, replacing this drive with an older model resolved the issue.

$REVIEW.: Kodak Easyshare V1253 12MP Digital Camera with 3 x Optical ZoomWell, I received mine this afternoon. Initial reaction: it's smaller than I thought it'd be. Feels solid and compact, and looks classy. Comes only with a "getting started guide" in terms of instructions or documentation. A bit disappointed at that. True, there's a CD in the package, but I had taken the camera to the office, and my company has limits on what I can load on my work computer.The said guide is pretty skimpy, only 21 pages if you don't include the legalese and warranty information. I looked for the AC adapter to charge the battery. There isn't one. You can only charge the battery via a USB adapter. And since I could not load the software CD, I could not read any instructions beyond the guide. I connected the camera to my PC, and a blue flashing light came on. All seems OK. After 90 minutes or so, the original blue light became solid, and a second one (with a movie camera icon) started to blink. I figure that meant the charging was done, but let's face, it's only my assumption.I disconnected the cable and turned on the camera. By the way, I own about 6 other digital cameras, so I can tell what the buttons do from their icons or labels, and I can use intuition to assume what they do. The buttons and operation are quite intuitive, and this is a credit to Kodak. The joy stick for menu selections is quite small, and it's easy to push wrongly and select an unwanted option. People with large fingers or not very dexterous will have issues with this type of control.I took about 10 pictures just to try the camera out. Most of the pictures were surprisingly good, but I can tell I'll have to try the many different scene options before I can take pictures reliably. There was some blurriness and fuzziness visible in several of the pictures, which i attribute to indoor light and my shaky hands, I suppose. I will try tomorrow under sunlight conditions.The lack of an AC adapter in the package should be considered carefully by people who travel, especially if they do so without a computer at hand. True, you can buy an adapter from Kodak, but you will have to pay premium and hope there isn't a run on their stock. The camera is not recognized as a removable drive on your Windows XP, so, you will have to use the Kodak software to deal with your stored pictures until you load and save them elsewhere. I will file additional information about a week or two from now, after I become more familiar with this new "cool" toy. Let you'all know ....

$review_text.: I have had this remote for a while. The remote is excellent. I can control every piece of audio/video equipment I own. The software can be a bit weird sometimes, but I think that is a function of it being on a Mac. I have had the remote for nearly 4 years and the volume button is starting to die, so I had to program new volume buttons in the additional buttons sections, which works perfectly. I do wish the charging station was a bit more sturdy. If the remote is not placed perfectly on the cradle, it will not charge (though the battery does last forever). I am going to upgrading to the Harmoney One soon due to the volume button issue, but if the buttons were still working, I was not planning on upgrading.

The only downside is that it does not have a volume control on the headphone, and on United Airlines, I can not lower the volume enough while listening to their audio music (video seems fine..go figure). I think this is an issue with the airline, not the headphone, but a volume control on the headphone would have been great.

$REVIEW.: The enclosed mini disk is useless


 It won't go into the slot in a MacBook Pro
 To get this thing to work, you can surf around and find sites where you are instructed to basically work hacks on your MacBook


 MultiBeast, Kext, yadda, yadda


 The heck with that noise


 I'm a writer, not an engineer!  I will be sending this back


 It's a shame there isn't just some simple plug and play solution, but after watching a YouTube tutorial on TonyMac for a couple of minutes, I realized I would never be able to get this to work, and feared risking bringing some virus or trojan horse on board from some hacker website


 Forget that


 If the vendor can't provide a full-size disk with drivers for all the most common operating systems, they aren't going to get my business.

$REVIEW.: I love this tablet and use it very consistently. I will admit that I am not very experienced with tablets since this is my first one, which makes it so I have nothing to compare it to, but it also tells you about its simplicity, but that doesn't mean it has no customization. Andriod is very very customizable. I'll start off by throwing out a few things that are pros and cons in my book.pros:Very solid product, comfortable to hold, and light.It has amazing battery life.The screen quality is right out superb for a $200ish tablet.It's a nexus, which causes you to get very prompt OS updates giving you the latest of Andriod.Speakers - they put out better sound then many laptops I have seen.It is very simple device to root.There are sleep covers for it so that it doesn't waste battery life when not in use.WiFi reception is good, not amazing, but good.Bluetooth works pretty well. I like using a Bluetooth speaker while using the shower to keep the tablet away from the steam.Charges & syncs using micro-usb so it is easier to find accessories.It normally is a pretty speedy tablet.With buying a simple, three dollar, app you can connect external storage, it doesn't even require rooting.It costs half as much as many comparable tablets benchmark wise making it a great deal.The back, as apposed to some tablets, is not a finger print magnet and it is not slippery.The Nexus is very comparable to the Kindle Fire HD but the nexus runs pure Andriod so it is much more customizable. With the Kindle Fire you are completely locked in Amazon's ecosystem unless you root it, but with the Nexus you can get the Google Play Store and then buy apps for Amazon, Nook, and such, so it gives you much more options.Neutral Comments:Size - seven inches is perfect for me. It may or may not be perfect for you, but it was for me.It runs Android which i like but it will depend on the person. The classic Andriod vs. iOS, which you'll have to decide for yourself which is best for your individual propose.It doesn't cost as much if you buy it from other retailers.Negative:It's a Nexus causing you to get very prompt updates, which sometimes are slightly buggy causing a little lag at times. You get to be used a little like a guinea pig at times. since the 4.2.1 update it has needed reboot two times, but before that it never had to. I am sure it is very temporary thing, and will be fixed soon.There is a lack of compatible apps, let alone optimized for the screen, but the Play Store is growing rapidly, so that's just a matter of time.On a side note, one thing that annoys me with this, and other tablets as well, is there pricing. let me elaborate, charging up to 50 dollars more for only 16 gigs of extra memory is a little steep causing Google to get more off those who need more memory.  I just wish that they'd not be quite as unfair against those of us that need more memory, but that is against all tablet makers not just google/asus.  That said, it is just an amazing deal for a tablet. I have  even read multiple places that Google it taking a loss on the tablet and just hoping to recoup the money through data collection and apps.  so for the price you can't do any better.Finally, I'd like to say, I have owned my tablet for three months and, overall, I am very pleased with it. The Nexus Seven is a good tablet for a mediocre tablet price. It is a solid device that I have recommended and will recommend to anyone in the seven inch tablet market.

It is also has the polarity marked well with a fat, red stripe that is easy to see (unlike some wire I've had where you could barely see the difference between the two sides).

$review_text.: The PS4 is a well built and interesting looking console.  So far, it hasn't really impressed me since there are no games readily available that blow me away.  However, this is a review about the system and not the games.The interface is a bit wonky, I don't love it since I was more used to the PS3's crossbar.  Also, my games didn't transfer from my previous system which was a serious letdown.  I know it's a different architecture and every game would have to ported over but I mean c'mon.  Indie games and PS Store downloads should have been considered to let users partially decommission their PS3 and only use one system.  The fact remains that if I want to play Flower in 1080p, I switch on my PS4.  Otherwise, I have to swap to my PS3 to actually play games.I'm also really upset it doesn't see my DLNA certified NAS I built.  Sony always comes around in due time and as long as they don't compromise every users personal info again, Sony is still my first console of choice (I just really wish Gran Turismo was better then Forza)

 Other than that it is great and works as advertised without any problems

 For me the boot-up was fast and accurate and I wore a wrist band underneath and it was comfortable, but adds a lot of size to my wrist - so this may not be an option for those with large wrist

$REVIEW.: Let me start with a warning that I probably expect more, or at least different things, from a tablet that most buyers.  My primary reason for buying a tablet is to use it in my Jeep for off-road navigation, music and entertainment while otherwise off-the-grid.  So a key factor was great 4G performance.  As an AT&T; customer for over 20 years, I've heard all the amazing claims about Verizon's network coverage.  So I went with Verizon this time and, frankly, I am far from impressed.First of all, Verizon's coverage appears to be no better than AT&T;'s, at least not in the NY/NJ/PA area that I frequent.  So much for the improved service.  Making matters worse is that Verizon charges more for the its monthly data plans than AT&T.;  Finally, even when I have a solid 4G signal, the data throughput is absolutely abysmal.  This little experiment with Verizon has decidedly caused me to abandon any ideas of switching my family's phone service from AT&T.;But more important is that Samsung has done something strange with the headphone jack on this tablet.  Normally I can plug an auxiliary audio cable from the headphone jack to the aux input on my car stereo and have all the sound go through the Jeep's speakers.  This tablet acts as though nothing is plugged-in; all sound continues to go through the internal speaker.  I contacted Samsung support and they could offer no insight or solution.  Thinking this was possibly a defective unit I returned it, and the replacement behaved the same way.  Odd, because we have a wifi-only SGS Tab 2 7" that did not have this problem, nor does my SGS 3 phone.The other odd thing on this (and all other Samsung tablets prior to version 3) is the proprietary sync connector.  While the rest of the world (except Apple, no surprise) has adopted the micro-USB port as a standard, this tablet still uses a proprietary connector.  Not a huge deal, because you can buy extras for around $9 each.  Unless you forget to bring your cable on a trip and can't find anyone else with a Samsung tablet, and then you can't charge your tablet.It is unfortunate that the only 4G Android tablet on the market has such fatal flaws (at least for me).  At this point I'm probably going to give the Tab 2 7.0 to my daughter and buy an Acer tablet and get a MiFi hotspot to use 4G.  I hate to have to carry yet another device, but unless someone steps up with an alternative (that is not a $700 iPad) I see no other options.

From time to time it will surprise you with an acceptible picture (close to very good) but never great

With bright light, a tripod and a frozen bird you may get a great picture

I will continue to use and study this lens but it will not be my primary 300mm telephoto

The Canon IS 300mm will be in my bag
It's o.k


to use this lens to learn camera and lens technique and develope good photography habits
But if you can afford the Canon 70mm-300mm with IS get that instead.Update: After using this lens for several months now, I would like adjust my previous rating of this lens

Perhaps I have developed better lens and camera habits and techniques....

you think
My pictures quality has drasticly improved with this lens


If this lens had IS or VC I would rate a 5 star


As it, I'll go with 4 stars.

 This drive is surprisingly quiet and there is no noticeable vibration at all, this thing just purrs like a kitten and is blisteringly fast!  I upgraded from a Seagate 7200RPM drive and the difference is night in day, more storage, absolutely no noise or vibration (the Seagate was terrible in this regard), and slightly better battery life.If you need this much storage, and 7200RPM spindle speed, do yourself a favor and buy this drive.

$REVIEW.: Corded mice are not really an option for my tastes. Years ago I got tired of the tangle (and sometimes tripping dangers LOL) of having keyboard and mouse cords stretched here and there, and often eventually tangled, so for a very long time I've used both cordless mice and cordless keyboards. The Logitech hardware in this arena is excellent. Both their keyboards and mice which use regular batteries claim LONG battery life, and those claims bear out.For years I've been using the M510, which I've been immensely satisfied with except in one regard: at times it has very irregular performance in games. When I recently saw the G700 as Amazon's daily special, I decided to do some research to see if this could be a viable alternative. I read about the faster rate of communication through the USB dongle and the higher resolution. The combination of the two seemed that they would have a chance to solve my "in-game" issues with the M510, so I ordered it.The short report of the result is that, "Yes, it does solve those problems". The M510 would sometimes get stuck in place on the screen of a high frame rate game, and I'd have to sort of "shake it around" to get it moving again. It was also difficult at times to reliably hit any certain point on the screen. Once I hooked up the G700, those irritating behaviors disappeared completely.I haven't really found any substantial difference in usability in normal personal or productivity applications, and that is just fine, as I had no complaints with the M510 in those applications anyway.The G700 does bring a couple of difference to my lifestyle.First, the battery life (the G700 is rechargable) is measured in a very short number of days, rather than more than a year for a set of AAs in the M510. I'm used to charging devices overnight anyway with various Kindle eInks, Fires, and my iPhone and iPad anyway, so I just have to add this device to the roster of devices to get in the habit of plugging in to recharge ... no big deal.Second, the increased height of this mouse put immediate pressure on the muscles in the top of my arm just behind the wrist. After only an hour or so it was becoming distinctly uncomfortable. I solved this by using a mouse-pad with wrist support. In fact I was already using such a pad, but since I didn't need the raised area I had it rotated away from my hand. So, happily, all I had to do was flip the pad around and I was in business. Since I did that I've had absolutely no discomfort from using the mouse.One word of warning, and the reason why I dock one star: The "free-wheeling mode" of the mouse wheel is a disaster. I tried it for a while and never could get a good feel for how far screens were going to scroll. Additionally, and even worse, in that mode the mouse will scroll your software windows all by itself, even while sitting perfectly still with nothing touching it or moving it. A Google search proved that this is a frequent complaint from owners, and there were no substantially helpful suggestions from Logitech support personel other than to trade it in for a new mouse. I doubt that would work. I'd bet a lot that every G700 suffers from that flawed behavior. Since I don't like the free-wheeling mode anyway, that is no longer an issue for me. The button just down from the mouse wheel toggles between free-wheeling and ratchet modes, so a simple tap of that button fixed this problem for me. To be honest the only reason I was in free-wheeling mode in the first place is that I pushed that button not knowing what it did, and was stuck in that mode until I figured out what I had done to make the mouse operate that way! LOLFor gamers, there are seven macro buttons, and I think 5 different game profiles which can be stored at once. The mouse actually has on-board memory to store the profile settings. I'll probably get into using those at some point, but haven't felt the need to yet.In all respects other than the drawbacks noted above I'm very impressed and happy with the hardware. If you don't mind recharging it (possibly overnight EVERY night) and getting a mouse-pad with wrist support, then I can recommend the G700 without reservation.
$review_summary.: Excellent mouse

$review_text.: I have been a long time fan of the GPS navigation system ever since it came out on the market.  I started from the bulky USB type GPS receiver combined with a software on a notebook and eventually upgraded the system to a combination of a PDA and a bluetooth GPS receiver and finally settled to a dedicated 3.5 inch navigation device.  I have used a GPS from Mio for 3 years and have been very happy with it.  It is a very basic system and does not have cool features.  As a matter of fact, I have never missed the special features of a GPS. Until I used the TomTom Go 740TM Live.  I think the TomTom Go 740TM Live is by far the best GPS system with really helpful features and I am so in love with it.  I will focus on the things that I liked and disliked.The thing I like the most is its voice recognition capability.  Yes, I have used electric devices that claimed to use the voice recognition feature and none of them satisfied my needs.  But this one, the Go 740TM Live really works.  I can do most of the oprerations by simply saying the voice commands.  When I first got this unit, I was little mad about the location of the button for 'clear route'.  I had to bring up the menu, navigate the pages and then select the button for 'clear route'.  Instead of the complicated procedure, now I say 'clear route' quietly to cancel my route.  Yes, you do not need to yell at the GPS to be recognized.  It seems like the mic on the Go 740TM Live is very sensitive.  The popular voice commands are 'sound off/on', 'night(day) view', and 'add to favorite'.  'Home' is my most frequent voice command for sure.I was really impressed by the 'Live Services' that the Go 740TM Live offers.  It is not free and the first 3 months subscription is included.  The service contains the ability to search fuel prices, weather, and Google Local information.  It is fascinating to search on Google for your destination or the doctor you are looking for on the GPS device.  You can get the latest information about almost any category and can even see the ratings for a POI such as restaurants.  You can even call to the place you searched, if your phone is connected via Bluetooth.  Searching Google on your GPS at any time is so cool, especially if you do not have a smart phone.The really helpful feaure for me was 'Where Am I'.  You might have be in situation that you will need to inform where you are in detail. It might be because of a traffic accident or telling your friend where you are or seeking for help.  The Go 740TM Live shows your location in detail in a full sentence.  I am not a native English speaker and so this is convenient for me.  I simply need to read the sentence on the display of the Go 740TM Live.  The sentence includes the street information and the GPS coordinates.  I think this feature might actually save some people.Having the most updated map on a car navigation system is always important and I know that the makers of the map do not update their maps frequently.  In that regards, the concept of map share feature is pretty cool.  You correct the map and people share that information.  Although I have not actually taken advantage of this feature yet, I like that the Go 740TM Live can do that.  You can report map errors and the TomTom's promise 'Lifetime map updates' is so sweet for me.The routing capability of the Go 740TM Live is satisfactory and I have never ran into a problem due to a silly route.  And the traffic information (it's also free for lifetime if I am not mistaken) is somewhat helpful.  I don't live in a crowded city so I have not had many chances to use it.  I took advantage of it once when I went to Chicago and the 'avoiding traffic delay' feature was pretty slick.OK, let's talk about the drawbacks.  First of all, I really don't like the touch sensitivity of the Go 740TM Live.  I have not gotten used to the touch responsiveness of the Go 740TM Live yet.  I still do not type the address correctly due to its poor touch response.  These days, there are just too many devices that use touch interface and work great.  I always have to press harder than I expected to type the information right.  This is one of the reasons that I like voice commands on the Go 740TM Live, however, I cannot type the address using my voice.  Secondly, the power is connected to the mount not, the GPS.  I sometimes want to charge the unit without the mount.  At home, you can charge the Go 740TM Live by using the cradle that comes with it.  Thirdly, some information like weather might not support your area. The city I am living is one of them and I cannot check the weather even if I pay for the service.  I confirmed that the weather information worked pretty well when I was in a major city.  And at last, the fuel price is not always right.  These days, gas stations change their price very frequently, and it would took some time to update the fuel prices on the Go 740TM Live.Overall, the TomTom Go 740TM Live is an excellent GPS.  I am liking it more and more every day.  If it had a very responsive touch interface, I would not hesitate to give 5 stars.  I heartily recommend the TomTom Go 740TM Live to anyone who is very serious about car navigation systems.

$REVIEW.: Perfect, I've used the older version for 2 month now (Yongnou 560) and just purchased Yongnou 560 II. I've also carry  with me a couple of SB900 which has failed me numerous time, problem overheating, which has never happen with either version of my Yongnou. Needless to say I've sold both SB900 to Ebay and kept my 4 sets of Yongnou. Sure they are not built as solid as Nikon, but guess what I can have 10 Yongnou in my bag that will last me for 10 to 15 years instead of purchasing 2 Nikon for a $1000. Hey guess what both can do the same job, you'll just have to learn how to use them in order for you to benefit from it. My suggestion for now, get a remote flash trigger and don't place you flash on the hot shoe of the camera, so you'll have more room to be creative. No one can teach you that, so you will have to keep practicing with it until you begin to see how much power, lights, and distance land on your subject. Sure doing manual is a lot of work, but once you become one with your device, eventually it will become second hand and now it's time to be more creative instead of just bouncing the light. I'm an upcoming photographer, in fact I am going in 4 months. You're probably thinking this guy don't know what he is talking about. Well having 4 months experience in Photography, I have done 8 weddings, 23 Single and Family portraits. My first month practicing with my Nikon D300 I've put almost 20,000 actuation on my camera, the right way of course. Now my D300 act as a backup. Tested Nikon D7000, D700, and D800. I came to conslusion, it all boils down to the image. If you know how to compose your shot, lighting, and the technical aspect of the camera, you don't need to purchase anything beyond D7000. DX vs FX? Take your DX and step back a couple, now you have your self a full frame.......I have more to say but this is getting to look like a Novel. If you have any question email me at PDasalla@Yahoo.com with a subject "Photography do not delete"

The followup emails from the manufacturer asking if I had any issues was a nice touch (albeit an automated touch).I did accidentally order the 6 foot long cable. But this was an amazing accident! I can now use my phone while I'm lying in bed because the cord is now long enough to stretch from the wall outlet to my bed. Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: Great Case


Much better than the more expensive one I bought first

Have not had any problems with it but have only had it for 2 weeks


I do not abuse case though but I do use it


It fits perfectly for the 1st generation of Samsung Tablet 10.1 mobile data version

I understand that the switches are in different places on the Wi-Fi version
It fits like a glove

I amm concerned about the plastic swivel part in the back that allows the tablet to rotate, but only because others have mentioned it


One reviewer mentioned the hole allowed the Apple loge to show through on the iPad, which is probably true, but by being a large hole as opposed to a single point to swivel on, It may make the spinning of the tablet less abusive to the pivot area

I had a phone case with a pivot point on it and it gave up the ghost within weeks


What can I say, I like this case
The fit is perfect.

I was just going to use it with my phone and maybe tablet, but it also included a plug-in for my PSP and iPod. The device is small enough for your pocket, it's quick and easy to use, but it is a little heavier though you shouldn't be holding it for too long.

$REVIEW.: While most of my home connects to the Internet through my wireless router, there were a couple of devices / locations that required Ethernet connectivity.  I was looking for reasonably-priced CAT5e cable to  use for pulling wire to some remote locations within my house.This box of cables fit my needs perfectly... price was very competitive, product arrived quickly and as advertised, and the quality of the cable is just what I needed for home.I'm not a cable expert, so my method of evaluating cable quality is it's ability to get data to my devices quickly.  As a test, I hooked my laptop directly via ethernet to my router and ran a test from Speedtest.net.  I then connected the same laptop to a network drop that I wired using this cable.  The test results were almost identical.  While not the most scientific way to evaluate quality, it's good enough for me.If you are looking for bulk cable to use for common ethernet wiring applications, this is a great choice.

$review_text.: I edit videos on Sony Vegas all the time, so I wanted to speed up my program. This Graphics Card did the job!It makes Sony Vegas run smoother. Also, with this card I can now max out my HD PVR's settings. Very cool!The only problem I had with this is it only had 2 DVI slots and a mini HDMI connector on it. I used VGA previously, so I had to get a VGA to DVI connector. That's about another $10 on Amazon.Still, I suggest this video card if you want to speed up your videos :)Update:After using this card for a while and going into more intensive programs, I did see this card have issues. It'll stutter a bit with Sony Vegas with a bunch of layers and some other pretty hardcore programs.As for gaming, this card runs very well with gaming. You can play games like Battlefield 3 without much of a problem. You definitely won't be able to jack the settings up all the way, but it'll run them without really terrible lag.If you have a pretty stock computer and you're looking for a quick boost in Graphics, buy this card. The requirements aren't very high and it is certainly an upgrade from integrated Graphics.

$review_text.: The main reason why I wanted to purchase this router was because it was an inexpensive dual band router, and it had external antennas. I was nervous when I purchased this router since I hadn't heard of the company and there was little information available about Uspeed.The setup was a little more difficult than I would have expected. This is mainly due to a manual that is poorly worded, as well as the router's interface. Luckily, I have set up routers before and was able to figure out what they meant. After playing around with the settings and hunting through the menus, my router was up and running.Now the real test for this router is going to be durability, I hope that it will continue to function well and that it won't suffer from needing to be reset multiple times.Hopefully they will also release an updated firmware which will correct some of the strange sentences to make it easier to understand what the dialog boxes and menus mean. Uspeed.co could also use an update to make things make a bit more sense.

$REVIEW.: Seagate Business Storage 4-Bay 12TB Network Attached Storage is a good solution for small business and home office to manage and centralized network storage. This seagate network attached storage (NAS) will also provide secure remote access and provide backup for your data to protect from data loss due to hard disk failure (with RAID 1, 5 or 10 configuration).  The Seagate Business Storage is an improvement (and faster) from the Seagate Blackarmor NAS series and also relatively easier to set up. This NAS has two USB 3.0 ports (for additional storage or printers) and two Gigabit Ethernet ports. The individual disk drive can also be hot-swapped. This NAS works with PC, MAC, Windows 8 phone, iPhone/iPad and Android (using free apps for iPhone/iPad and Android).Some of the things that you can do with this Seagate Business Storage Network Attached Storage:1. Create a central storage place for the files you want to share with other people on your local network or over the Internet.2. Create and maintain automatic backup copies of all your files, even your operating systems.3. Share your files with other people on your local network or with business clients over the Internet.4. Recover quickly from a computer disaster, such as unintentional files deletion, disk drive failure, or computer theft.5. Access your Seagate NAS over the Internet from anywhere in the world to upload or download files.6. Share a USB printer with other people on your local networkSidarta Tanu

$review_text.: The FPS Pro for the XBOX 360 is officially licensed and is a nice, sturdy product

The plastic and rubber is high quality and has a nice feel to it


The joypad is neither to big nor too small and fits well in my medium sized hands


The contours on the back of the pad allow me to comfortably rest my pinky, ring, and middle fingers while I am playing.The two rubberized sections on the sides has some treads(like a tire) so my palm can rest nicely without slipping during heavy gameplay


The pad itself features four shoulder buttons placed horizontally and vertically

The horizontal/vertical layout I found to be intuitive and aids during gameplay.The two analog sticks are smooth and control well


The choice of four lighted colors below the analog sticks look cool, but also has a function

You can adjust the "Combat" button settings(LSB,RSB,Y,X,A,B) wit a corresponding color to remember the button settings.The gamepad also comes with a USB cable adaptor to allow you to use this pad for your PC or laptop gaming, very convenient

The only drawback I found with this pad is that the directional pad is a little stiff(not an issue if you mostly use the analog sticks)

Otherwise this is a great gamepad that is high quality, responsive during gameplay, and is versatile.

$REVIEW.: As I'm sure most of you have read any of the other 200+ reviews on this tablet by now, it's a rather powerful tablet shackled to a dead carcass known as Tap-N-Tap, which happens to be the factory operating system and user interface.There is, however, hope for anyone wanting to find a rather competitive tablet on both the performance and value front in this unit.  This tablet has gobs of potential IF you're willing to take some time to study up on flashing (replacing) the operating system with a different one, apparently designed by someone more accurately representing a software programmer.  An extremely detailed guide about this can be found by googling the phrase "sticky guide install clockwork" and clicking I'M FEELING LUCKY.  If you follow that guide EXACTLY as it's typed, you'll find this tablet to be everything you could want, and more.  I can't list the link itself, as it is against Amazon rules to use outside links.Back when the tablet was released in November of 2010, it had on it top-of-the-line hardware that outperformed the iPad on almost every level...with exception to 2 distinct areas.  #1 - the software is buggy, slow, full of errors and just downright awful.  As discussed above, that can be fixed easily with average know-how and about a good 30-45 minutes of free time and patience.  The 2nd item, however, will be with you for life if you pick up one of these tablets......The screen, as I'm sure you've read by now elsewhere, has a VERY slim margin of acceptable viewing angles.  When holding the tablet landscape (long-ways) and looking perfectly perpendicular to the screen, it looks excellent.  However, tilting the screen as much as 10-15 degrees forward or backwards will start to darken or lighten the screen noticeably.  Much further will make it very difficult to read.  Viewing angles seem extremely hampered by the cheaper LCD screen, which is something you will have to live with if you'd like this tablet.  Turning the tablet sideways to portrait (up-and-down) sort of gives you a headache after awhile, as your eyes perceive different levels of brightness and clarity since your eyes are both viewing the tablet from a different angle...and since neither eye will be perpendicular to the optimal viewing angle, one will be seeing the screen darker than it should be and the other will see it brighter than it should.  You could see how this gets a little annoying.  I would HIGHLY suggest trying to find one of these in stores before purchasing if you have your doubts about the screen working for you.  Sears, Staples, Office Depot and Kmart are a few places that have been carrying them in stock regularly.The factory software and screen aside, it doesn't really get any better.  You won't have GPS capabilities, but the tablet does come with both WIFI and Bluetooth options.  Boot up time is relatively quick, and my current ROM a.k.a. operating system (Vegan-Tab Ginger) makes the most of the G Tablet's hardware with very smooth movement and quick actions.  It weighs approximately 0.05 lbs more than the original iPad; making it almost identical when it comes to heft.As with everything technology related, you'll find that the top-of-the-line hardware, albeit only 6 months old, has already been trumped by a number of tablets out there...although you'll pay at least twice as much for them.  As long as you're willing to dig your hands in the dirt a little, you'll find this to definitely be a diamond in the rough.Once the price dropped below the $300 mark, I couldn't find a reason not to make the jump to the G Tablet.  Considering how a Xoom and iPad2 can rarely be had @ even $600, it's an extremely budget friendly buy for someone who doesn't HAVE to have the very best of the best in every aspect.  For the budget minded, it doesn't get much better than this.

$REVIEW.: I've owned only Canon brand cameras for the past 10 years or so.  I was looking to upgrade my SD880IS to something with HD video capture and a longer optical zoom than the typical 3-4x found in the Canon slim cameras.  I decided to give the Nikon S8000 a try.  Results are definitely mixed.  The most important feature of any camera is its ability to capture great still images, and the S8000 is absolutely superb in this respect.  At full 10x optical zoom, it captures breathtaking images.  Very few slim cameras offer this level of optical zoom, one of the main features I was seeking.  Unfortunately, the HD video capture doesn't enjoy the same success.  I found that an annoying high frequency whistle accompanies all video recording when playing back on my computer, something I never encountered with my Canon products.  Some might describe what I'm hearing as a tinniness to the sound.  In order to use video captures from this camera, I'll have to post-process the video to filter out the frequency of the whistle sound.  Also, the HD video didn't seem smooth, and it kind of had the effect of being captured at a slower fps rate.  A design issue I found with the S8000 was that the pop-up flash is inconveniently placed.  Often when the camera needed to engage the flash, my left pointer finger was resting on top and prevented the flash from lifting.  Nikon likely foresaw this as an ergonomic design problem, and the camera issues an onscreen message to the user saying that the flash was unable to deploy.  Would have been more convenient for the user if Nikon had integrated the flash into the camera body.The negatives on the video capture performance and the flash placement, the S8000 does take beautiful still images.  If you plan to do mostly still shots and want a slim camera with lots of optical zoom, the S8000 would be a great choice.  If you plan to use the S8000 often for video capture, which I was hoping to do, then perhaps wait until Nikon issues a firmware update for the S8000, or perhaps wait until the next post-S8000 release from Nikon.  Canon seems to put out new camera models every year, but I don't know Nikon's plans for their product releases.  If Nikon fixes the noise in the video capture, then my rating would be at least 4 stars, perhaps even 5 stars.

$review_text.: I'm no textile expert, but color aside, these seem identical toZwipes, which I consider one of the best purchases I ever made.GarageMate microfiber towels can be used dry or wet.  They are great for picking up dust, or spills, so keep a couple handy inside your vehicle.  Used wet, you really only need water, except for dirt that requires solvent (tar, bug splatter).  You can add a drop of dishwashing liquid to a bucket if the dirt is crusty.  Wipe on, then wipe off with a dry towel.  You can use them inside the house, too.  Great for cleaning glass and mirrors.These are sturdy, absorbent, machine-washable, and dry quickly.  Do not use fabric softener or dryer sheets.  I often machine wash and hang them to dry.So, look, guys.  You know that skanky bunch of old t-shirts and sweat socks you've been hoarding for car washing?  Get rid of them and get these.  They work ten times better!  And they don't get musty.  And remember, a girl likes a clean car, but she doesn't have to know how little effort you put into it.

$review_text.: Heed the warning. If anyone gives more than three stars they must work for the company or something.  I won't argue the sound of this headset, it is nice. But I guarantee that with average use, they won't last more than a year, and with the price you pay, they should last much longer.  I was quite disappointed.  As the other ratings on the durability of this headset, they are terrible.  I wish I could get my money back.  I have tried many headsets in my life, and must say that the Bose AE have left me frustrated beyond belief. I'm a frequent traveler for the military, and depend on the comfort of music and my books on audio when I travel.  All four of my Bose headsets have defaulted on me.  This set in particular have cracked both times leaving me with a left and right headphone separated.  This is inexcusable.  Bose cannot say they are unaware of this issue because the complaints are widespread and found to anyone who wishes to search for a rating or review of all their AE (around ear 1 and 2) headsets.Again, heed the warning.  Try these [ASIN:B0042ETXRQ Denon AH-D1100 Advanced Over-Ear Headphones (Black)]] instead if you have the money to burn on a Bose AE headset.

$REVIEW.: Grace Digital's Wi-Fi Music Player A.K.A Mondo (Black) is a very good Internet Radio player - there is no doubt about it. We now have a very serious contender for theLogitech Squeezebox. Competition is always good. It will make ways for better products in the future and I strongly believe on this that - "Internet Radio" is the future of radio technology.Well, I have seen AM Radios - Long Wave, Medium Wave, Short Wave Radios in my past, Then came "FM radio" and I was blown away by the "Stereo" sound and still is a very good medium to listen to even though the broadcasting range is severely limited. Satellite Radio is there but comes with a steep price in terms of monthly fees and the hardware to run it is generally more expensive also.Internet Radio which was already there in the PC is now being made available in a portable easy to use interface without the need for a PC to stream music from radio stations.The beauty of Internet Radio technology is that you are not limited to a specific location in order to receive the broadcasts around the world, now you are not limited to local stations on your AM dial or FM dial nor you need a long antenna to get Stereo sound. Internet radios like Grace Digital's Mondo makes listening to radio stations around the world super easy!PROS[+] Sound quality is very good - Love it![+] Rich Glossy Black design - Looks beautiful![+] Remote and all accessories includedCONS[-] Remote feels very cheap.While it is a serious contender for logitech's Squeezebox there are some annoying bugs which can be easily fixedby firmware update. Please read the comments section to see the observations in detail and feel free to comment on them.As it stands now, if you were to choose betweenLogitech Squeezebox Radio Music Player with Color Screen (Black)andGrace Digital Wi-Fi Music Player with 3.5-Inch Color Display (GDI-IRC6000) (Black)I would still consider Logitech Squeezebox for the feature rich offerings and excellent display even though it does not include remote.If good quality sound (Ability to stream at high bit rates) and ease of having a Snooze button is a priority for you then Mondo is a very good choice!Bottom-line: It is a 3 star product! It is a very good Internet Radio player - No doubt about it.If the price falls below 120 dollars it is a "steal" and will have serious competition with Logitech's Squeezebox.

$REVIEW.: My 12 year old computer's network card slot failed about 4 years ago.  So I used a WiFi adapter for about a year or two until I found this product.  It works great.  Unlike a USB WiFi adapter which can sporadically buffer out or lose signal, this USB to Ethernet adapter never times out.  Strong signal all the time.  Only limiting factor in dinosaur of a PC that I use this with is the USB 2.0 port is not gigabit ready, only 100MB capable; not a big deal though.  I've been using this for over 2 years now.  Good product if your in a pinch having Ethernet connectivity problems with your Network Card, or can be used on any device with a full sized USB port to enable an internet connection (i.e; older tablets, etc.)

$review_text.: If you read the reviews on this lens, you will find that it is highly regarded as a bargain...when it works.  After having several Tamron lenses, the 17-50mm/2.8 confirmed the following for me:- When they are good, Tamron's provide excellent value for the money- Construction quality is mediocre but consistent with price.- Tamron has some of the worst auto focus problems (at least on my Nikon gear).- I will never ever buy another Tamron lens unless I can return it or test it thoroughly before buying.If you haven't guessed by now, I think Tamron is a frustrating crap shoot.  I have a 90mm/2.8 Macro that is superb, a 28-75mm/2.8 that is capable of great results and the 17-50mm/2.8 which is basically worthless.Except for the 90mm macro, both zooms exhibited auto focus problems with the 17-50mm/2.8 being near impossible to correct for front focus.  I have a Nikon D300 that fortunately allows for AF fine tuning.  The D300 could not compensate enough so I sent the lens back to Tamron and still have problems.  I have to allow for maximum adjustment and it is still slightly out of focus, requiring to stop down 1.5 stops or so to get sufficient DOF to compensate.  If that isn't bad enough, the AF is inconsistent and anemic.  Perhaps I am spoiled with the AF-S on my Nikkors, but the Tamron built-in motor is slow, noisy and searches for focus...and this is on a camera with one of the finest AF systems on the market.As further evidence of Tamron's QC issues, the previous version without the built-in motor had a production problem where the front lens element would come loose due to a faulty filter ring.  You can find videos on You Tube documenting the problem.Bottom line, don't buy this lens unless you can return in the event you get a lemon(s).  Tamron is never going to win any QC awards.

$review_text.: I picked up this card, because I wanted an inexpensive HDMI solution for my HTPC. I've been very pleased with its performance so far. It's quiet and powerful enough to drive my TV at full 1920x1080 resolution. The AMD Catalyst software even allowed me to extend the display to get rid of the think black boarder initially around my picture. I really like that it carries video and audio in one simple connection. My only gripe is that when I turn on my TV before waking up PC, occasionally I'll get no sound - but in fairness, that could be more of an issue with my TV than the card. If you're looking for a good half-height PCI-E HDMI card, then I highly recommend this one.

$REVIEW.: I bought this one for monitoring my five kids using computers, tablets, and smartphone.Since I'm new to it, I'm getting to know how to use it what it can do. The software is fairly simple though you have to study to use it to the maximum.However the issue is about the hardware. The route emits wifi signal not strong. When I have my laptop just 15 feet away from the router, I get only four sticks of signal on it. Hope they offer better one.Because of it I give just three stars. Otherwise I would give four or four and half.If you have a big house with four bed rooms, you may need two of  them.

I tried them out today and they were great. I could hear everything the others said just fine. I clipped the microphone to my seatbelt and it worked just fine, I was told it was easy to understand me.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars in that the ear bud is really hard and uncomfortable, it's pretty much like the one that comes with the iPod. I do have a solution though that I've used with my iPod buds, I just ordered a pair of Yurbuds, which are soft rubber and slip over the bud. They will make it comfortable and keep it in my ear.

I considered simply returning the item and getting a refund.  Instead, I opened the lamp housing and I set the bulb back in place and clipped the housing back together.Installation went smoothly and the lamp worked.  Let's see if it lasts the purported 6000 hours.I am not happy with the condition in which it arrived.  The lamp worked after I fixed it, but it's something I should not have had to do.

$REVIEW.: My home has cat5e cables in the walls already, so I figured this would be the ideal solution to running HDMI from where the TV was mounted, to the equipment. I have a 5.1 surround sound system/HDMI switcher, Satellite receiver and DVD player. The A/V reciever and DVD pplayer could be controlled by my TV though this CEC function that is part of the HDMI cable.  But when I replace the direct HDMI cable with this unit, so the cables were in the wall, the control part did not work.  The TV did not recognize my sound system nor the DVD player. Sound and video comes through OK, so that part works fine, just don't expect to control your equipment over cat5e cables.

$review_text.: I bought this for my prepper arsenal


 It's a compact device that will do pretty much everything it should do and provide radio services that does not depend on the power grid to work


 As mentioned, the small size will let you grab and stash it anywhere
 It's covered in a durable rubber lining that's easy to grip and handle


 The controls are easy to see and utilize


 Multiple power sources, built-in rechargeable battery, which is charged with a mini-USB/plug adapter interface, 3-AAA's, hand-crank, or solar panel
 The built-in flashlight will do the job in a crunch, but don't expect much from it.The FM and weather stations come in well, but the antenna seems a bit flimsy, and if broken, will almost render the radio useless without a hack/fix for it


 I do like the shortwave radio ability for extra measure


 In the event of a real emergency when all the telecommunications networks temporarily go down, this may be your only communication to the world
 I found the NOAA alert feature is great to have
 This is the reason this device is actually plugged in at all times

 Since owning this, it's gone off multiple times for severe thunderstorms in my local county (in the high mountains)
 Incredibly useful.I have never personally used this in an emergency situation, but having so many power options, including the solar and hand-crank, I have no doubt this will be a useful tool if an emergency does occur
 I'm already considering getting another one for our camping adventures and leave one at home.

$REVIEW.: the mouse tracks very nicely, but I find the wheel totally horrible.  It rolls readily & totally smoothly -- i.e. no "clicks" and no resistance whatsoever -- ironically making scrolling far from effortless.  After correcting for the vague over- or underscrolling that's to be expected en route to the desired scroll amount, one has to be very careful/attentive not to brush the scroll wheel and inadvertently scroll more when placing a hand on, or removing a hand from, this mouse.One reason I got this mouse was because of the tilt-wheel switches, but I don't use the side-tilts for the same reason:  inadvertent scrolling during lateral movement.(Inadvertent scrolling is also an issue to be careful about when using the wheel to middle click.)After enough accidental clicks of the side button; they're now disabled, too.  .... or maybe not.  I just reached to do something with the mouse, inadvertently both moved the wheel *and* touched a side button, and found the text size on the page suddenly got bigger.  Bizarrely, I find I can only make text bigger, not smaller!!! so hopefully I can resolve this by revisiting the configuration SW.Also, you have to download the SW from the web.  Fine; but the web site provides 2 software components for this mouse, and installation of the second fails, as it says a newer version of this SW is already installed on my Win7 box.  I can't find that 2nd package in my start menu nor in the installed programs list, so I don't know what's up with that.Also -- and I don't know if this is something in Google Chrome or with this mouse, but -- I find Chrome's responsiveness to this mouse slow.  This is something I never noticed with my previous mouse -- or any other mouse/app combination ever before on any machine, for that matter.  for example, I middle click 2 adjacent links to open them in new tabs:  the 1st link opens in a new tab, but -- even though I clicked it while the mouse cursor was over it -- the 2nd middle click is processed as if it occurred in the space between the 2 links.Bottom line recommendation:  find something else.

$REVIEW.: I picked this unit after much research, for a home-made robot (class project)

Here's the scoop:For the price, it's fantastic!Performance: Our best results, with a fresh battery, camera unit transmitted ~200' of open parking lot AND ~75' of industrial building w/ lots of flouro/wifi etc
with minimal interference


However, signal strength fell off with batt pwr
Unfortunately, we used a variety of 9Vs at various stages of use or I'd have a lifespan for you

Best guesstimate is minimum 30 minutes full strength from fresh batt.We also played around with it indoors, with the AC adapters on both units.Either way, you'll occasionally have to tweak the RX tuner for best reception if the camera is mobile, or the environment changes (body blocking the antenna of the Tx etc.) See that little knob by the Rx unit's antenna? That's the tuning knob.How does it work?Camera unit powered by AC adapter, or 9V battery (short life as expected) sends audio & video to receiver unit.Receiver unit->RCA cables->TV/VCR/whatever (I used an old portable TV/VCR combo from a junk sale)


No "Wifi" here.If this thing had night-vision AND digital tuning it'd have 6 out of 5 stars


Speaking of IR, this camera will detect IR like most digi-cameras
 The only test I managed to do before it's demise* was to point a TV remote at it in a sealed darkroom, and it did register the IR LED.*The TX unit was smoke-checked by an idiot miswiring an improvised AC adapter after we lost the first one, but I'm definitely getting another.

$SUMMARY.: Great little cheap mini-cam unit

$review_text.: This cable is completely functional, When comparing the price of the AmazonBasics USB A to Lightning cable to that of Apples offerings, you can immediately see why this product is so popular


There are, of course, cheaper alternatives on amazon, but from personal opinion, they are not 100% compatible with the iphone 5/5s/5c

Apple senses this and immediately bricks those cords, unfortunately


 However, when comparing this cable to other cellphone cables which accomplish the exact same thing, it is overpriced


This isn't Amazon's problem as much as Apple's, however, it's still a notable issue, and should impact your purchasing decision of an iPhone.

$SUMMARY.: A cheap and completely functional alternative to the oppressive Apple lightning cable

$REVIEW.: Economical replacement for old PC with Windows XP. Comes with Windows 7 Pro OS, Wifi and DVD burner. Research before buying any new system is a must, as many of my old files were NOT compatible with this OS, but that is Micro Soft problem. If I could afford it I would have bought a Mac! This is the last time I'm keeping a Micro Soft product. To update MS stuff costs a fortune and they limit your subscription to a year. This PC was plug and play, customer support fair.

$REVIEW.: Very rugged, sleek looking cover -- especially for eight bucks.  Other reviewers have stated this case is bulky, and it is definitely not thin.  But this also means its not flimsy.  Can't tell you how much my iPad is tossed around and this thing really protects it.  I have also seen some reviews that stated the cover is warped on arrival. Yep, it bows outward, but you can bend it back the other way and it will remain flat after that.  I think the inner material used to stiffen the front cover is actually plastic, because it feels harder than cardboard.  To straighten mine out, I opened it up and put the front cover on my kitchen counter, put a hand towel over top of the vinyl surface and ironed it with a warm (not hot) iron and some heavy pressure.  It has been flat as a board ever since.  Even that is not enough to make me give it less than five stars. As a matter of fact, I am buying a second one just in case the one I have now starts to wear out.  Sooner or later I am going to have to replace my trusty old 1st gen. iPad.  Since the iPad 1 fits in this so snugly, I am hoping this case will also fit one of the newer versions as well.
$review_summary.: Like it so much, I am buying a spare!

$review_text.: Works great in the Nook I converted to an Android tablet. Can use these cards to create a bootable disk, then boot to the card and wipe the native Nook OS and replace it with Android Jelly Bean 4.x to turn the Nook into a full fledged tablet. SanDisk 8MB are the most recommended cards for this process. Afterward the card is used as extra storage. (Note: the card comes blank... everything I just described has to be done by the user by researching how to do this and creating a bootable disk, etc.)

$review_text.: I love this little thing. Purchased for a wedding I was filming and this thing is pretty awesome. I've never owned a tripod but have dealt with Professional videography equipment at my church. Such as 18thousand dollar cameras sitting on 5000dollar tripods. So knew I wanted fluid head. and for the price and functions of this tripod I wouldn't have gone with anything else. From the shortest height to the tallest it is perfect. Pan and tilt are smooth. No jerking motion. The controls on the handle are EXTREMELY useful and I find them necessary. Also has a level bubble on top so you can adjust the legs independently so that the camera sits level. I use this function alot for when I'm outside recording some shooting action. Whether pistol, long gun, or some trap. I highly recommend this tripod to anyone with a sony camcorder especially if it has the input for the handle controls.

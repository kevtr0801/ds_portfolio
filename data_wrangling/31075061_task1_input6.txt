$REVIEW.: The Portege Z835 has treated me quite well as an ultrabook on the cheaper side.  I bought it for my aunt and used it for a while before ultimately giving it to her (as a computer enthusiast, gamer, and programmer, I wanted to make sure it was as good as it seemed), and it definitely was a good choice.Performance:The computer is, as you might expect from the specs of the computer, fast. The 128GB SSD ensures that programs open almost instantly, and while the processor, the intel core i3 model, is on the lower end of Intel's line of processors, it is still zippy and over 2 times as fast as the last generation core 2 duo processors.  The combination of that with a generous 4GB of ram make this ultrabook respond very well, so long as you aren't doing anything particularly strenuous like gaming, which this computer really isn't designed for. If you want to watch movies, listen to music, do text editing, and the like, this laptop is pretty great. It's also quiet in all those cases, too. I haven't tried playing any games on it--if I get the opportunity, I'll edit this post with that info.Battery life is excellent. In normal use it doesn't reach 8 hours like Toshiba claims, but more like 6 is a reasonable estimate.  That's pretty great for what is packed inside the laptop. Finally, it's reliable. I never had it crash on me or overheat. Excellent.Weight/build:This thing is LIGHT.  Just like many other ultrabooks you may have seen, this is among the lightest 13" computers I've ever seen. I can't wait for the day that every laptop is this light. It also feels reasonably well built.  While the hinge of the laptop tends to wobble a little bit, it isn't much of an issue and doesn't make me feel less secure about the laptop's structural integrity.Peripherals:The webcam is pretty average, but that isn't a deal-breaker at all.  the keyboard feels more or less solid, although while the keys are normal sied they are spaced out a bit too much so i wish the individual keys were a little bigger (not a big deal, but just something I noticed).  The trackpad is very basic--don't expect fancy multitouch features. That being said it works quite reliably since it doesn't rely on weird trackpad buttons or finnicky multitouch gestures (you got us there, Apple!).  Ports are fantastic for an ultrabook--lots of USB slots, HDMI to hook up monitors, a card reader. This blows away most of the competition's port selection.Conclusion:While other laptops may feel more solid or look more aesthetically pleasing than this one, this ultrabook beats most of them out on price.  Definitely look around for this laptop around the internet to see what's the lowest price you can snag--if you're in the market for an ultrabook, you can score this cheaper than the rest and have a really solid experience with it.

$REVIEW.: I'm glad I got this version that has both Firewire and USB
I wanted Firewire so I could get the ultra-fast connection, but it would disconnect suddenly every 5 minutes, whether i was doing a backup or not


This made it impossible to complete a backup

I just switched to USB and it's been backing up for a couple days straight now with no disconnections
So far so good!

$REVIEW.: I bought 3 of these 2GB units to use as boot devices for my HDD recovery software.  These units TOTALLY FAILED!!!  All were Totally Non-Functional as boot devices!!!  DO **NOT** buy these units for this purpose!!! (They have other problems as well, sadly.)In addition, the PNY Thumb Drive hangs up the computer if you leave it plugged in and reboot the main machine (and have your BIOS configured to look at the USB ports).  And now for more details:I've used several other brands successfully for the bootable function; the 1 & 2GB HP Flash/Thumb Drives work admirably well, as does the Kingston and other brands.  One simply runs the software to write the boot sector and set all the right bits, and the "drive" should boot.  It doesn't.  (NB: Since the software I'm installing is smaller than 100MB, 1 or 2 GB is plenty big enough.  Note that the unit is being formatted to FAT16, since it's capacity is only 2GB.)No error message is given at any point; the programs I've used all think everything is peachy-keen (to use a precise, engineering term) when they're done.  I've used multiple programs and they all think that they've done their job properly.The problem is that when you then try to boot from the unit it hangs the computer solidly.  All the computer's keys are frozen.  If you remove the drive and try to proceed, the computer is still frozen.  (I've tried 2 different machines -- Lenovo & Acer -- with the same results.) The only possible recovery is to remove the unit, and then do a HARD RESET of the computer. This is More than Unfriendly; it's positively Hostile!And it's not like it just fails as a boot device; the fact that it hangs the computer EVERY TIME it's left plugged in and you restart the OpSys is Very Nearly unbelievable.  How could such a design flaw make it into such a simple and mature product!!!  Sheish!As an engineer, I'd have to rate this design flaw as positively and Totally Unacceptable! This is Not a complex product; it's an extremely mature one that should be a cinch to get right. If I were managing the team with a bug like this one I would tell them to fix it or take the time they spent developing it as vacation; they certainly shouldn't get paid for this.What is this product good for?  You can use it to hold temporary data that you take to another party, such as photos to a service bureau or Costco/Walmart.  In that application you plug the device in, write whatever, and remove it.  But the key is you gotta REMOVE It from the computer!  Do NOT leave it plugged in...And, of course, this is a problem because every time you insert & remove a device from your USB connector you're causing wear.  These connectors do not last forever, after all.So what am I going to do with my PNY flas drives?  Give them to the Boy Scouts to use as prizes is about the best Idea I've had so far.  They're too small to use as boat anchors.
$SUMMARY.: It HANGS the computer & can NOT be made Bootable!

I get the major networks and PBS. Was able to drop expensive cable/satellite service. Between this and Internet TV I've got more TV than I can watch or would want. Between Netflix, Hulu Plus and Amazon I'm pretty much covered. The price was right. If I decide to upgrade later I would probably go with a motorized directional antenna next time.Note: Check online for your area map for aiming the antenna. It saves a lot of setup time.

$REVIEW.: I bought 4 of the QSC48030 cameras about a year ago to use with the Q-See 4-input pci card and there are good and not so good points.Pros -(1) All cameras have worked continuously for a year without any failures.(2) The cameras use very little electricity so a good battery backup unit can keep them going for a very long time.(3) The infrared night vision works fairly well out to about 80 feet(4) The picture quality in the daylight hours and partial daylight is very good. At night you have the normal black and white look as expected.Cons -(1) Q-See customer service will respond back to an inquiry but don't ask them any real questions ... they may tell you anything.(2) The cameras have no focus mechanism and so everything is not in sharp focus and a person needs to be fairly close to the camera to get a clear picture that the police could use.(3) At night, you may see some concentric whitish circles on the outside edges (of the image on the computer) which makes it almost impossible to make out any details of anything in that area. That made a couple of the cameras lose about one third of the coverage. The Customer Service people indicated that condition is normal with no explanation as to why two of the cameras did not have the same problem. As I said, they may just tell you anything. I found that the problem is a buildup of a haze and oily substance on the inside of the protective glass across the lens and LED's. I unscrewed the cover (had to use a auto filter wrench on 3 of them) and cleaned the inside and outside of the glass and used compressed air to blow off the lint. That fixed the problem. So why didn't the factory "experts" know about that??(4) The cables that come with the cameras are very fragile and I would suggest you buy your own to save the hassle of having to redo the work of running cables in the attic.Overall for a budget priced system that gives a fairly good output these cameras work fine but if you want to be able to focus and pan, and get a sharp picture,  you will need to pay a few hundred more for each camera.

$REVIEW.: I have tested this device for the past 2 years.  It holds up.  It is physically a very well built device and probably will not break.  That said, it probably will not work, either.  The driver is old and not kept up-to-date.  The Belkin support page is not helpful.  There is no date on the driver page or the EXE, so you have no way to know if there was an update since you last installed it or whether or not you have the latest version.  I don't know about you, but I hate having to contact people about this.  If I have to call support just to find out the version number, the driver has not been properly supported in the first place.There is also a design flaw.  The outer shell is so big that it covers up other nearby USB slots on most computers.  It requires an extension cord in my case.

$REVIEW.: I bought these headphones for myself to use while on the treadmill.  It's so hard to hear the tv with the treadmill on.  I just plug this to the tv (which sits right above the treadmill) and I can hear it just fine.  I've owned three previous pairs of noise canceling or noise reducing headphones and I like these best.The headphones are comfortable and lightweight.  I've had some that are very large and heavy or go behind the head, which I did not like.They are easy to adjust to any head size.  My children use them while in the car.  I do have another set of headphones that do not adjust at all and my kids fight each other because they both want these.The cord rewinds into the headphone so we don't have dangling wires to deal with when in storage.The headphones fold up easily into a nice compact shape.  I did once have a pair of noise canceling headphones that folded up into a smaller size, but this is compact enough for travel and the other features make this size perfectly acceptable to me.Some noise canceling headphones make a humming noise when the noise cancellation feature is activated.  I can hear a low level of white noise when these are on, which I don't mind at all.  I don't notice it when there is background noise (when else would we activate it?), so it's not a problem.  Just glad there's no audible hum.The sound is crisp and clear with no static.I'm glad I bought these headphones and would buy them again if I need more.

$REVIEW.: REVIEW OF SILVERSTONE SST-FP35BPREMIUM 3.5" DEVICE BAY CARD READER WITH FULL FEATURED FRONT I/O PORTSGENERAL DESCRIPTION:I was looking for a way to add front ports to my middle-age P4 computer case, as connecting stuff to the back is just a pain


USB and audio at the very minimum, a card reader would be extremely welcome.After much research across the web and, of course, Amazon, it turns out that there aren't many choices

And some of those choices offer for example, card readers unable to read SDHC cards that are found everywhere nowadays.I finally bought the best one I could find: Silverstone's FP35B
(Be aware that FP34 is similar, but won't read SDHC cards).The device has the following features:1 - USB 2.0 port (if connected to internal USB 2.0 header).1 - IEEE1394 (Firewire) port (if connected to internal 1394 header).1 - e-SATA port (if connected to internal SATA port).1 - Mic input/Headphone-Lineout output (when connected to internal AC97 audio header)
Alternate connection for High Definition Audio (Azalia).1 - 12V output jack1 - 5V output jack1 - Slot for SD/MMC/xD/MS memory cards.1 - Slot for CF/MD memory cards.Comes with 1 Silver panel, 1 Black panel, 4 mounting screws and one cable for powering external equipment.Claims to work in Windows 98, Me, 2000, XP, Vista, MAC OS 9.x, MAC OS X.Product came in a real box, nicely packaged, not just a plastic bag.INSTALLATION:Instructions are very limited (you can see the product manual at FP35B's download area [...] ).Be sure to check the Q&A; area as well: There is useful stuff in there.The FP35 came fitted with a Black front panel


Since my case is Ivory, I thought that the Silver plate would look better

Exchanging them is not difficult but it's not described in the manual


Be careful not to break any of the small plastic tabs as otherwise the panel may end up loose.If you are not experienced with PC hardware, you will need help figuring out installation and use
Also, you MUST have your motherboard and/or expansion cards  manuals at hand, in order to identify the proper connection points for the several cables coming out of the FP35B.I am used to installing hardware, so it took no time to install.No software is provided nor (usually) required: XP recognized it at boot


Windows 98/ME users will need to download a driver from the link above.TESTING:USB PORT: Use it like any USB port

As it is just a front plate connection to an internal port, it will be as good/bad as any other USB port in your motherboard


(and as such, support would have to come from your motherboard manufacturer)

I used it and it worked flawlessly for me.IEEE1394 (FIREWIRE) PORT: Use it like any IEEE1394 port
As it is just a front plate connection to an internal port, it will be as good/bad as any other IEEE1394 port in your motherboard


(and as such, support would have to come from your motherboard manufacturer)


My equipment doesn't have a IEEE1394 internal header, so this port remains unconnected/untested by me.FP35B's internal IEEE1394 cable comes with two ends: one 9-pin plug and nine 1-pin plugs

I'd guess 1394 internal headers are not standard, so check your motherboard manual before connecting!!!E-SATA PORT: Use it like any e-SATA port

As it is just a front plate connection to an internal port, it will be as good/bad as any other SATA port in your motherboard

(and as such, support would have to come from your motherboard manufacturer)
My equipment doesn't have a free SATA internal port, so this port remains unconnected/untested by me.AUDIO JACKS: My computer only has a standard AC97 internal header, so I can't say anything about FP35B's HD capabilities


To connect the FP35B's internal audio cable, I had to remove two jumper blocks from the motherboard's audio header
Again, check your motherboard manual before connecting!!!I have used both a microphone and headphones, and the audio quality is good: I heard no noise or interference, even when using the other ports at the same time.However, inserting the headphone's plug didn't mute the computer's back Line Out jack, and so I had to turn off my external amplifier when using headphones (no big deal)
This doesn't comply with AC97 standard


(Bug or feature? You be the judge).+5V/+12V JACKS: The FP35B provides two external power jacks
These are intended to power devices like external hard disk drives without the need for their external power brick (or "wall wart" as some people calls them)
This is an interesting idea that I haven't yet tested/used.The jacks are powered internally by means of a standard 4-pin molex connector.The provided external power cable has two small connectors on one end that plugs in the +5V and +12V jacks
They look the same but the +5V plug cannot be inserted in the +12V jack (this is good!).The other end of the external power cable has one 6-pin mini din plug, one 4-pin mini din plug, and a +12V plug (inner center is +, outer ring is GND)

Pinouts are described in the manual.BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL when using this feature!!! If your external device power pin-outs differ from the ones provided by FP35B's external power cable, your computer and/or external device will be SEVERELY DAMAGED!!!CARD READER SLOTS: The FP35B claims to read the following memory card formats:XD/CF I/CF II/MD/CF-Ultra II/CF Extreme/Micro Drive/UDMA CF/SD/SDHC/MMC/MMC II/MMC 4.0/MMC Micro (with adapter)/RS MMC/HS MMC/Mini SD (with adapter)/SD_Ultra II/Trans-Flash (with adapter)/Micro SD (with adapter)/MS/MS PRO/MS Duo/MS PRO Duo (MG)/MS PRO (MG)/MS(MG)/HS MS PRO(MG)/HS MS PRO DUO(MG)/MS PRO Ultra II/Memory Stick Micro (M2) (with adapter).I have only tested MMC and SDHC cards without problems.For testing, I copied a 2 GB folder with files big and small

I got top reading/writing speeds of 17 MB/second and 12 MB/second with a SanDisk SDHC 8 GB Extreme III card

During copying, my CPU utilization was 100%, which may suggest that on a system with a faster CPU, speeds will be better

Other card formats and brands might give different results

In fact, it seems that SDHC cards currently top at about 19/17 MB/second so my system is not performing that bad..


:)Sometimes the name of the card is not shown in Windows

For example, when I inserted the 8-GB SDHC card that I had named BETO8GIG, Windows Explorer didn't change its E: icon

But if I clicked it, the contents of the card was correctly displayed

On a different occasion, this same card correctly showed its name.The one thing you MUST be extremely aware when using these card reader slots is: NEVER use the System's Tray SAFELY REMOVE HARDWARE icon to remove memory cards from the slots!!! If you do, you will disable the card reader function and will have to reboot your computer to use it again


(This is certainly something I haven't seen happening with other card readers, and that shouldn't have to be with this one either...)


This is not documented on the manual, but is in the Q&A; area of the products web site.The proper way to remove a card is as follows:1- Open Windows Explorer (Start/All programs/Accesories/Windows Explorer).2- Open the "My PC" icon3- Select the removable device (card) you want to remove.4- Right click with your mouse and select the EXTRACT option from the pop-up menu.The card reader slots have an internal LED that glows green when not in use, and yellow when a card is properly inserted


When a card is EXTRACTED via windows explorer, the LED turns green meaning it is safe to remove the card.I wish the LED had been placed in a place visible from the outside


As it is, with a card inserted, it's almost imposible to see its glow, unless the room is dark.WHAT MAKES IT TICK?:I opened the unit to see what's inside

I may have voided my warranty so you don't have to.1394, audio, +5, +12 and e-Sata ports are just pass throughs of the internal headers, so it's almost impossible for them to give any trouble.USB header actually uses two USB ports.One is wired to the front USB port


The other powers the two card reader slots.Card reader functionality is provided by a Genesys Logic GL826 series chip, which is regarded by many as one of the best out there.It seems that older GL826 chips (Revision 9722 and older) had trouble with some memory cards, but later chips (Revision 9727 and later) are supposed to be fixed
My GL286 chip (as seen in photo) is version G09, was manufactured in year 2008 week 29 ("829"), and Windows sees its Revision as 9729.You can find out your product's revision in an easier way:1 - Insert a card in a slot2 - Open Device Manager (Start/Control Panel/System/Hardware/Device Manager)3 - Locate FP35B's Mass Storage Device among the USB controllers branch (There might be several entries in the list).4 - Right click with your mouse and select the PROPERTIES option from the pop-up menu

Click the DETAILS tab, and select Hardware IDs in the drop-down menu.5 - You will see a string like: USB\Vid_05e3&Pid;_0716&Rev;_9729
The Vid string denotes the manufacturing firm, and the Pid string denotes the model number


The numbers after REV_ are the revision number.CONCLUSIONMy final score: 4 out of 5 stars.It does everything promised, manufacturing quality is good, and has lots of features, so it's a good value.However, the non-standard behavior of the headphone jack and card reader, lack of visible LED, as described above, substracts from an otherwise great product.Side note: Did a quick test on Ubuntu 8.04.01: It works!!!Reviewed on May, 2009.

Our 6-yr-old wanted a camera so we gave her an old 3 megapixel one and she used it for a full year practicing her photography skills.  She never dropped it or lost it so now that she is nearly 8 she got this for Christmas.  We probably only use half of what it is capable of but it's fine for her and she just loves it.  She likes that its pink too so she can easily tell which is her camera.

Be aware of that.The box and the adapter looks a lttle bit cheap... once you open the box you will feel a toxic smell (3m tape).Even though... it works fine.

$REVIEW.: The Canon BG-E3 Battery Grip, extra Lithium batteries, an extra Canon charger (so I could charge 2 batteries at the same time), Canon UV lens filter and large Canon camera bag, were all of the add-on's, that I purchased right after Xmas 2007, when I got a Digital Rebel XT Camera, as a Xmas Gift! As an 'old school small & medium Format' photographer, I have been using a wide-spectrum of format camera's from 35mm to 2.25 to x-MP digitals. All of my photo gear is either a Nikon or a Cannon, except for a Hasselblad. You can read more on some of my other Reviews.Before, I begin I would like to note that there are many other excellent reviews already posted regarding this add-on Canon product.For the most part, when I have purchased parts, accessories or add-on's, for my camera(s),I usually put more 'weight' on the following criteria, rather than just buying some gadget for it's looks, some important questions like:* Function -  How is it going to affect my work-flow or productivity? A plus or minus or neutral?Will it be easy to operate?* Form - Does it bring together or combine to make the primary element a better one or give it an increased function? How does it do that?* Coolness factor - Yes, you gotta have it! If the add-on gives you the Perfect Balance of Form, Function + adds a Coolness factor, then you must have it!Since all of the Questions above have been answered here already on these Comment posts;One of my Favorite 'Coolness factors', among others, with this Canon Battery Grip, made for the Rebels and other Canon cameras, is that it really does give it both the Looks & Feel, of a more expensive Canon Pro camera's and that's a good thing!

$review_text.: The display on this digital frame is crisp and bright, and displays photos fairly well. I would consider 800x600 a minimum resolution for a screen this size. As I intend to use this for displaying pictures only, I didn't test the video or music functions.The initial settings are annoying; the thing automatically started a slide show with random cheesy screen-wipe effects, and file information permanently on-screen. I changed the settings to manual slideshow only, no info display, long delay, full-screen transition only.The location of the buttons on the frame mean you can't see the screen and the buttons at the same time... given the inclusion of a remote, this is a small issue. The buttons are oddly placed, though... left, right, Enter, up, down. This in a straight line from left to right... not exactly good interface design.Menu options were comprehensive and surprisingly feature-rich... no complaints there.The included colored frames are okay; in my opinion, the black looks rather flat and bland, while the cherry-wood colored frame gives the whole assembly more of an interesting look.The card support on this frame is excellent; support for all the standard card types, including xD, is definitely a bonus in my book.The included leaning stand is sub-par... it basically gives the frame a bent plastic peg to lean on, and the angle adjustments are limited. The option to hang it on a wall is welcome, but then you're stuck with the problem of what to do with the big wall wart on the end of the power cord.Hopefully this was specific to my particular order, but when I opened this up, the frame looked dusty and dirty, and there were clearly visible fingerprints on the plastic screen cover. The round plastic "seal" on the box was untouched as far as I could tell, but I suspect the occasional refurbished item may be slipping into the packaging line. The plastic cover is meant to be removed anyway, and everything seemed to be working fine, so I haven't bothered to seek an RMA.

$REVIEW.: I found this cable to be about what you'd expect for a Cat6 cable. It gets the job done, but it doesn't do anything extraordinary beyond what you'd expect from just about every other Cat6 cable out there. I do with they'd have at least done something with marking the cable so that it's more obvious what type it is, rather than just leaving us to hope that we remember.The short version is that if you already have older ethernet cables that you're using, it's probably not going to be worthwhile to switch them out unless there's something obviously wrong with them. Cat5 cables will do the job just fine for most home use because home Internet connections generally aren't so fast that the difference matters. In fact, if they hadn't offered me this as a review item I would still be using my Cat5 cable and leaving an upgrade to Cat6 on the 'someday' list. On the other hand if you're adding a new computer to your network or setting up a new network, the price difference is small enough that it's worth getting something like this so that you won't have to deal with the expense and hassle of going through an upgrade later if you find that you actually have a need for Cat6.

$review_text.: I have 2 computers that I use for watching TV (Windows Media Center + Ceton +Cablecard). Some content requires HDCP or a warning shows up on the screen, using a DVI to VGA adapter was a no go. I went for 1 of these, and I have to admit, for the price I didn't expect the quality to be as good as it was. It was so good I purchased a 2nd!It is very well made, does not feel flimsy at all. The chord is nice and thick, which was important for me, as my cat enjoys chewing on chords. The cable passes through the HDMI audio fine (a previous cable I purchased only supported video, no sound, and did not support HDCP either). The length was perfect for both situations. All in all, a good purchase.

$REVIEW.: I was plaqued by the modem provided by Comcast. Many times, I must unplug and re-plug to make it work, sometimes as many as 5 times a day! After installing this modem, I do not have to do this anymore.The modem is very easy to install, 5 minutes. And it works like a charm. It seems to be a bit faster than the one I previously rented from Comcast. I believe the speed can be further improved when I update my G router to N. With a rental charge of $5.00 a month on Comcast modem, I figure I can get back my investment in roughly 15 months, even though the price was a bit stiff.One thing bothers me though. The cover box of this unit has net-like opennings on all six sides including the side facing up. Will falling dusts affect its performance eventually? Why Motorola does not think of a product with at least the top side fully covered, I wonder.I am very happy about the unit and Amazon delivered this unit to me, free, in two days.

$review_text.: These speakers are cheap, decently powerful, and small.  But for just a little more, you could get theLogitech S220 2.1 Speaker System with Subwoofer, which adds a great, bargain subwoofer into the mix and an excellent volume control/headphone dial into the mix.PROS+ Decent, clear sound.  If you're an audiophile, these probably won't cut it-- but if you are, then you probably aren't even looking at this unit.  There's some distortion when you crank the volume up, but that's to be expected.+ Hardware volume controls are always a plus in my book.  The headphone jack in the unit is just a bonus (but make sure you turn the volume down on your computer first, because the dials do not control the headphone output!+ Small footprint means these guys will fit just about anywhere, limited by the length of the cord between them.+ Good volume for a cheap unit.  Enough said, really.CONS- The lack of a subwoofer compared to the marginally-more expensive ones I linked up top is the only real low point on this unit.  You get what you pay for, and if that's for a barebones 2.0 media setup, so be it.If this is what you need, buy with confidence.  If you want ot listen to more music and movies though, I'd go with the S220 instead.

$REVIEW.: I am a prime lens photographer. I own two 28mm, four diferent 50mm, an 85mm and a 135mm. Having said that, it's obvious the optic quality of this lens is far far away from my usual lens' pics.The main PROS would be it's build quality and the fast AF. I didn't think I would be so fast, but this weekend I took it to a soccer game with my 7D and it surprised the hell out of me!I would say sharpness and contrast are low at apertures wider than f/8, but you can correct that easily in Lightroom or any other software. If you pair it up with a camera that can manage high ISO, like the 7D or 5D, you've got yourself a great kit for daytime action photography.I wanted a tele so I could experiment on nature and sports photography, and you know what? It's great for that! I've got some awsome pics of wildlife and details, and you can work around its downsides. For the price it's more than ok, and it feels very tough too.

$review_text.: Using this 25 ft cable between a laptop and a 42" Samsung LCD. It was cheap, the quality of the cable is high (as pictures), and the signal seems just fine. I actually wouldn't be surprised if the 50 ft cable worked just as well. The only kind of negative which is actually a consequence of the cable being strong and durable, is it's not super flexible, at least not at first. It tries to stay in its spiral form really hard, so it's difficult to stretch it out straight. I just hooked it up last week though, and have barely messed with it, so I'm sure over time it'll "loosen up." In sum: low cost, high quality, durable cable that passes a perfectly-working signal even at 25 ft.

$REVIEW.: ****UPDATED REVIEW****Reduced to 1 star.Multiple attempts to get this working with the program "motion" on Ubuntu have failed.  I was able to extract the jpg URL from the web interface and have "motion" connect to the camera, but I could not get it to capture a complete image.  The pictures captured were corrupt jpgs (a portion of the picture appeared grey).My work on capturing images ended when this product began to fail completely.  First, the web interface would lock up (normally right after there something in the field of view moved).  Then it would fail to connect entirely.  Now, I cannot access the web interface at all and "motion" does not capture any images.  It took approximately 4 months for the camera to fail completely.Another negative on this camera.  Each camera has a dynamic DNS address associated with it - xxxXXXX.nwsvr.com (where xxx represents a 3 digit number and XXX 4 letters).  From what I remember, you cannot turn this off.  This could make it very easy for someone to identify IP addresses with cameras (just change one of the 3 digit numbers and there you go).  Given the relative simplicity of their web interface and security, it would not take long to write a little script that guesses the password on a given DDNS.  Meaning, there's a good chance someone could be watching you if you have one of these in your house (assuming your router is not blocking the port).  I didn't get a proof of concept working on this before the camera puked, but it was enough for me to go into my router and ensure ports were blocked to prevent this from communicating outside of my local network.I have not given up on the idea of using we cameras as a DYI security system.  But this camera (and the multiple re-branded versions of the same equipment) are off of my list.****ORIGINAL REVIEW****Originally 3 stars.Pros:- It is a $50 IP camera with pan, tilt, and night vision.- The IR "night vision" is fantastic for such a cheap camera.- The web "view" page gives you the functionality you need in a minimal interface.  Makes it quick and easy to manipulate the- The built in tools give you the basic functions you need to be aware of what is going on in your home.  Email alerts, ftp upload (of pictures only, no video uploads though), motion triggers, scheduled alarm times.Cons:-No security (https) for the web interface!  If you set up port forwarding, the entire world can see what ever your camera is pointed as, if they know your password (which is limited to 12 characters).  The problem here is, that your password is sent via plain text.  If someone manages to sniff the wifi packets (or picks up your traffic between the outside world and your router), then they will have your password and will be watching you.- No audio.  I haven't tried viewing using Internet Explorer (or Windows, for that matter) yet, but I have no audio on the web interface.  I'm leaving it at 3 starts because I really don't care about the audio, but since it is listed as a feature and isn't available on most browsers, I'm docking it a star.- Resolution limited to 640x480.- A user interface designed by engineers.  The user interface is the most basic possible while still providing the advertised functionality.  There is no polish here.  There are no help files.  If you don't understand what it is asking for, you're out of luck.  Do you know what what SSL for SMTP is?  If not, you're going to have trouble.- The focus ring is near impossible to adjust without completely blocking the lens.  Which means you give it a little turn, move your hand, wait for the picture, check it out, try again and hope to notice a difference.- No zoom (but it is a $50 camera).- The IR lights on the camera are very visible in the dark, so don't expect this camera to hide very well with the lights out.Overall:For what I paid, I'm happy with this camera.  It will serve the purpose for which it was purchased (security camera  for the house).  It gives a decent picture in the daylight and produces a night time picture which exceeded my expectations.  You can clearly make out faces (from approx 30ft away) in either lighting condition.I am fairly disappointed with lack of security on the web interface, and that the ftp function only captures pictures.  To fix both of these, I plan to discontinue using the built in functions and instead use a spare computer running Ubuntu and the program "motion" to handle the duties uploading motion captured video to my ftp site.  (The temptation to have a live view of the house may overcome my concerns over password security though, so the web interface may stay active.)Setup of the camera does require a slightly above average set of network skills, so be warned if you don't know what things like subnet mask and DDNS mean.I plan to purchase a few more of these to cover additional rooms of the house, and would recommend it to someone looking for a no-frills IP camera.

$REVIEW.: I have my share of experience with 3rd party grips with different camera bodies; zeikos for the D300 and D90, Vello for the D7000, Meike for the D800E. They all work great, cant really go wrong with $30-50 a pop (except the Vello which cost a bit more at $80). Way cheaper than the factory, holds up well, and works like it should. They all feel cheap, but that is expected since they are all pretty much alike across brands, for the price you paid for you really can't complain, as long as they work. In my experience so far Vello has the closest feel to the real thing, at least for the D7000. The dials have a grippy feel to them, and is built well and everything seems to fit seamlessly. And since Vello is one of the pricier options among the line ripoff party grips, I can understand why it feels better.So this time I am trying out my D600 grip with the Xit.Out of the box it looks just like the real thing, in the small details and shape of the grip. It has some weight (perhaps it even has metal inside I am not sure), pretty well built, has a metal alignment pin and fits great. Its rubber grips feels very similar to the Nikon, and that's definitely a plus. The button feels good as well. The shutter feels ok. However, if you look closer, imperfections start showing up. I see tiny crevices in the way the grip is put together, meaning it's not molded very fit and each piece of plastic doesnt fit perfect. The dials are cheap just like any other make, the rubber grip in one curvy section has difficulty fitting perfectly thus it looks as if it's peeling off a tiny bit, and lastly the battery tray of ENEL15 fits into the chamber slightly out of misalignment causing the locking pin to lock kind of tight. If you stress it too much, I am afraid one day the pin will snap off and then there's no way to lock in your battery.This grip is currently selling at $90, so it's definitely not the cheapest knockoff grip around. I would say I expect better for $90, because I am sure the meike zeikos would work perfect and despite feeling very cheap, not have these misalignment issues. I have a feeling the Vello might be a better choice than this, perhaps. So my initial impressions of this grip, they did a good job of copying the grip to make it look alike, but the craftsmanship is not there to put it together, unlike other makes which doesnt even try to micmic the original design (my D800E Meike is like 1/4" fatter in all directions from the original grip) just to keep costs down.This is the only 3rd party grip I have for D600, honestly I do not want to bother trying out different brands so use your own judgement. This works well and that's good enough for me. I know I will be ok with a $40 grip but just want to give XIT a try since it's priced higher. I do like its grippy feel and how it looks, just it was not put together that nicely.Update 2/2013Ok after owning it for a few days, I found out a MAJOR problem with my grip. Maybe it just happens that I got a lemon, so I cant say for other copies. My dial skips, meaning you can adjust the dials but they dont correspond to the camera correctly. This is not acceptable so it's going back to Amazon. This is a first time I get such a defect from a 3rd party grip. So I guess that's the end of my review as I would be switching to another brand and stick with it as long as it works properly.

I've to say this is by far the best way to explore music, movie, and podcast. Of cause, Zune Pass really pays off too.I am also surprised by the HD Radio function. It is sometimes a fun way of taking a break away from Zune MarketPlace, and just to enjoy other stuffs. Since I also bought a Bose OE headphone, I thought the I won't be able to enjoy HD Radio since it requires Zune's own headphone (someone told me that the HD Radio antenna is built-in as part of the headset). I am happy to find out that it actually works well with my Bose headphone. I guess the antenna maybe inside the Zune device somewhere.I want to say it is good to be different sometimes.

I chose a corded one since cordless ones tend to cost a bit, especially those of high quality. When this one arrived i was surprised at how nice it looked even though it is black. I liked the smooth and simple design of it, and the length of the cord. When I plugged it in, and the software downloaded, I gave it a test run and it passed with flying colors. It moved easily up, down, back and forth, and clicked easily. I had no trouble opening up files or coping and storing images. Once I accomplished that, I unplugged it and went back to my cordless, knowing that when I need it, the corded mouse will fill the bill perfectly, and at a very low price.

$review_text.: We bought this last year before going on a cruise.  Follow the simple instructions. Lightly grease the O-ring (with the included tube of silicone grease) before each use and you're good to go.  So far it has been perfect for swimming, snorkeling, boating, rainy day hiking, and keeping the sand and salt spray out of the camera on the beach.  We always wait until we get back to fresh clean water, rise, and blot dry, before opening it and have never had a problem.  Also, ALL of the camera controls are remoted thru the case so the is no loss of function with your camera.One peripheral consideration is that we have experimented with a wide variety of batteries for our electronics and will never use anything other than the Energizer E2's.  the have over double the life of any other battery we have tried in our electronics.

$REVIEW.: I built a bookshelf speaker cabinet for some 6.5&#34; Polk car speakers I had laying around from my old boat to use at my desk at work. I needed an amp and for the price I had to try this thing out. It sounds better than I thought. I have to keep at a fairly low volume level as it is at work but it sounds way better than purchased desktop speakers. I did turn it up at home in my basement before taking to work and the setup got pretty loud and still sounded clean.

$REVIEW.: These are genuine Sony replacement pads, just like the original
After practicing the installation using my old pads I found that you should start at the top of the earcup (narrow part)

From there it should be fairly easy to get about half-way down the sides

At this point you will have to do some stretching to get the rest of the material around the cup
This can be a little worrisome as it might feel like you're man-handling it, but apparently it can take it

Try alternating a little on each side and remember to use your finger and thumb to keep both sides in place while you're doing it.

I just reused the same one over and over until I got it to look OK

It's still not perfect, but it's usable, so I keep it on


I haven't tried any other brand, so I don't know that it's the brand or just the concept that leaves the bubbles

I probably wouldn't buy again, though.

$REVIEW.: I bought this TV on Amazon after doing a ton of research on Consumer Reports, CNET and lots of other review web-sites.  I ended up paying about $700 less than if I had got it at Best Buy (when you add in the sales tax I didn't have to pay).  I was originally interested the 65" Samsung they had at Costco that was an LED.  Funny enough the LED was much more expensive than the plasma.  According to CNET the plasma has a more even picture.  Well since I don't have the tools to measure the picture I just had to take their word for that.  I got the Plasma because it was much cheaper (if you can believe that) and have not been disapointed with regular viewing.  The picture quality on Blu-ray is way beyone what was expected.  The new Tron movie is so sharp and clear it is spooky.  You can't watch that movie without being totally amazed.  I do have a gripe but not one big enough to not give this 5 stars.  The 3D picture is darker and not as sharp, than the non-3D.  Clearly it is because of the shaded glasses.  This isn't much of an issue for me because 3D was just something this TV did, not the reason I bought it.  I wanted the most amazing picture I could find for a reasonable price.  I believe I got just that.  Also, I think this is the best looking TV out there.  Kudos to the Samsung engineers for getting such an amazing picutre in such a small area (the thickness is amazing) and the outside bezel size is minute.  Love this TV.

$review_text.: I bought an iPad 2 and was looking for a screen protector which  would not only protect my screen from scratches but also keep away finger print smudges. This screen protector did just that and more. The anti glare feature works and no longer am I staring at my own reflection. Putting on the protector was an ease. For those having problems with application  just head to your bathroom and spray the bathroom with a water spray bottle. That should take care of pesky dust particules getting in between the film and screen during application. Overall this is a great accessory for your iPad and you get the benefit of receiving two instead of one.

I had one just like this one, just a different color. I sold it to a friend and I purchased a Coolpix.  That camera is ok. but the picture quaility is not so good. I looked for a better camera and purchased a small kodack camera, didn't like the the digital zoom, not enough zoom. So, I decided to look for a camera just like I had before I sold it, because I knew the picture quaility was great, so I found this one and was so pleased to find one like the one I had earlier. This is really a great little camera, won't sell this one!!!!!

$REVIEW.: I got this drive to replace the 320GB drive my 24" iMac came with to store more photos on.  What I got was not only a ton of storage space but a significant boost in speed!  The OS boots up much faster than before and my applications (even poky Photoshop) open super fast now!  This drive does run a lot hotter than my old one.  In iMacs there is a thermistor attached to the hard drive which controls the fan, and you'll want to make sure you re-attach it to this drive when you swap them.  The review at Tom's Hardware says it runs at 114 (46C) and I notice my Mac's fan kicking on a lot more than with the old drive.This drive came packaged well.  Like others have said, large outer box with sealed air cushions, inner box with foot suspensions, etc.  This is the 5th HDD I've ordered from Amazon and they have all come this way.  The other 4 I've had running in a Drobo for over a year with no issues.  I don't blame folks for returning shoddily packed items, I would too.  I've been lucky with Amazon on these.  The origin point for all of my drives was Lexington, KY - so they must know what they're doing at that facility when it comes to packaging.

$review_text.: The features of this product are great...the problem is the clock constantly freezes and/or locks up.  Twice the alarm did not go off because the clock had frozen.  I returned the product for a replacement thinking maybe I got a dud.  Well the replacement does the same thing.  So I emailed the company to see what could be done.  Three suggestions were given:1.  Make sure you are using the iPhone dock adapter (well duh)2.  Turn the power off before inserting the phone (well ok but not sure how this would help the clock freezing in the future...it wasn't freezing when I was putting the phone in).3.  Power cycle the clock to reset...(ok I do this EVERY time it freezes).So bottom line works great to listen to music...but if you need a clock or an alarm (which is probably why you are looking at an ALARM CLOCK) then this is unreliable and completely useless...just like the company's support.

I used; CPU: i3-3225, memory: Crucial Single 8GB DDR3, CT102464BF160B, HDD: WD Black 160GB SATA, DVD: Toshiba TS-L633 8x DVDRW DL Notebook SATA. I obtained adapter for SATA to slimlineSATA(StarTech), since it was recommended by amazon with Toshiba DVD drive. Shuttle XH61V came with slimeline SATA so that that Startech adapter was not needed. (Somehow the slimline SATA was not mentioned in Shuttles information available). I am running Win7(64). It is fast enough to use for my office work without extra graphic card. Compare to the micro-ATX system in small factor case I have been using, the installation of the memory was a bit tight. Otherwise, putting parts together was very easy. USB 3 support was very nice. The machine is very quiet and amazingly compact. If you do not need to install additional cards, I will highly recommend this.  I hope next model has SATA 3 support.

$REVIEW.: I currently use a much smaller "sling" style bag, which is the Vanguard Pampas 47

It is a great bag for when you are on the move, out for maybe 1-3 hours at a time, OK with a limit amount of lenses, and want to get the camera out quickly (hence the sling option)

With kids along though it isn't always up to the task of holding all the toys, treats, drinks, clothing, etc......Also if you want some extra lenses, flashes, etc...


it runs out of room quickly.The Orion daypack is light weight and seems to be of decent build quality but isn't overbuilt
Designed more for the urban adventure then roughing it out in the elements
It is about twice the size of my Vanguard bag and has two traditional over the shoulder straps, vs


the single sling of the smaller bag
The straps and back are padded for comfort
Like the Vanguard bag, the bottom is where you would store your camera body, lenses, and flashes

(feels like 1/2" foam for the protection on all sides) It doesn't open on the side so you cannot cheat like with the sling bag by only partially removing the bag to get your camera out
You will need to take it off, unzip it and get your items out


The area for camera and lenses has some velcro dividers which you can move around to fit your needs

If you looking to get one of the big Canon zooms in there, you won't be getting your body in the lower part though


It is designed for smaller to midsized lenses.The upper part has similar spacing as the lower, just no dividers and one small internal mesh "pocket"


Perfect for a light jacket, food, etc...
It has zippered side pockets for small items like a phone you might want to have quick access to( up top) and mesh pockets (on the bottom sides)

It also has a two cinch straps underneath you could put a small tripod in with or secure a jacket


It has extensions that go over the zipper welds (for moisture protection) but I don't think I will be trusting them enough based on their look and feel to be comfortable having this out in inclement weather.Weight is listed at 1.3 pounds.Inner Dimensions of camera compartment: 11W x 6D x 6.9HInner Dimensions of upper compartment:  12W x 5D x 9HOverall nice dedicated camera lower pack with more traditional upper storage
Will be replacing my vanguard bag on more extended outings, or short outgoing where I need to haul more stuff or need more flash, battery, and lens choices

Great for my needs and I would recommend.

$REVIEW.: I don't have this card. I've got a generic 6870 card. But I just wanted to chip in my 2 cents to say what a great chip this is. I'm usually an Nvidia fan. I only got ATI because eyefinity supports 3+ monitors.I was a little hesitant. First, I understood that it wasn't going to be that simple (it wasn't). Second, I didn't think this card would have the horsepower to drive three monitors.First, as far as hooking up 3 monitors - absolutely simple if you've got at least 1 monitor w/ a display port input. If you don't, you must use one displayport output from your card (the other two, I believe can be HDMI OR DVI OR VGA). Seems simple. Not so. You must buy an ACTIVE displayport to DVI (or HDMI or whatever) adapter. Try to use a regular one, it won't work (though it works fine if you're only driving 2 monitors). Once I got my active mini-displayport to DVI connector, I plugged that and the other 2 DVI connectors into my 3 monitors and they started up no problem.Second, the pleasant surprise, the 6870 does seem to have enough horsepower to run several late model games if you don't turn the details up too high. This might require trial and error with the built in benchmarking features of the games. As an example, dirt 2 runs fine. And GTA IV is AMAZING when run on this. I played before, but never properly appreciated the level of detail until you get a 180 degree panoramic view of Liberty City.If you want to run on 5760 x 1080, you'll have to group your monitors using the ATI Catalyst program that comes with the card. This will make your computer think of the screen as one giant monitor. Unfortunately, this means if you maximize a window, it'll cover all three monitors. Further, the start button and active windows will sit on your leftmost monitor. As will the default icons. The time and notifications will sit on the right. Honestly, if you're not going to play games, you're probably better off with the standard 3 monitor solution.Anyway, for people wanting a cheap 3 monitor rig, I think this is the lowest you want to go. And I understand, if you need additional horsepower, crossfire in a second 6870 for serious horsepower.I'm really happy with my rig. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to get back to my gaming.

$REVIEW.: I am writing this review on my Lenovo Yoga 13 which I got because I could not quite pull the trigger on the Microsoft Surface Pro. I had a Surface RT for a while and loved it, but I needed a little more power and stability for my work computer.With this Keypad and the Transformer TF300T, I have almost the perfect 10 inch setup at an affordable price. I can do meaningful work with the keyboard attached or put it away when I just need the tablet. When attached, the keyboard folds up over the screen just like the Surface so the combined unit travels very well.

$review_text.: Caveat: Calling me an amateur is an insult to amateurs.I bought this for a specific purpose: taking (relatively) low light candid pictures of two very fast moving granddaughters
 For that purpose, the camera is superb


 The only problem is the position of the pop-up flash


 It's placed exactly where one's left index figure would optimally be positioned for a good grip on the camera

 For 90% of my use, I'm not using the flash, so that's not a big deal for me
 Perhaps there's something I'm missing--but I can't get around the fact that holding a camera the way I normally would results in flash suppression.

Our laptop is not a MacBook, so it is too large for that sleeve, too bad.  I might use it for the iPad, but seems large to carry that one thing, and I would never put the phone and the iPad in the same case.  It just seems like it screams, "here, all of my devices are easy to steal all at once." A little paranoid, I admit, but it does seem like it would be heavy to carry if it were full.

$review_text.: It's an FM encoder, not a direct digital or analog connection to the car's head unit, so one's expectations on sound quality should be set appropriately.  Also, be sure to set the volume on the iPod/iPhone to around 75-80%, not higher, to avoid clipping.  I suspect that many who complain about these units have the source volume cranked.  It may also help to lay the cable out over the console/dash, as it's the antenna too -- experiment with conformations to find one that works best for your situation.If you want superior sound, get an Alpine head unit that your player can plug into directly.

$REVIEW.: Provides good protection for the camera thrown into a briefcase (though the leather case itself is so nice it cries out for its own protection!).  A neoprene case would be more practical, but this fits my needs.  When carrying the camera, I use the belt loop to carry the case, with the wrist strap on the camera.  Note that I have the DMC-LX3 and it is a perfect fit even with the auto lens cap - the LX5 has a slightly larger lens diameter and I would guess that with the auto lens cap the fit might be a problem.  May not be genuine leather, but good enough to fool me!  Had  a leather smell, but not objectionable and disappeared over time.

$review_text.: These CD/DVD sleeves are a great idea - I love the fact that they are made in the USA from 100% recycled materials (85% post-consumer) and are themselves completely recyclable.  I even like the appearance - flecks of slightly different shades of brown in the cardboard, and the logo on the back embossed rather than printed with ink.I have to knock off a point for the construction and cost.  The back panel is solid, and is attached via 3/4" flaps on either side.  But, rather than gluing these flaps to the outside of the sleeve which would have given a 100% smooth, protecting surface inside, the flaps  are glued to the inside of the sleeve.  The sleeve is more attractive with this design, but its main function should be to protect the inserted media I think.  The cost at the time of this writing is double that of plastic jewel cases, and six times the cost of plastic sleeves.  That seems too high of a price premium for being "green".Kudos to ReBinder for this environmentally friendly made-in-the-USA product.

$REVIEW.: Small External HD Case BlackI bought this case to protect my Western Digital 250 GB portable USB hard drive, as I move the drive around a lot between home and work
I'm using the hard drive to back up my iTunes music collection, so I want to take care of it, hence I purchased this Case Logic case

The case is easy to use
When you open it up, you'll find two compartments (one on each side)
One has an elastic strap that snuggly holds your hard drive in position
The other compartment has a mesh flap which acts like a pocket, so you can have a space to put a USB cable and maybe a flash drive or two in a pinch

As the case is small, it isn't really designed such that you can leave the hard drive in the case during operation
There isn't enough room for the connector to fit when it is placed in the drive, without the cable putting undue stress on the connector (not a good idea - duh!)


In any event, the hard drive produces some heat during operation, so you probably wouldn't want to leave it in the case anyway
My only two complaints or observations are that a real hand strap could have been provided instead of the rubber thingy for carrying the drive more safely to and from a car, and that there isn't really a lot of padding in the sides of the case

I still wouldn't want to drop the hard drive while in the case onto concrete


Maybe from 3 feet onto carpet would be survivable


I guess I expected it to be lined with some styrofoam (I won't tell Al Gore) to provide more protection

Still, it does provide a nice place to keep your hard drive and cable together, without them getting all scratched up.

$review_text.: I bought this keyboard to use with my Raspberry Pi, which is connected to a television for media playback


I needed something that I could use while sitting on the couch.For the price, the keyboard performs as expected
There is nothing remarkable about it


It's simply functional


The trackpad is not very accurate or sensitive

But it's more than good enough to be useful


I've not tried the multi-touch features since I really have no use for them.When used with the Raspberry Pi, the USB transceiver needs to be plugged in *after* the Pi has booted up
Otherwise, input will be erratic -- key presses will either not register, or will repeat until another key is pressed

This is the only real quirk I've found with this keyboard.The build quality of the keyboard is somewhat poor

There is significant flex if torsional pressure is applied
It feels like it could break easily

This doesn't actually bother me much since I don't use keyboards as structural supports
At least it is lightweight and fairly compact with a fairly low profile.If you're looking for a main keyboard that you will use for awhile each day..

look elsewhere
For casual/secondary use, the Perixx PERIBOARD-716 is a decent option.

Set up and pairing was a breeze, plus it matches the color and finish of my wireless keyboard
It does not look like a piece of plastic, it connects seamlessly with my keyboard

Alot of the negative reviews seem to be from 2011 and earlier in 2012, so am thinking that they must have came out with a more recent model which is what I have

I like that fact that it goes to sleep when my iMac does

$review_text.: Purchased this directly from Bose
 Was excited to hook it all up, only to find out the unit wouldn't even power on
 Tried hooking everything up again, same thing

 Called tech support from Bose....was on hold for over 10 minutes before I reached someone
 The extent of their tech support was tell me to unplug everything, leave it unplugged for a minute, and then plug all the cables back in
 After this, I was told he would send me another replacement receiver to see if that one will work
 Of course the warehouse is closed, which means it won't ship till Friday, and I won't get the part till Monday.Also what was frustrating is Bose ships this by UPS but if your not home during delivery, you can't even request that the package be held at your local UPS location


 It either has to be signed for in person, or you have to sign the tracking notice giving UPS permission to leave it at your door

 Very inconvenient, lucky my front door is shielded from public view.After looking online, I have seen a lot of internet posts were people have been having the same kinds of problems
 Either it will just power up into standby mode and the remote won't turn it on, or it won't have any power at all like mine
 Even when I get the replacement part, I'm really considering sending this back for a less expensive home audio system, like Onkyo or something
 Very disappointing and frustrating.****UPDATE****Got the replacement part, the unit still won't power on so obviously the subwoofer is bad


 Bose said they could exchange it, but I wouldn't get my new unit for about 5-7 business days


 Screw that, I'm sending it back for a full refund

 I may still buy this in the future, but definitely at a local store so I can exchange it right away, or even through Amazon through Prime shipping.

$review_text.: I'm slow getting this in but on the other hand the product has been tested half to death.  Verdict: Great but not perfect.As the good far, far outnumbers the bad let me say you can assume anything not mentioned - sound quality, screen readability, GPS finding satellites, etc. - is excellent.  Now the disappointments.  I loaded nearly 12 gigs of music onto an SD card and play the music all the time.  The loading of playlists are slow but it doesn't affect music quality in the least.  Because the music is played through a weak FM signal if the FM antenna is located away from the front windshield of the vehicle the unit is subject to lots of interference.  The Bluetooth links the unit to the car sound system nicely but if you take the phone away from the car (out of range) when you get back it needs to have the link reestablished, and that means restarting the Garmin.  The same can happening with your music under some rare circumstances.  I'm not sure what causes it but I can see the music being played on the screen but no sound???  There's nothing for it but to restart the Garmin.The newer generation Garmin's do not have all the features of this 765T.  Too bad for them.  With the lifetime maps package I have updated the maps a few times and feel I am way ahead in the game.If this unit broke I'd buy another 765T in a heartbeat.

$review_text.: Manforotto puts out consistently


The quality of this stand compared to the price leader Wescott which I also have is worth the cost if your in it for the long haul

The stand is really really light weight so if your going to extend it all the way (with a SB-900 or a reflector) your going to need to sandbag the base of the stand

If its windy and I'm not going to have to hike to far I really prefer the Manfrotto 1004BAC which is much sturdier and easier to weigh down.

$REVIEW.: Purchased this unit with the idea of only using it once or twice to load software on a netbook. The unit is too cheap to take seriously, but it should work at least once. It didn't on any computer, with any operating system. Never, not once, a dud, completely useless. Of course we get what we pay for, but I thought--well one use, but no, it was too cheap for that.While I am sure Amazon will take it back, it is not worth the return postage, so into the garbage it goes. Save your money and get something that may work.

After those are packed and the camera is placed in the main compartment, I feel that its rather too snug. I haven't had any damage to my camera or lenses but I am extra careful with the case now. Price is on the higher side but this case came highly reviewed so I will stick with it for now.

$review_text.: Years ago I started using IBM's line of hard disks to cut failure rates
 I have IBM drives with 1/2 million spinning hours logged and no failures in a  recent low level reformat to build a 20TB NAS RAID

 Hitachi for a while was producing the IBM drives and finally bought out that division of IBM, but kept the quality in the product.In the same load of that raid-5 systemSynology 5-Bay Plug-n-Use Expansion Unit to DS1010+ and DS710+ Network Attached Storage DX510 (Black)the old IBM drives were loaded side by side with two new WD 2.0 GB drives and the entire 5 drive system was given a low level format


 In the logfile, the two WD drives had multiple (>100) read errors and a few (>30) bad sectors while the ancient IBM discs had zero failures
 In the main box I had bought some of these Hitachi units and found they also did a low level format with zero errors.While I don't want to speculate on why IBM left the diskdrive business, their legacy of reliability, speed, and capacity has proven their overall value in preserving data for years without problems
 Today I insist on using hitachi's IBM legacy mechanism in new computers or raid storage arrays because out of 40+ IBM style drives in use both in on/off environments and constant spinning environments, none have failed.There are free tools on the internet that will let you read your drive's "log" of errors - I highly recommend not only the hitachi disk systems but this software for reading the s.m.a.r.t


memory in the drives you have to predict future reliability or failures


 While all mechanical devices eventually die, keeping track of subtle failure hints is important.

$review_text.: So I have the MBP 13&#34; with Retina Display. This keyboard cover perfectly and it molds around the keys like a condom that fits on a banana. The protector does come up a bit around the edges which isn't annoying if you're not looking at it but I actually like the bouncy feeling that you get from the protector gives you and I don't mind the edges coming up when hitting the side keys as it does what its meant to do which is protector the keyboard for liquid and lint. It also appears to be re-usable that that's a plus too. All in all I would give this protector a 5 star rating since it does do exactly what it's meant to do. I'm not going to be so harsh on the product like some people who think that you don't have to sacrificing some inconvenience to gain convenience to something else. What's most important to you? the keyboard coming up a tiny little bit or it fitting nearly perfect and protecting the keys from oil, dust/dirt, spills and whatever else that you might throw at it. It will preserve the cleanliness of the keys so when you're ready to upgrade the keys will still look brand new, just the way I like it. I don't understand why anyone would give this product anything less than a 5 star rating. It does everything it is designed to do, if you think you can do better and still sell it at the same price. Please post it on Amazon and I might think about buying it. That's all I have to say. Oh and PS. As you are typing the keys actually soften up and molds better because of the warmth coming up through the keys which could be a good or bad thing. Just a little extra that I wanted to throw in there.

$review_text.: I am not biased, but I have worked at a Micron R&D facility, and I see the level of quality brought to each product offering.  I constantly refresh my knowledge base with tech rollouts, and Micron (Crucial) is always a front-runner.  Intel is also right up there, but that makes sense since Micron was previously a part of Intel.  If the chipset is Marvell, then odds are you have yourself a winner.  The speeds are as advertised, if not exceeded, and the build quality cannot be beat.  I highly recommend Crucial, Micron, and this product line.  If you would like the latest offering, try the M550 series.  It will get you a boost in speed, coupled with added features and benefits.

This sounds just as good but is a third of the size! It's perfect for having in the backyard while my niece and I do some gardening


My brother even uses it in his car since his car radio only gets AM stations


The best is because it's so small, it's perfect for using in the bathroom while I enjoy a hot bath


Nothing is better than a hot bubble bath and the beautiful sound of Stravinsky playing softly
The sound is clear and crisp
The bass is amazing without that annoying vibration sound


I would recommend this speaker set over the larger speakers


Same sound quality with a smaller footprint.

$REVIEW.: We recently upgraded from a 42" 1080p LG LCD TV that we purchased several years ago to the LG 55" 1080p 3D Smart LED TV. Let me first start of by saying that our old TV is still going strong and I have never had a problem with it. We own quite a few LG products and we have found the brand to be reliable and well made. While my old TV was top of the line several years ago it already seems like ancient technology compared to the LG 55LB7200 55" 1080p 3D Smart LED TV. I will list some of the best features about this TV below.The first big improvement on this TV is the size of the border around the screen. My old TV has a section around the TV screen that was about two inches wide. This TV is basically all screen and that's all you see. The screen goes edge to edge on the top and sides. There is about 1 mm of high quality metal framing. On the bottom there is about  an inch of black frame because there is s power indicator light installed in that section and several buttons as well.This TV weighs in at 41 lbs. which is expected for a TV this size. It's extremely thin so it looks very professional if you choose to mount it on the wall. Our last TV was sitting on an entertainment stand but this TV was too large to fit on the stand. So we decided that it would be best to wall mount it. There are tons of different wall mounts but most of them have one thing in common and that it how expensive they are. We decided to save some money and go with theCheetah Mounts APTMM2B Flush Tilt (1.3" Profile) TV Wall Mount Bracket for 32-65 inch LED, LCD and Plasma Flat Screen TVs Up To VESA 684x400 and 165lbs, Including a Twisted Veins 10' Braided High Speed with Ethernet HDMI Cable and a 6" 3-Axis Magnetic B.... This wall mount is rated very good on Amazon with thousands of reviews. We are extremely happy with our decision to purchase this wall mount. It's not only one of the least expensive wall mounts that I have seen but it's also one of the best. The wall mount is excellent quality and the instructions are easy to understand. It also includes every nut, bolt and screw you could possibly need. It took a little work but this TV looks awesome mounted on my wall and I am glad that I did it. If you choose to sit this TV on the floor or on an entertainment stand it does come with sturdy legs that are chrome on the front. They look nice if you prefer not to wall mount it. If you intend to mount it on the wall you may want to hide the wires that are coming out of the bottom of the TV. I purchased theLegrand C30LG Flat Screen TV Cord Cover Kitand installed it below my TV. Once installed you can put all of the wires inside and snap the cover into place and it really gives it a professional appearance.The IPS panel on this TV makes viewing at any angle equally good. We have family over a couple times a month to watch movies and this TV is much better for living room full of people. I usually have to be directly in front of the TV but that is much less of a problem since we upgraded to this TV.This smart TV can do it all. It has built-in WiFi and an ethernet port if you prefer a wired connection. It has an internet browser that is easy to navigate and use. The internet browser looks a lot like google chrome with favorites and quick links to recently accessed pages. It also has a smart remote that has a pointer on the screen similar to a computer mouse. It automatically updates the software in it each time that you turn the TV on. It's used for changing channels, volume, settings, apps, games and everything. It has built-in voice recognition so you can push a button and talk to it and it will follow certain commands. It seems to understand what I am saying about 90% of the time which is pretty good in my opinion. It's also easy to program so it will control your cable box or other devices like a blu-ray player after the initial set up. The remote is really excellent with one minor exception. Like I said before every time you turn the remote on it will check for a remote update. This causes a delay of about 10-15 seconds sometimes before you can control the TV. It's not a huge deal but it can be annoying at times.There are tabs for all your favorite movie streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu Plus, Vudu Movies & TV and Amazon Instant Video. The tabs are there by default but it will still need to install the app the first time you run it and it will need to occasionally need to run an update to the software. Once you are set up there apps are quick and easy to use.There are also tabs for YouTube and Skype as well.  The YouTube app is well organized and easy to find your favorite videos. It has many different tabs so you can easily flip through to different categories. Then there is the LG store where you can download both free apps like Pandora and Crackle and many other of your favorite apps. There are many other apps that you can purchase.There are games that you can download directly to your TV that you mostly have to pay for but there are occasionally free games like Air Traffic Control that I have been hooked on playing lately. Most of the good games you will have to pay for though.There are regular movies, high definition movies and 3D high definition moves that you can view, rent or purchase. Select titles will be free from time to time but most of them you will have to pay for. Surprisingly there are some cool 3D shows for kids for free like several about dinosaurs, planes and nature.Visually speaking this TV is stunning in HD. I have never seen a better picture on any TV regardless of the price. My last TV had the same 1080p resolution but this TV looks much better and brighter. The colors are so much more vivid and lifelike looking.This TV is 3D compatible and comes with 2 pairs of passive 3D glasses. These are the type that don't take batteries of have power cords and they are just black lenses not the old fashioned blue and red lenses. We have a family of four plus we always have people over to watch movies so two pairs of glasses wasn't enough for us. The glasses aren't very expensive to purchase extra pairs so it's not that big of a deal. I used to think that 3D technology was never going to be mainstream because of the added cost. However we purchased a couple movies recently in 3D includingMarvel's The Avengers (Four-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray/DVD + Digital Copy + Digital Music Download)andThe Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray + DVD + Digital HD UltraViolet Combo Pack)and the effects were wicked when watching the movies on this TV. I have watched some good 3D movies at the movie theater before but didn't think they could look so good at home. This TV absolutely proves that it can product excellent 3D picture and really bring the movie out to you.I would say that this TV is pretty standard when it comes to the audio and video inputs that are on the back. This is a list of the available ports and plugs.3 HDMI 1.4 Ports3 USB 2.0 Ports1 Component and Composite set of ports1 Optical Cable Port1 PC AudioEthernet Port1 Headphone PortAs an added bonus when you purchase this TV before August 16th 2014 you will receive a one year gift subscription to Netflix. This is a great little perk and it's easy to redeem. All you have to do is register online and upload pictures of your receipt and the back of the TV where it lists the serial number and model number. Once you do that they will send you a gift code that you enter online to redeem. I think Netflix is currently about eight bucks a month so this is a big bonus. I like Netflix so this was a nice little perk that we can enjoy all year long.Overall I couldn't be more pleased with this TV and find it hard to believe that are so many poor reviews on it. I can only speak for myself but I have had no problems at all.

$REVIEW.: At the risk of getting booed off of the page I have to admit that I do not have an Ipad2. This case is well made, but from viewing comments from those with the Ipad2 which is what it was supposed to be designed for, it gets an F for functionality. So I did some research, and the best two cases garnering the top reviews here at Amazon, come in leather, and are as follows;Bear Motion (TM) 100% Genuine Leather Case for iPad 2 2nd Generation Folio with 3-in-1 built-in Stand for Apple iPad 2 (Latest Generation) Tablet [Leather case enclosed in blue sleeve]Snugg iPad 2 Leather Case Cover and Flip Stand with Elastic Hand Strap and Premium Nubuck Fibre Interior (Black) - Automatically Wakes and Puts the iPad 2 to Sleep. Superior Quality Design as Featured in Wired Magazine.If you are looking to save a little money, here is a another top choice in faux leather;CaseCrown Apple iPad 2 Bold Standby case (Black) for iPad 2 (Built-in magnet for Apple Smart Cover's sleep & awake)Case Logic has been one of my favorite case mfrs and this case it very well built and seems like it would hold up to constant use and abuse. The only problem is that if it is not engineered properly for its primary purpose it doesn't serve the need well. I hope the links are helpful.

$REVIEW.: LCD/LED monitors today generally fall into one of two categories:  1.) cheap, basic units that offer nothing in the way of physical adjustments, and 2.) expensive models with lots of frills. What's available in the second category has become increasingly limited, and the price difference compared to cheaper units can be hard to justify. The ViewSonic VA2342-LED was a good compromise for me. Color and picture quality are excellent, and while the stand is typically flimsy and unadjustable, the unit comes with VESA mounting capability. The 3-year warranty and dead pixel guarantee is a bonus.I'm a web designer and developer, so color and picture quality are critical to me. As I stated above, both are excellent with the VA2342 and I'm very pleased. The picture is sharp and bright, color is vibrant but not overly saturated, and text looks great. I spent a few minutes with the Windows 7 color and ClearType calibration tools to arrive at these optimized results, but it was painless and quick. Like all LCD/LED screens manufactured today, there's an optimum viewing angle the user must determine when placing this monitor. I considered a dual monitor stand for maximum adjustability, but I settled on a sleek glass shelf to raise the displays about two inches off my desktop and it's perfect. I'll post some pics soon which will hopefully be helpful to others. On the downside, the OSD is quirky but no worse than most others I've had to deal with.I split my design and dev time between my home office and an offsite workstation, where I'm stuck with two 22" Dell UtraSharps. My new ViewSonics are a huge step up in picture quality by comparison.

$REVIEW.: I came to the C70 from the SilverStone FT03 Fortress.  As far as PC cases go, the Fortress was unique and stylish but NOT portable even with the special bag SilverStone sells just for it.  Picking the Fortress up and moving it around almost guarantees one or both side panels will become dislodged and the flimsy plastic grill on the top isn't enough to hold the whole thing together as you wrestle it into the bag.  Enter the C70.  The handles are no joke, they're sturdy and I don't worry they'll come loose.  The "ammo can" look totally works for me, now that I've put aside my preference for an attractive PC case and focused on my need to be able to regularly transport the case around for remote set-ups.  Doing the build was also a breeze too.  It's not hard to get your hands into the case, which was simply not possible with the Fortress.  My one problem with the C70 so far is that it comes without screens for the top or the sides(if you use them.)  If you're looking for a portable case, look no further.  Having been in the military I can tell you that scratches and abrasions only make olive drab paint look even better.

$review_text.: The TP-Link 5-Port Gigabit desktop switch TL-SG1005D is purported to be eco-friendly, and so will keep it online in order to save up to 70% in energy. I'm not seeing any increases in performance per se, however I think that's because the speeds we're getting from our internet provider are so, so SLOW that I cannot hope to make much of a difference in performance - you can't go up too far from nothing! Our upload speed is less than 0.1 Mbps! That is what I mean when I say you can't go up too far from nothing, and I don't think any amount of outside help we can get, short of an increase in performance from Time Warner, our provider will help, and they don't want to increase our speed w/o an increase in what we're currently paying - & we're currently paying almost $200/month for internet and cable - so THAT is NOT happening! As far as our download speed - on my laptop I'm currently getting 10 Mbps, and when I complained they said "well we're only paying for 15 Mbps... so it's not too bad!". It's just really aggravating - I had high hopes that we could tweak our system and get better performance, but I can't make those tweaks when our speeds from Time Warner are so poor.We've hooked those items up to the switch which were readily accessible hoping to see some increase in speed, however this was prior to doing a speed test and realizing how slow the upload and download speeds were.I do recommend TP-LINK products ... they've always served us well, and thus I do recommend this product as well. Unfortunately, until we get a new provider and/or better performance, there's just not much we can do to tweak our system. Will make an update if and when speed and performance from Time Warner Cable improves, or if we make a switch to a new provider and have significant changes in same.I did rate the switch down one star as I didn't think we should have to be wired if and when we're to see some gains in speed. Although that's not necessarily the fault of the switch, at some point all of these items will be wireless - thus my rating of 4 stars.

$REVIEW.: I absolutely think HD radio ROCKS!  There is just no comparison between digital and analog radio.  The Sony XDRF1HD is a quality piece and I would recommend it, especially for the price.  However, I must be honest, the one and only thing I do not like about this receiver is the fact that the memory goes away if power is removed, which means you will need to find all of the station presets again.  Programming the station presets is easy, but it takes 5 minutes or so and if you loose power to the system often it would be annoying.

On the Samsung PN64F8500 64-Inch 1080p 600Hz 3D Smart Plasma HDTV the glasses turn on after pressing the button (on screen box appears to let you know you are connected) and turn off automatically when 3D is no longer sensed by the glasses.  The instructions say that you need to turn them off manually but at least with my TV that is not true.  Much better.  So far the batteries seem to last quite a while.

I have the Garmin 350 and it acquires satellites faster by 1 to 2 minutes.  The other one is the proprietrary software, trainingpeaks.  I wish they'd just offer this for free.It is HUGE and I like it that way. ;)  I wear the watch to the office and people always look at it.  If you have it set to TIME only it can last 2 weeks without charging.Oh, and another gripe, for some reason the clasp/buckle of the watch rubs on my wrists, which can be inconvenient to slightly painful after awhile.I also use the heart rate monitor that came with my Garmin 305 on this watch and it works fine.

The problem is that when you place the skin on the back side of the clip, it ends up making it impossible to use with any of the Motoactv accessories since there is not enough space to clip the unit into watch, armband, clip, etc.  The screen protector seems to work fine and you can place the skin (stickers) onto the sides of the Motoactv, which I assume would offer some protection (then again, they are just stickers and I am skeptical that they will last long or offer adequate protection in the event of an accidental drop).

I've thought of setting up a WIFI system, but I've been worried I'd end up buying a lot of signal extenders to get the basement machine running online.The WD Livewire Powerline Kit pretty much solved the problem for me. It was easy to set up and the basement computer has full Internet connectivity. I had to buy a WIFI router to use this (I didn't know this when I first got it); that fact and the not-so-great documentation are the only drawbacks on my end.If you already have a WIFI network running but that network doesn't extend as far in your home or office as you'd like, consider this kit. You'll end up with the best of both worlds (WIFI for device and laptop connectivity and Livewire for far-away computers).

$REVIEW.: Wow, what can I say? Roku HD is worth the price. My wifi connection is 5mb / wired is 9mb download, so far it's sufficient and I have no trouble viewing(streaming)HD materials from Netflix. Of course HD streaming = slightly above DVD quality not an actual bluray quality.Resolution is 720p and I was very impressed by its picture quality...I was expecting pixelation or lots of buffering but so far so good. Even the standard channels are clear and are good enough to watch if you're bored of regular TV programming.Setup is quick. It took less than 10min to get me started streaming movies. Adding new channels is a breeze. I have yet to experiment with private channels. Use HDMI or Component cables for the best picture quality.I'm also amazed at how tiny the Roku box is- very easy to place anywhere you want.The only strange thing is the Roku box has no power button to turn ON or OFF - it stays ON but will automatically go to sleep mode if you are not using the unit. I guess it's okay since the tiny box probably consumes less than 5w of electricity, my 11yr old VCR probably consumes more power for just being plugged in...Thank you Amazon for free and fast shipping!

$review_text.: I was so disappointed when I got the ROKU because the set up took too long by connecting the device, updating it, going to a computer to create and account with ROKU, submit a PIN, enter a CC and then being able to actually start using the device after approximately 30 m.What is worst, Netflix is not available outside the US. I live in Costa Rica and I do have a subscription I use on many other devices so I do enjoy it all the time. I was expecting to do the same from the Roku device but I was not warned on the product features that Netflix or any other channel is for US locations only. So the product which it is available to millions of customers and many of them not US residents, it is being misrepresent it. It is sold as the perfect little thing but when you use it you get many not good at all channels you will not enjoy that much.You can watch a few channels for a bit but it is not worth it. If you have specific channels you want to enjoy and you need them, so you are expecting to get them on any device and Roku is not able to provide such experience. I waited more than 1 hr waiting to contact a Roku representative who was not able to fix this issue but just able to explain its limitations (not advertised before the purchasing) so I also spoke to a member of leadership who was not able to fix it either. I am not techy so I will not mess around with my router to change the VPN address or anything like that.My brother has an Apple TV so I just bought one in order to enjoy Netflix as expected. Amazon was great in order to compensate me for this purchase so potential buyers outside the US, think twice when buying this product if you are part of subscription channels.

That was very nice for recorded shows.  I found that  CTRL-F  and CTRL-B perform those functions.  I might I taken a half star off for that but the new version never loses connection.  A know feature in the last one was that occasionally it would stop communicating for 10-20 seconds and reconnect.  This doesn't happen any more which definitely makes up for the change in keys.

This is slightly rubberized, provides full coverage, allows you to get to all of the ports and stays put. Definitely worth the 20$! I like this better than a candy-shell style cover because the rubber wont cause rub marks to the aluminum finish.Edit: Unfortunately this product does not retain it's clear look, currently mine is a rather ugly shade of yellowed plastic color and will need replacing. It's not stained, I'm fairly careful with my iPad, but the plastic simply does not age well. I'm not sure what I expected for such a cheap price.

$review_text.: These are pretty straight forward - two flat brackets that connect to the VESA mounts of most flat screen displays. In reading some of the reviews before my purchase, I noted two items in particular.The first was that this was difficult to install with a single person. That probably depends on how one is installing the soundbar brackets. My TV is on a stand and mounting the brackets and soundbar wasn't that arduous. It can definitely be done by just one person.The second was that these were not truly universal since they don't include any hardware for keyhole mounts. That's true, but fifty cents in hardware (nuts and bolts) is all that's required to make these work.My only concern is bending over time, though that's an unfounded concern at this point. Still, I'll be keeping and eye on the brackets to make sure they're staying put and staying straight.As my TV is on a swivel stand, I really needed the soundbar to be able to move with the TV, and the Bentley Mounts achieved that. If you're thinking of buying the other similar mounts for twice the price because it includes keyhole mount hardware, just remember - fifty cents is all it takes to make the Bentleys compatible.

$review_text.: You'd think there isn't much to say about memory cards, and you'd be right. But what little there is can be extremely relevant.Obviously you want a card that is well built so that it can stand up to being taken in and out of devices, dropped in bags, etc. The Samsung passes with flying colors, feeling a bit heavier and more substantial than other cards I have. The lock switch is smooth and easy to move as well. It looks nice, too, which may not matter when it's in a camera, but it's still a nice plus, and the white and orange color scheme make it easy to find in a bag.But where the rubber hits the road is in speed: can it keep up with shooting multiple stills as well as HD video? In the case of the Samsung, I found no problems at all and it was able to keep up with whatever I was doing, whether in my Canon EOS or my Sony HX300.However, as another reviewer said, when tested, the Samsung has a great read speed, but the write speed is  lower than some competing cards which may result in a slow down when the buffer on the camera is full. However, when I used the card that didn't hobble me - perhaps if I had the fastest shooting camera on the market it would, I don't know.A fast, sturdy, good looking card with a 32 GB capacity for under 20 bucks?  For consumers and those with anything outside of the cutting edge camera equipment, I'd call that a great deal.

$REVIEW.: I'm using this for 4 satellite speakers in a 7.1 setup
I'm using the center speaker for another setup


Sound Quality is great

Particularly for small speakers


They sound very bright

Not much, if any, bass
If you want bass, you need to get a subwoofer.I have the 4 speakers wall mounted
The way they attach to the wall is fine
There are two screws (not supplied) per speaker that the bracket slides over

I'm able to get them to hug the wall pretty easily
The problem is adjusting the position of the speaker
There are 3 allen wrench screws per speaker that need to be tightened once the speaker is in the right spot


The allen wrench is provided
The problem is the allen wrench doesn't fit in the screws easily and they have to be very tight or else the speakers will flop.The instructions that came with the speakers that pertain to this don't match the speakers
The instructions list 2 screws at the base of the bracket that need to be tightened
In reality, there are 3 screws on the speakers themseleves
Other models have the 2 screws

My guess is Klipsch tried to save money by having one user manual for many speakers.Bottom line is if you want them to rest on a flat surface, no problem
if you plan on wall mounting and want them in a position other than flopped straight down at a 45 degree angle, be prepared for some skinned knuckles and some frustration.

$review_text.: As a longtime Nikon and Minolta (in the film days, I'm 56)shooter, I needed a smaller carry-around camera to use on a daily basis.  I purchased a Fuji X100 last year, and intrigued by the fantastic picture quality of the X100, I started to look at the XE-1.  Almost hit the button on the XE-1, but I really didn't need another camera, and the price at the time was high. I came across a steal for a Nikon V1 with the 10-30 for $250 refurbed. I liked the camera, fast auto focus etc., but the pics didn't hold a candle to the Fuji X100. Last week Fuji announced the XE-2, I immediately saw the price drop on used ones.  Picked up an XE-1 with the 18-55 zoom, and have been blown away by the pics.  A head to head comparison at full resolution with my D600 and 16-35 this week showed the pictures shot with the XE-1 to be sharper and slightly more detailed.  Granted it was only an afternoon of fall foliage shooting, but in several different locations, it showed the Fuji files (jpeg)better.  Is the Nikon D600 more versatile, faster focusing, and more advanced? Sure is, but for the $800 I paid for the XE-1, it's a keeper.

$REVIEW.: I have well over 1000 CDs


 For a long time, I considered the bookshelves and bookshelves of space that the collection required a tribute to my musical taste and experiences over the years
 Indeed, the jewel cases just seemed to be an easy way to observe the entire collection and rapidly select the CD that I felt like listening to at the moment.Recently, a friend was over at my apartment and commented that the collection just looked ridiculously unwieldy
 She had made the converstion to the CD wallet years ago and was never going back to the space cluster that jewel cases required.On her recommendation, I ordered the Case Logic 264 CD Wallet (she said that anything larger would be a bit heavy to move around with ease despite the fact that I had so many CDs)


 Of course, I should say that I ordered 7 of the cases so as to accomdate the large selection.The only comment that appropriately conveys my sentiment is: WOW!  This is great

 Here's why:1
Shelves and shelves of CD shelving have been cleared/removed and converted into 7 (actually about 6.5) CD wallets
 It's unbelievable how great this feels in a New York City apartment
 It has opened up a bunch of space.2


The Case Logic wallet is extremely well constructed
 Having used a smaller version for the car, I somewhat know what to expect
 THe backing of each insert is soft to ensure that CDs aren't scratched and the plastic that holds the CD in place is nice and secure

 Though some have complained about the plastic binder not being able to open midway/midbook in order to easily reorder pages, it seems a LOT more secure than metal ring binders would be in the long term.3
I opted for the 2 CDs per side rather than the 4 that is potential

 Instead, I put the album liner notes next to each CD

 Though this essentially cuts down by 1/2 the number of CDs each book can hold, it seems more pleasing to the eye and disks are much more easily accessible than having to root around behind liner notes to retrieve disk

 Moreover, the fit seemed much too tight with 4 disks and liner notes per side

 Last, trying to get the CDs out of the sleeves when stored 4 to a side with liner notes was a bit hard and I worried about scratching the CD (some of which are long out of print and prized).4


The koskin case is very nice
 Even though I store the wallets in a cabinet now, I imagine you could leave these on a bookshelf and they would not look like too much of an eyesore.5
Access to the CDs is very easy
 Because the sleeves can be reordered, I stuck with an alphabetic listing for rapid access....sometimes one just has to hear THAT song, right?Basically, this product is a delight

 I know it sounds crazy and a bit overdone, but I legimately freed up tons of space and my concerns over the practicality of these CD wallets has been allayed


 Funny, I actually will need to get an 8th in just a little while.....but it's easier than building another bookshelf.Final rating?  A FIVE (5).

$REVIEW.: When my wife and I went on our honeymoon, I noticed that she used the video recording feature of her then Canon A80 quite frequently. But the video was low resolution and only a choppy 15 frames per second.We had the opportunity to go to China recently, so we decided on this camera for our trip. The video quality is excellent and helped capture some of our experiences you can only recreate with video.Being small, we took it with us everywhere. I have never used an image-stabilized lens before, but now I'm a believer. This is a great family camera--something small that you'll want to take around. It'll get great snapshots and capture video that looks good enough for DVD.Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: This review is not about the item but should be noted that you will most likely never get your rebate

 More than once I buy these cards, submit the rebates and it is denied
 Always on their side not mine

 One time they said a paper was missing yet it was scanned and shown online


 Another they said the purchased date was not shown but in reality it was but their mail scanners are so poor you could not read it clearly


 You then have to re-submit everything through the mail and weeks later they will say something else is missing
 So good luck with a rebate, it is not worth the time and aggravation.

$review_text.: Great little camera. Actually bought it after I got tickets to the Lady Gaga concert in Atlanta, due to the high ratings for night shots at concerts. A real bummer that Lady Gaga hurt her back and the concert in March 2013 was canceled. So didn't get to try it out for what I specifically bought it for, however have been using it to take photos on my motorcycle rides in North Georgia and various hikes in the mountains. It takes perfectly clear pictures, many settings, good autofocus and has a nice zoom. Well worth the money.

$REVIEW.: For years I bought these routers along with the N900, but no more. I have installed 19 routers for my customers in 2013, and at the time of this review, all but 2 or 3 of them are still working. The wireless radios go in them, or they just go all together and you get 2 yellow lights on the front. These routers are good because they have nice radio range, but it does not good if they cannot last a full year.Don't waste your money, I now use CISCO for routers and ASUS for access points, have not had a single one fail yet.

$REVIEW.: If you care about keeping your PC cool, you won't go buy fans for $5-$7 that barely push any air. You'll buy these.The fan blades don't 'quiver' as they spin like the cheap alternatives do, and they push a far greater amount of air than the cheaper no-name brand Asian market fans. They don't 'whir' or 'grind' on startup, they consistently emit the same amount of noise (which is purely the sound of air going through them; louder than that emitted by most case fans). The fans have built in rubber stoppers where the screws go in to hold the fans tight to the case without any future rattling or loosening.These fans aren't showy. There's no cool chrome or light up LED's. They are matte black and come with several optional rings of various colors (red, white, blue) that can be installed on the fan, but don't have to go on there.The cords aren't super long, maybe 12". Remember that these are performance fans, they're not ultra quiet- but they don't emit unnecessary noise like whirring, grinding, or rattling.After installing these as a replacement for my entire case, I watched my graphics card's resting temperature go down about 2 degrees. Not a coincidence, I think.

$review_text.: My interest in Home Media originates from a musical background as a musician and avid listener.The RX-A3000 is my 6th Yamaha DSP A/V receiver since my first (DSP-E300) in 1990--having owned other A/V amps including the first ever Dolby Digital (AC3) compatible (Pioneer). Yamaha's major feature to me is the natural sound on all their DSP SoundFields. Most every other receiver listened to does Dolby and DTS movie surround sound decoding just fine, but if you are into listening to 2 channel music processed to sound like different venues such as The Roxy, The Bottom Line, various concert halls in Europe etc. nobody does it better than Yamaha.  Other receivers have rather phony sounding processing using their proprietary chips.I think the key to the Yamaha is the original research and recording done back when they designed their first DSP unit the DSP-1 in 1986 or so. As a matter of fact, I liked the processing on my Yamaha DSP E-300 so much that I daisy chained it to later more state of the art A/V amps so that I could use it for music listening. Now with the RX-A3000 it has just about the same amount of concert venues as the E-300, plus a bunch of DSP Cinema Modes as well.Yamaha makes the optimization of your listening environment quite easy with their YPAO setup.  It goes through a checklist of speaker connections and phase of each speaker. Then it sends out tones which are captured by a microphone to analyze the room acoustics and sets a variety of parameters, such as the speaker size, the distance of the speakers and even the sound pressure level.  It also allows for what I'd call a "blended" setup whereby measurements can be taken and stored from more than one listening position so that the end result is not tailored to just one sweet spot in the room.The unit can be expanded to 11.2 channels with external amps, but an out of the box 7.2 setup is more than adequate for me (the RX-A3000 has outputs for 2 subwoofers which can be configured for Front/Rear, Front Mono, or Front Stereo).Since this is a Video as well as Audio device, it must be noted that there are no fewer than 8 (7 + 1 in front) HDMI 3D compatible inputs and 2 HDMI outs. A new OSD GUI can now overlay on HD sources, and after a little bit of practice becomes very intuitive and useful.The RX-V3000 has a new HQV Vida high-class video chipset, which has a myriad of adjustments if you want to tweak the picture (potentially more useful for SD DVD and analog video) or just let the signal pass through.  I let the Yamaha upscale to 1080p, TiVo OTA/Netflix, SD DVDs, AppleTV, as well as OTA TV with stunning results.  The receiver is the first piece of equipment in my eventual upgrade to full 3D, but in the interim, 2D Blu-ray, and HD DVD are an awesome experience due to its sound and state of the art circuitry.Indeed, the physical chassis has been beefed up in this series featuring a 5th foot for stability and vibration control, and H-shaped cross member frame with double bottom construction. With all its improvements Yamaha has seen fit to extend the OEM warranty from 2 to 3 years.The Yamaha iPod dock I've been using since the days of the RX-V2700 is compatible and the OSD has been improved greatly making it more of a pleasure to use compared to the old interface.  The main improvement for me is the ability to scroll 10 pages at a time to find music, but it's too bad there's still no alpha/numeric search because I have over 13,000 songs.The unit can be controlled with an iPhone app, in addition to a regular web browser when the Yamaha is part of your LAN.  And speaking of control, the remote is not exactly the best around with some of the more used buttons (for me) being buried under a hinged door.  But if you happen to prefer a universal remote (my choice is the Logitech Harmony One), that's all moot. Yamaha is very good at disseminating their remote codes both the default and extended which have a lot of discrete ones not on the OEM remote (e.g. accessing a particular Classical Hall directly instead of toggling though the choices etc.).So if you're looking for an extremely versatile piece of equipment to be the heart and soul of your video experience, which can also bring immense musical enjoyment, I can't recommend this unit more highly.

$REVIEW.: I'm a happy owner of this TV for about a week now, I really love everything about it.Set up:- Took me about 15M to set up the TV, no joke lol. All you need is a regular small screwdriver and your good to go. About 4 screws and your good to go.  2 of the screws need to go in a holl. ALl you have to do is let the magnet on the tip of the screwdriver to handle this.  Its very easy, about 15M your good to go. The TV is very light, well thats if you work out lol. I took the TV to my room with one hand.Picture:. 1080P, 120HZ, connected with a HDMI to my Xbox 360 Slim is as good as it gets. My first impression of the picture was priceless. I realized that first impression means everything, if you like the TV rite away, you will love it. Very Bright colors but not to bright, just about right. Colors look very beautiful and its really easy to see every single detail. Playing NBA 2k on this TV seems like a real basketball game. MY mom walked in my room and thought NBA was back, thats how real the picture is. Love watching Netflix on it, I started playing Halo again for the first time in about 3 months.  There are 5 different picture mode, Game, Custom, Vivid, Standard, and Cinema. I keep my TV on game mode. Picture looks better even on Movies.Sounds: I am very impressed with the sound of this TV. I used to have separate attached speakers to my old tv, but this Panasonic comes with really good sound. For gamers out there, I strongly recommend putting the Bass of the sound to 7. The default bass is set to 0. Just go to Audio and you will see options that will help you put the Bass up. The reason i put the Bass up is because when playing action games or watching action movies, It makes the gun shots sound much better and deeper. When i throw a grenade on Halo, It blows up like BAMMM!!! Everything else is already set up good for you. Just put the Bass UP.LCD vs Plasma. I have a 50' Plasma in the living-room, Been a owner of 20" LCD in my room. I decided to upgrade from the 20" LCD to 42". When playing Video Games on the 50" Plasma, I think its to dark. Plasma TV's make the black level really realistic, which could be good for some people, but I was never happy playing video games on the Plasma. Even though I had a 50" Plasma, I still played most of my video games on the 22" LCD.  I find it much more comfortable playing video games and even watching movies on the LCD. The dark level is not to dark, and not to light, just about right. My first impression of the plasma TV was that it was too dark, even when putting the brightness up and the contrast up, and any other lightening setting up, Plasma TV's seem to dark for my Taste. That's why I picked LCD over Plasma for my room.Size: 42" is just the perfect size for me. I sit about 6 feet away from the TV. Its not to big for video games, and not to small eater, once again just about right. I mention a lot about video games because I am a big time Gamer. Was on a 80G winning streak on NBA 2k11 (ranked), as you can see I don't play around lol. Anyways about the size. I was scared to upgrade from 20", because I thought 42" might be to big for video games, I was wrong, I'm still balling people up big time on 2k. I also watch a lot of Netflix during the night, and once again, Size is just perfect. I have the tv in my room, rite in-front of my Bed.HDMI. This TV has 3 HDMI spots. I got my Xbox Connected and my laptop so far. My desktop is 42", how coo is that? lol. For Netflix lovers, you don't need to get Roku player to connect Neflix to your TV. connected computer to the TV with the HDMI cable will save you about $80, and it works perfect. I also purchased HDMI from Amazon for about $2, and just love it. When connecting your computer to the TV make shore to change the screen format to Zoom. The format button is next to mute. This will fit the screen perfect for computer use.  When I first plugged in my laptop, the screen was to small, just zoom in with the format, its made just for this. Also when I first connected my laptop to the TV, there was no sound, all you have to do is rite click on the sound bar on the bottom corner of your computer. Once you rite click on the volume bar, click playback devices. Then set your sound to the High Deff default. Once you see it its really easy to see what I'm saying. If you still have problems with your sound, just Google it, LOL that's what I did.Value & Cost. I purchased this TV for $594 with a 24 month financing with no interests . Basically I have 2 years to pay off the TV, with no interests.  I used my Amazon store card to get this plan.  This TV is really worth every dime if you can afford it. Its worth the money, specially if your a big time gamer. Trust me, you will be satisfied. I thought about the value many times and did a lot of research, and found this TV to be the most reasonable.Overall I really love this TV and I would definitely recommend, specially for my gamers out there.Note: I"m to lazy to proofread this review, will fix my bad grammar and spelling later on. Just wanted to let my opinion out for you Byers out there.  I apologize for my bad writing skills, I'm a foreign speaker :). Feel free to ask me any other questions I didn't cover, I will love to Ans it Asap.Thank You - DavidDavid

I had several AMD CPU:1.AMD Athlon XP 1900+ 1.6 GHZ2.AMD Athlon XP-M 2800+ 1.6 GHZ(for laptop)3.AMD Athlon 64 3000+ 1.8GHZ4.AMD Athlon 64 X2 5000+ 2.6 GHZ5.AMD sempron 140 2.7 GHZ6.AMD A8-3500M 2.4GHz (FOR LAPTOP)7.AMD FX-8120 3.1 GHZThat's all CPU from AMD i had owned right now.let's talk about AMD FX-8120 3.1 GHZ.price cheaper than any other processor in the same level only $175, $44 Less than Intel Core i5-2500K and $30 less than AMD FX-8150.OVERCLOCK & Temperature:temperature with normal use about 39C-42C.But int heavy load it goes to 50C-55C. but the big problem with fan sound with heavy load it's look like car engine you can't imagine who that was horrible(fan speed:6900 RPM)(that's was best way to keep processor with 57C with out change/add any value to CPU).This process Can be overclocked to 4.8 GHZ easily with out any issue (you need to edit voltage)and the temperature never goes over 57C when overclocked to 4.3 GHZ with all cores.every thing work perfectly unless one thing it's the speed between CPU and RAM(it's necessary to have high speed?). if you have SSD(solid state drive) with read speed 555 MB/s(Corsair Force Series GT 120 GB) your system will give you reading speed only 430~450 MB/s only if you have CPU,RAM bandwidth up to 10000 ~ 13000 MB/s. But with Intel Core (i5-2500K/i7-2600K) you will get full speed approximately.that's all right now.

$REVIEW.: I use this light in my home office and have it clipped to the side of my desk. I actually leave it on all the time, as a nightlight at night and to supplement the floor lamp next to it during the day when I'm working. It sort of reminds me of Pacman when open, actually.For me the light isn't bright enough to rely on alone, but when used alongside the floor lamp it fills in the dark spots very nicely.The sound quality of the speaker is good - when I'm working a do not like loud music, so I keep my iPhone at low volumes anyhow when working. It's not adequate for a party, but serves the purpose I use it for well.Since the light is LED, it remains cool to the touch even when on for several hours. And LEDs use little power, another plus.I did try to use it as a reading light in bed - clipped it onto the bedside table and it works well for that - plenty of light and didn't disturb my wife when she was sleeping. But in the office is where I use this little light every day.The lamp is well made. I have 4 AA batteries installed in case of a power outage but leave it plugged in. A 3.5mm Jack cord is also included that plugs into the headphones port of my iPhone when I want to listen to music. The lamp will not charge your iPhone, though - which would be a huge plus. But all in all, this is a nice little lamp.

$review_text.: I liked the way these feel in my ears- I always found earbuds painful but these are a great shape and material.  Sound quality was decent but not amazing. They come with a nice case, too, for storing them and not getting them tangled. The fact that it turns at the end is awesome because they really do go into your ear in a natural way.The thing is, though, that a lot of other companies have realized this, as well, so these really are not the only comfortable option out there. It's nice that it came with size options BUT the tips fall off too easily. I lost the ones that fit me well and had to use the bigger ones. I actually bought replacement tips from their website.. then within a month, the chord tore at the bottom and the sound is all messed up now! I threw them out today becuase there is no way to fix that.These did last me a little over a year, which is decent for $30 headphones, but there are $7 headphones out there that can do the same thing. I won't be bothering to buy a new pair of these - I ordered some cheaper ones. As long as the cheaper ones last even 6 months, they'll be a better overall value. I could buy two pairs of cheap headphones and still be spending about half of what I spend on these.. Oh, and the case that it came with is cool but it is ripping now. Again, it lasted a year so it's not HORRIBLE but it's just not really worth it, either. Buy different headphones and a separate case and it's still cheaper than these! There are higher reated, cheaper earbuds out there that will make you happier.

$REVIEW.: I was considering several different DVI cameras before purchasing this product.When I saw good reviews about onlineenterprises888, I send him e-mail inquiring which DVR he would recommend
 He responded quickly with information and I selected this DVI.The camera produces great quality videos with sound, runs on a continues loop which will record over 24hrs


I am over all happy with this product


 However, the display had white stripes after a week
 I contacted the seller onlineenterprises888, he replaced immediately

 After few months, the display developed a problem again

 Onlineenterprises888 helped me again to replace the DVR

 I am very grateful


 Thanks, Nick

 I thinks the device is very sensitive with movement or shocks


So handle it with care.

$review_text.: These are really nice, light weight, great fit, perfectly wonderful sound too plus a good price!This pair of headphones are replacing an older set of Sony headphones that sounded alright - til I heard these! The Sonys let too much &#34;outside sound&#34; in, background noises, pet sounds, all the junk that keeps you from really enjoying your music. These Audio Technica headphones keep most of that out, except for very loud sounds - which you may need to hear in case something is wrong! Good music reproduction, good extraneous noise blocking, good fit, plenty of cord, very sturdy all-metal stereo plug AND an extra male adapter for the old style 1/4&#34; stereo plugs......What a deal!

$review_text.: Our household has PCs and a Mac (I have the PCs, wife has the Mac), and these work pretty seamlessly with WD device. The Mac was &#34;download the software and go.&#34; My Windows 7 computer took an hour of phone support to see the cloud drive on the network. But that's Microsoft's fault because of their always crappy, idiosyncratic OS's. The WD phone support was excellent, and was right on the mark for the many deeply buried Windows network modes that must be set just so,An extra bonus is the USB expansion port. I already had a terabyte external drive loaded with favorite movies. I plugged it in, and my 4 TB of cloud storage became 5. Plus my movies were all set to stream to computers and phones in the house.

$review_text.: Thus far, I can tell you I love the device. I have a kindle paperwhite that I use for reading, and I've long since staved off the purchase of another device. I say another, because in out house we have a Mac Pro, Macbook Pro, Ipad, 2 macbook's and one netbook. (we've since given away 3 of the laptops) So, buying another device that will sit wasn't on my agenda. As a writer, I didn't want something that played fart noises and has a dj turn table, and as a consumer I didn't want something that I could continue to use and upgrade as time goes on.The ipad we have is great, it's a fun toy, we watch movies on it and gal pal uses Medical app's to help with medical school and what not. The app store is vast and that's great but 98% of them are things you'll never use, try or care for. So the lack of app's on Surface was never as daunting as people made it out to be. So here is why I got the surface.Again, writer, wrote a book, will probably write more, actor, often find myself walking around and showing people a reel of myself and trying not to feel silly while doing so. This device comes with Microsoft Word, which sure will be better once I get the keyboard but what people are forgetting, any keyboard will work. Any. You can get the touch or type cover, or you can plug on in through it's provided USB output, or get another bluetooth and then, Shazaam! Keyboard. Speaking of which, it has a USB output. I can transfer stuff on a USB drive, I can plug in an external drive and play all sorts of stuff. Keyboards, all that jazz. I haven't tried it yet, but I am assuming I can plug my camera into it and presto, files transferred, have yet to try that but a USB works just as a USB works. So, there's that wonderful feature. It also works as a monitor thing. I can plug the micro usb into the side and then plug that into my TV. I can then mirror what's on the screen, it can make it so it's half and half and all that. Apparently people who have xbox one and or xbox 360 claim they can't live without it. So, I don't know if they are using this as a monitor of what, but I suppose one could look that up.Not enough space on the 32 gig version, get a 64gig microSD and then BLAMO! 64 gig's. Sitting. Waiting. READY!The 32 gig ipad is now getting the shuffle that comes with limited storage. Throw one to many songs, books, pictures on there and now Grandma who died a few years ago's picture is getting deleted because it was either keep that file or get a new app with a bird jumping around squaking that you'll play for a hot 2 minutes. But with this expandable format, one can infinitely go nuts. If you want to use one card, or many you could. A card for music, movies, pictures and all that. All on one, of 64 gig's of each on different ones'. Given the size of the card, you can easily carry a bunch with you in a tiny case. And you'd feel good about yourself, all the world's knowledge could be at your finger tips. Without having to delete dead Grandma.Now, productivity, yes there is a learning curve. You don't just tap something and go about your day. You can, but once you learn how to use this device it's stunning. Just earlier I had a youtube video explaining something about history (go vlogbrothers) while I searched through photo's on the other half the screen. I was looking over bank information so I can go buy more stuff, while I was watching a show on netflix. I was trying to sync outlook while on the other half of the screen copying and pasting information I would soon need. So, once you get that all down which takes a minute or two of swiping, you are all set.App's load in a few seconds, any of them.Speaking of App's. It has what you need, it has games, (played Halo Assault, good game) (and if I wanted to plug in a controller, I could) it has a bunch of Microsoft app's for free, which if you've ever had Office is unheard of.OneNote.Word.Excel.Outlook.Free.So, take that you silly bird flinging fools. But if games are your thing, there are some. One's that will take a week to beat instead of a minute. Car games, shooting games, and build up a hero games. Some are free, some cost money and all seem to be good.Surface app store is alot like Nintendo versus IOS App store which is like the Atari. If you didn't know, Atari made anything. ANYTHING and it ruined home games. Games glitched, games froze people didn't move and ET never made it home. Then nintendo came along, threw a seal of approval on each game promising it worked. And then presto, people bought games again. Not saying every game is perfect, but the fact that it isn't so saturated you will end up downloading and deleting is a nice thing.Hardware itself.It's long, light, seemingly strong enough for me to hit someone with it and laugh hysterically while I shove handfuls of gummy bears down my yap with my free hand. So, there's that. It's a nice metal body, stretch screen that is nice for reading and playing with stuff. My screen always looks a little less &#34;pop&#34; as I don't have it turned up all the way. It I do turn it up, presto looks crisp.Kickstand is nice, didn't think it'd use it until all a sudden I noticed I was using it every time the device was on.Battery last all day, general task and you are good for a long time. I charge mine every two days, use it for internet, youtube, playing around with it and hitting people while eating gummies.So again,Excellent hardware, Excellent software, App's store is growing. Can be used as a drive, doesn't play super nice with google calendar at the moment, but sync's email just fine and dandy.Learning curve is a day or so, but once you get it working it's so easy to do everything. This is as close to a laptop as you can get without going all out laptop.I love apple, I have a super expensive Mac Pro and another super expensive Macbook Pro within feet of me right now, and I went with the surface. In the end, most other tablet's are like playing checkers. It's fun, because right away you get it and you know how to move the pieces around. Eventually, you'll end up playing the same game over and over waiting for a new shiny set to keep you from realizing, it's the same game.The surface is like chess. At first, you have no idea what the horse does and why the triangle one flies diagnolly across the board. And when someone does a &#34;castling&#34; you lose it. But then you learn what the knight and bishop do (and what their names are) and the game is expandable, it's ever changing and it's functional. Once you start multitasking and being productive, you see that the stuff you wanted has always been a toy that was only meant to distract, and you can start working on your new book.

$REVIEW.: I have just returned the second MBP for defects. First one had couple of keys on keyboard with some scratches and super drive was some what loud. the  second one had some issue with mouse cursor freezing up. especially when I'm using photoshop to zoom in and out (or other quick key function), it would freeze and lose control over what I wanted to do.I should have kept the first one if I had know that second one would have more serious issue. anyways, what I have learned is that Apple do not have the best QA and bit disappointed. I'm now without a laptop until Amazon send me a replacement. Hopefully next one will be a decent one.

The usb thing that plugs into your computer is tiny, so I just leave mine in my computer, but if you don't want to, it stores inside the battery compartment.One day mine stopped working, and I was going to buy a new one, but I discovered that gently swirling a Q tip inside the optical hole helped greatly, and I've had no problems since.

$review_text.: I jumped at the chance to get a review copy of this camera because of its remarkable lens range for a compact camera.  Had I paid for this, it would be on its way back for a refund though as the image quality is just plain bad at full resolution.Background: I'm a "prosumer" photographer and have a Canon Rebel SLR with various lenses for high quality shots, and a Canon PowerShot SD750 that is in my pocket for hiking, skiing and travel.  The PowerShot turns on instantly, take beautiful 7 megapixel images instantly, and lasts several days and hundreds of shots on a single charge.  But, with only a 3X optical zoom, it cannot reach very far, nor is its widest angle wide enough for home interior shots.This Fuji F300EXR's lens range is its greatest asset.  The wide angle position will satisfy realtors and home seekers and the zoom can satisfy nature and sports enthusiasts.  But, don't expect images that are as clean and full of detail as the much cheaper Canon PowerShot in spite of the 12 megapixel size of the Fuji images.  And, don't expect fast performance.  It takes about 5 seconds after you turn on the F300EXR before it is ready to take a picture, and you will at times be waiting for it to store the previous shot.I took the Fuji on a 10 day trip with my wife to the World Equestrian Games in Lexington, Kentucky and took still shots, panoramas and videos there with it, along with shots there and at home to do side by side comparisons with the cheaper, less capable Canon PowerShot.  In all cases, the Canon won - except for the ability of the Fuji to zoom in on the action.Images taken with this Fuji look very "processed".  Even on the "Fine" setting, images show strong JPEG compression artifacts when viewed at 100% in Photoshop, grass and pine needles blur, and some edges look like they've had a sharpening filter applied to them with settings that are too extreme resulting in strange contrast artifacts.  Even in full daylight photos, some regions have random dark noise in them.Note:  If you look at the images on a monitor at anything less than 100% ("actual size"), you may not see these issues.  In particular, when viewed at 25% or even 50%, the images look fine.  I'm sure that 4x6 prints would look fine too.  But, some of the reasons for having as many as 12 megapixels are to allow for either large prints, the ability to get a printable image from a cropped portion of the full image,  or  the ability to get full-pixel, cropped detail for the web.  If none of these is needed, then you don't need a high megapixel camera.The same images with the little PowerShot look great.  Why?  Opening and comparing images in Photoshop, each camera compresses the image down to about 12% of its full size when the least JPEG compression is selected.  (For one scene, the Canon compressed to 13.3% of original and this Fuji to 12.5% of original.)  So, compression in itself is not the problem.  I can only guess that it is a combination of whatever post-processing the Fuji does prior to storage along with the unique-to-Fuji "EXR" CCD sensor which lays out the red, blue and green pixels in a different arrangement than any other CCD.  See dpreview.com for technical details on this.I had high hopes for the HD video that this Fuji can record.  However, it too is burdened with noise and blurred/processed details.  That would be OK if it was only going to be compressed and uploaded to YouTube, but the camera is incapable of maintaining focus if you zoom while recording!  As I took video of horses riding in the World Equestrian Games, the camera stayed reasonably focused as I panned around the arena.  But, any time I zoomed, the camera immediately went out of focus and did not regain focus until several seconds after I stopped zooming (whether in or out).  In contrast, my little Canon PowerShot stays crisp at all times... but with its 3x optical zoom, I would not have been able to get close to the horse as I did with the Fuji.When zoomed fully, in full daylight, the image taken with the Fuji is distinctly fuzzy if viewed at 100% pixel view.  I probably should not expect more from a compact lens that can zoom to a 300mm equivalent, so just mention it. When viewed at 50% (basically reducing the 12 megapixel image to 3 megapixels), the image looks fine.The mode selection dial on the camera is a pain.  It is mounted at a 45 degree angle to the camera body, and it seemed that every time I pulled the camera out of its case, or my backpack or coat pocket, the camera was set in a different mode than where I had left it, wasting some initial shots.  I've never had a camera with this issue before.The battery life is pretty bad.  I barely got a few hours of shooting in with the Fuji the first day before the battery died.  I can shoot for days with the Canon PowerShot.  The SD card is accessed via the same door as the battery, on the bottom of the camera.  Like most compact cameras, this means you cannot access the card or battery while the camera is mounted to a tripod.The Fuji did come with a 4 GB class 6 memory card, which was nice.  The card does not eject very far as with most SD card sockets.  When you press it in, it pops out less than a quarter of an inch, and very close to the hinged door.  You need good fingernails to get the card out from there.  The camera came with a USB cable and a standard RCA video/mono sound cable.  You would need your own mini HDMI cable if you wanted to watch the video shot on the camera on your HD TV.Since all photos are JPEG (there is no option for any other format) and videos are standard AVI files, just like the Canon PowerShot, the images and videos could be viewed immediately on any computer or iPad without any additional software.The camera has lots of custom shooting modes and features that are potentially pretty cool.  But, since the basic imagery is of marginal quality, I won't make this review longer by discussing those features.To sum up:  you can find much better image quality and battery life elsewhere.  You might consider this camera if you really need the 15x optical zoom and wide angle features and you will always be making 8x10 or smaller prints or web images without major cropping.
$review_summary.: 15x zoom and wide angle are the main competitive strengths

The view finder is a full 3 inches which is a GREAT feature. The price could not be beat either and the color is, well, COOL! Picture quality is fine but I am still learning how to take pictures in differnt lighting. I hate to read manuals so I am learning as I go. Oh, and you do have to hold down the button 1/2way until it focuses then depress it all the way for a clear picture.

$REVIEW.: Cannon products can be found throughout my home, and have been used by me for many years


Always reliable, and performed without fail
I suspect that this new addition to my family will be no exception

Mainly used as a back up printer, the colors are not quite 100 true, but pretty close


Compared to my current model the 5320, this one is not quite as versatile, but for my needs, it's not an issue

Easy to set up using windows 7, yet boot up times as mentioned by other reviewers is about a minute or two.


But then So is my current model


I appreciate that cannon has stayed true to the individual tanks layout, but wish they would allow for continuous printing in black if one of the color tanks runs out

It does have wifi and AirPrint , a great feature if you have an iPad or iPhone


Cannon support has always been most helpful to me, in the two instances I had some questions.

They feel and look like they are constructed with proper materials, and they even come with plastic covers over each connector to protect it from damage and dust.Of course, in terms of cables of this length, any HDMI cable will provide exactly the same image quality to your display due to the fact that it is a digital signal. Yes, there are 6ft HDMI cables out there that are selling for over $100 (I've even seen over $1000, incredibly).. well that's simply a case of greedy idiots pandering to ignorant idiots.In short: get these, they are cheap and good.

$REVIEW.: After a long and arduous search, this remote arrived.  My wife has always hated our home theater.  Too many remotes.  I have hated to explain how to use it when my mother-in-law keeps the kids.  There was an instruction manual I typed to save myself from endless questions.Enter this remote.  No touch screens to fail.  Online programming.  Syncs with my iPad/iPhone.  And, drumroll please... IT WORKS.My wife can push one button and watch TV.  My Roku, Yamaha receiver, LG Blu-ray all work together.  Cisco COX receiver is happy.  I'm happy.  Even my 4 year old has learned how to turn on the TV...

$REVIEW.: Yes, the overall sound is limited, but for the very low price this system is a real bargain. And if it's close to your ears - such as at your computer table - you will be pretty happy with what you hear.Easy to set up, and very well thought out controls. The combo on-off, tone, volume, illuminated rotary control is brilliant, why can't systems costing lots more have this kind of intuitive, simple control knob?

Within two weeks a wire in the cord broke causing one channel to drop out.

$REVIEW.: I really like this keyboard because it does feel solid and has good weight, and the keys are firmly in place.  It feels very well made.  The strength of the signal can be a problem if your computer is obstructed or far away.  Thankfully there are 2 USB 1.1 slots on my regular keyboard on my desk and I just keep the receiver permanently plugged into it, and signal quality is great!.  Using it is difficult because I'm new to small devices,  I'm getting used to the trackpad and how easy it is to register as a left click.  I find that if I take my time when navigating with it, that I do better and I have less accidental clicks.  I experienced one of the keys sticking and I've read other reviews about that.  Hopefully it's just a breaking in thing and will work itself out.  I thought that the only left and right mouse button were on the right hand side, and using it that way felt awkward and cumbersome, but today I found out that the Fn key on the left side acts as a left mouse button and that makes all the difference in the world.  It feels a little awkward when using the multimedia keys because you have to hold the Fn key along with one of the F keys to turn up volume, etc. I'm sure it will become easier and I don't use the multimedia keys that much.  And speaking of Media, this works great in XBMC without any additional configuration and that was the main reason for getting this.  Now I would like to find a website dedicated to this that discusses hidden tricks and hidden features or tweaks to use.  Overall I'm happy with it and I took a star because of the stuck key issue. I also wanted to add that I didn't mean "Toy" as in Childs toy...I just meant as a fun (functional) device.

$review_text.: I used this mount for an LG 47" TV. Wall mounting hardware is solid and I have no complains there. TV brackets are solid, again no complaints.Everyone that complained about the hex key not being long enough is not using it correctly. The short end goes into the screw. I think most people are trying to tighten it from the sides, which is what I was trying to do at first before I realized that it was nearly impossible. Make sure to hand tighten it first though, after your tv is mounted then you can make adjustments. Another plus is Sanus has plenty of resources from illustrations to installation videos to make everything very easy complete.:My complaints:Since the mount is meant to be very slim. it it is impossible to plug the tv in unless you have a recessed outlet, which is what I ended up installing. The finger tip tilt action isn't possible. I had to tighten my screws up a lot to stop the TV from leaning forward. Finally one of the bottom locking mechanisms is flimsy and will unlock itself when trying to tilt up.All in all, I have 100% peace of mind that my TV won't fall off the wall, but I would like to see the tilt feature act as described.

$REVIEW.: Gets the job done. Expensive, though, for what it does. It does seem to handle all the commands, but you'll need to memorize them and use them frequently so as not to forget. The hardest part seems to be playing back Blu-ray Discs. There are all these controls that are hard enough to remember on the usual controller (one of my least favorite things about watching movies on the PS3 instead of a dedicated machine (but I really don't need a BD player that duplicates features I have already)), but then you have to figure out how to access those controls on the Harmony remote. Rather than on-screen buttons for all commands (just some), the physical buttons on the remote are also used.I'm sure over time that I'll find this easier to work with (it's not *hard*, per se, but not immediately intuitive, that's for sure), but for the money, the part seems cheap, the interface does not make life any easier, and I have to use another outlet up to have this thing working, all so I can use the Harmony as a remote instead of walking over to a controller, picking it up off the charger and using it instead. I think the dream price on this is closer to $30, honestly.

I also noticed that my Mac at baseline with almost nothing running was using 4.2gb of RAM which explains why it was so pathetically slow when I only had 4gb of Ram in it.  It came with Snow Leapord but I've upgraded it all the way up to Mavericks.  I should also mention I have also loaded Yosemite developer version on it to test some apps and it too runs fantastic with this memory in it.  Total of 8gb.  If you plan on going Mavericks or Yosemite on your Macbook... do yourself a huge favor and upgrade your RAM to minimum of 8GB.  You wont be sorry.

$REVIEW.: My desktop systems, probably from the budget optical drives I throw in them, have an uncanny habit of failing at the wrong times while externals and laptop drives tend to last me forever, them usually being handed off to friends that need them worse than me before expiring

I found myself needing one when I needed to reinstall windows on my system and it just would not read any bootable or rewritable disk formats, of which the windows disks are bootable

I got this one because it was a good price and though the style is more artsy than practical and it isn't the fastest one I've ever had it's built a little more solid than others I've owned in the lower price ranges and it did exactly what it was supposed to, which was act as external Optical drive for bootable and rewritable formated disks that the internal drive refuses to read anymore.

$review_text.: I was initially hesitant to purchase one of these since it seemed like a pointless device for me

I have a Netflix subscription and use Youtube quite frequently, but when I'm away, I can always pull that up on my phone to watch or plug in my laptop with an HDMI cable
For home use, I already have an Apple TV and the next gen consoles that could stream anything I desire

I had no need for a Chromecast.Well, I was recently in a situation where I wanted to pull up a Netflix show for a friend,  but did not have my laptop and could not feasibly watch it on my phone with another person

Suddenly, I saw the value of the Chromecast
I bought one the next day and tried it out

Within 20 minutes (there was an initial update to download), I was connected to my wireless network and could access netflix and youtube on my phone and cast to the Chromecast

Perfect! Now I can just keep this in my purse and pull it out when I need it.The really cool thing is it's ability to stream your own media


 Now this does take some setup, and unfortunately, file support is limited to MP4 and MKV with AAC audio, but once all your media is formatted for the Chromecast, you're golden! More information on file support is here: [...]First-off; you need to format your media

Handbrake will easily batch convert your files overnight while you sleep

For converting the audio in MKV files, MediaCoder works well
Just stream copy your video and convert the audio to AAC.Secondly, you need to get a casting app for your media


Allcast is $5, but will play your videos as long as they are on the proper format.I have a Synology NAS at home and using the DS File app, I can stream my properly formatted files from my phone with Allcast and have it playing on my Chromecast
I can also use the DS Video app and stream files directly to the Chromecast.Of course, if you don't have your own digital library, Netflix and other internet services work well

Unfortunately, Amazon Instant Video is not supported, and may never be, since Amazon is pushing their own devices now.There are a few drawbacks to the device
The most notable is that you must be connected to a wireless network that is configurable

This means that you can't use your chromecast on public wifi or a hotel, library or school
It would be nice if you could do an adhoc connection with your phone or computer to the chromecast to stream local media, but for now, that's not possible.As mentioned, the lack of file support is frustrating and if you want all of your media available to cast, it can be time-consuming to convert everything if you don't already have your media formatted correctly.There are still more potential with this device, but for $35, it's a great start.

Example, if I watch TV or a recorded show from my TIVO (CoAx connected) the audio is low. If I stream something to my TIVO from a Media share PC on my network, then the audio is normal. If I watch TV on my Roku (Component Cables)the volume is normal again.

So I looked into this little guy

I installed it on the front of my Ubuntu 10.04LTS tower, and it didn't light up or do anything

So I surfed around the net a bit on my old crusty G adapter, and found a link for some drivers for it

Once I opened up the dmg and ran TWO commands, I was in business - blue lights and all
I read that it will auto-install this adapter on first install of the OS


But, I don't know that for sure

I'm also not sure about 11.11 yet, as I don't want to upgrade to that..

Well, you can't really, so you write about your experience with the item.Let's start by warning all of you not to waste your money; spend it one something worth while.I was standing in the depths of a slot canyon, Capitol Reef National Park, when I tried to use this thing. I expanded the center section and it popped completely out...2 sections! Plastic bits fell into the red sand. For about 20 minutes I tried (carefully) to put it back together.Another section fell out, spilling its bits onto the sand. This time I just gathered what I could find and put it all back in my pack. Pretty pathetic -- you do, indeed, get what you pay for.

For the most part, when it's fully charged, it provides about four hours of battery life for his computer. Shipping was on time.
$SUMMARY.: Decent with Acer ZG5 netbook

$REVIEW.: I bought this for use with a Polar F55 heart rate monitor after my second Polar brand IrDA device failed after only one use.  This little unit was truly plug and play, worked the first time and every time since AND was half the price of the Polar unit.  With that said, it is still a bit expensive for what it is, so only 4 stars.

$REVIEW.: I chose it because it was such a bargain that I thought I'd have little to lose.  As it turns out I'm using very often it all while it's not an ultra high end tripod it gets the job done very well.  Very quick to get up and down.  A well balanced carry handle location, very lightweight.  For normal use with normal weighted cameras I have no performance complaints at all.  On the quality side, yes the fittings and hear have plastic and are on the light side but for over a month now  they ave worked flawlessly and show no signs of wear at all.  For this price I might just buy a second one on the off chance that something might break and just roll with it.  But it also my understanding that customer service has been great for other folks in the review.  It's NOT a pro stand but my camera has not known the difference.
$review_summary.: I can't get over how much I like this tripod!

$REVIEW.: Having used Android tablets, ipads, and netbooks heavily, I am impressed with how well Microsoft was able to pull this off. Windows 8 is really nice on this. I can remote into work, do school work, surf, email, and play games. It's fast and covers everything I need. I'm an IT pro, so its great to have this tablet on me.If there is a downside, I'd say it's the cameras. They're good for Skype, but just generally grainy and bad for images.There are plenty of apps. The screen is beautiful. I use the touchpad keyboard which is taking some getting used to... But its surprisingly good. I also use a Bluetooth mouse that is nice.Overall, it's a great tablet. I'd buy it again.

$review_text.: I've purchased two of these cables spaced out over about a year.  I wouldn't look at third parties with Monster cables as they seem to get a lot of negative reviews for selling knock-offs or defective units.  My most recent cable from Amazon direct didn't output any video, which is no good, but I'm still willing to give it a solid review based on my other purchase a ways back. I've since ordered a replacement from Amazon - will update this review if I receive another dud.  Perceptually, the quality of the video output is either on par with my previous high-end cable from Monoprice, or better.Rant: Ignore people's emotional reviews about this cable.  I have no idea why, but companies like Monster and Bose seem to get more reviews about the companies themselves rather than their products. Also, I'm not certain why people say there's no quality difference with cables - tell that to my Apple TV that has decided just recently that Monoprice cables are a no-go having used them successfully for years.

It's very sturdy so you don't have to worry about your television coming off and getting damaged. I gotta admit this was my first time ever installing a tv mount on a wall and you certainly don't have to be a mechanical engineer to install it. It took me maybe 15 minutes with another person helping to get it hanging. Very please with this Omnimount!!

Maximum record time was 4 min 30 seconds approximately, not 2, 5 or 10 minutes as described.3. Image was terrible, even on the highest resolution.4. Audio and video was very choppy.5. All settings would go back to default after turning back on, so I had to reprogram it every time.PROS:1.Small, hides well behind rear view mirror, so it does not block your vision from the road.2. Suction cup mount was very strong.

$review_text.: While it worked, it is a decent camcorder


 Good image under good light


Grainy image under low light
 Not very good sound if you are in a slightly crowded setting with ambient noise (like a classroom)
 We used it for recording classroom settings
 The image is clear, but does not look very real
 Whether it is played on the computer or various HD TV, the image looked like what sometimes a lousy HD TV image look out

 A bit washed out.However, like the many other 1 star reviewers, this camcorder broke inexplicably in one year
 This is the pattern of how it happened to me -1) First, I can start recording, but the stop button does not respond

 I have to keep pushing it until finally it registers.2) Then, after 1) happens frequently enough, all buttons (power, play, stop, menu) would cease to respond to anything
 I have to take out the battery to get it to restart.3) Then, 2) happens a lot, or almost every single time after power-on.4) Then, after I take the battery out and put it back in, it won't power on.This whole process took weeks to 1 - 2 months until the camcorder is completely un-usable
 I called Canon, and they are not the least bit apologetic
 I had two options, take a lousy 10% on a refurbished unit (which is priced much higher than a new unit of the same model on amazon) or pay $260 or more for repair, plus shipping.I toughed up and paid for the repair.And guess what? ..

Within 30 days, the whole cycle starts all over again

 Now I have 6 months after the repair, and the problem recurred at least half a dozen times

 I can't send it for repair earlier because the problem occurred once every few weeks


 Now I am stuck with a totally unreliable camcorder after a total of perhaps $900 in cost and repair, and I don't know when it will decide to croak.How sad for a Canon product!

$review_text.: Very nice Keyboard for Dell inspiron E1505, and I am so happy my letter H is working now.  I just picked up my keyboard out of my mailbox and install it all within 30 minutes. Actual installation was approx 15 minutes with the help of YOU TUBE. Just search Dell inspiring 6400/E1505 Keyboard replacement. This keyboard is just as good as the Dell product if not better, and as matter of fact the markings are just about identical as the original Dell Keyboard when I compared both. I actually was going to buy a new laptop because of my letter H wasn't working and didn't really think about buying a new keyboard until it was mention to me. I read the reviews for this model keyboard and Dell keyboard. Even though the Dell keyboard has a lot more reviews in comparison they were approx six 1 star ratings stating that the keyboard was cheap because the keys broke off. As far as this brand for Dell E1505 keyboard all the reviews were either 4-5 stars. Definitely worth every penny and shipping was super fast for me. So far so good and I will update this review if keyboard does not work probably in the future. You can't go wrong in any aspect of buying this product. Good Luck!

$review_text.: I listen to jazz so my comments are related to this type of music.  The MX-500's provide a very good sound when you set your iPod equilizer to "flat".  Most other settings result in a sound that is overly bright, not natural.  The MX-500 do not provide any relief from the sounds around you (unless you turn up the volume pretty high).  All that said, I do like the MX-500 better than the ear buds that came with my iPod.I bought the MX-400's also (one of those Amazon buy two and save deals).  These ear buds do not sound better than the ear buds that come standard with an iPod.

$REVIEW.: I'm back again to write a review on yet another case I just received. This time around I'll be giving you my thoughts on the EXOTEK Premier slim-fit Cover Case.I will be comparing this case to my previously reviewed case; the KAYS case [...]The quality of the EXOTEK is leaps and bounds better than the KAYS.  Not only the construction of the case itself, but it is also much more thought out feature wise.  All of my grips with the KAYS have been answered.For one...I love the little fingers that hold the tablet in place in oppose to the slide in of the KAYS,  Mainly because I have full access to the tablet screen now.  I was difficult at times to pull down the menu or get to the left and right sides of the tablet because the KAYS case came right the edge of the screen.[...]All of the ports and button are very easily accessible.  Also, the magnetic smart cover is in place and works like a dream.  The case itself is very slim. I would say about half the thickness of the KAYS case.Overall I am extremely pleased with this case.  It will definitely be my daily for the time being until something better possibly comes out.Here is a link to the EXOTEK case on Amazon ( [url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008MIQGTQ/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00]Amazon.com: EXOTEK Premium Slim-Fit Folio Cover Case With Multi-Angle Stand For Google Nexus 7 Tablet (With Automatic Sleep/Wake Function) (Black): Computers & Accessories[/url] ) At $6.95 it is an absolute steal IMO.Happy shopping.

$REVIEW.: I bought this processor for a gaming only rig.  I have it paired with an ASRock Z77 Pro4-M, 8GB DDR3-1333 RAM and a Radeon HD 7770.  The machine works flawlessly.  Every game I've tried I'm running at the highest graphics settings with no issues.For the majority (I'd say 95% just to throw out a number) of apps and games the i5 provides more than enough power.  The reality is most applications are not designed/optimized to use 6-8 cores/threads so you gain no real performance advantages.  That is why the i7 only score very marginally higher than the i5 in game benchmarks; few things can/do make use of the i7s extra power.Most gamers feel like 30FPS is "playable" and 60+ is optimal and the i5 might do 1-3 FPS less than the i7.Bottom line ... if you want the best gaming CPU (and its overkill for most everything else except high-end video editing/graphics work) ... get this one.

$review_text.: For  $20  this tiny thing does a remarkable job.  I use it mostly as a radio and I give the radio 5 stars:  sensitive, loud, good presets.  The MP3 player works OK.  It does not always remember the place it stopped and reading the titles on the tiny screen can be a challenge.  Only two drawbacks. (1) The keystrokes involved to do anything are numerous,  complex, and not always obvious or logical.  I sometimes found myself pushing buttons randomly to find if I can get anything to happen.  But, once you figure things out it becomes kind of a reflex. (2) A more serious issue  is battery usage.  Even turned off it uses up a battery in a week.  When it is on,  it eats them like candy.  I just take the battery out when I am not using it. In spite of these issues, , I have had many small radio/mp3 players and this one really is one of the best.  It has  a great price, no annoying wires to lose, it fits in your pocket,  and it has a USB key to boot.  Get two!

$REVIEW.: First thing you notice is the very well and solid build of this PSU.I live in Dubai and this PSU was shipped all the way from Amazon to New York then through a courier to me in Dubai, honestly I expected that something maybe wrong with it because of the rough journey, but once plugged it in and switched my PC on, it ran flawlessly and super silent! At least I thought the fan bearings might have moved but touch-wood :)It is an auto sensing 100 - 240 volts, means there is no flip button for voltage convert and you can plug it anywhere in the world.In the box along with the PSU comes the power cable and a PCI-E converter.One more thing I would like to share with you, I thought of buying the $15 - $25 more expensive 700 Watts modular PSU (also from Tt), but then it crossed my mind: heck at the end I will purchase a second graphics for SLI and will be using `almost' all the PSU cables, then  what's the benefit? Nothing much! So I preferred to go for $15 cheaper but with 50 extra watts to spare which made more sense for me.
$SUMMARY.: Very well made, super silent

$review_text.: I have Windows 8.1 Pro.  I installed the driver that came on the included CD.  If successful It will add 2 items to your device manager.  A Line USB Audio Device, and a USB 2861 Device to &#34;sound video and game controllers&#34;.Heed the following advice:1) The included software (Corel video studio) has too many quirks to be useful.  I found it defaulted to sampling at some low resolution... maybe 320x200...  if you increased it to NTSC at 720x480, the video would stop saving properly in the middle.  I did get it to work for 2 hours at 320x200... but who wants decreased video?  Also it defaults to S-Video, and you have to switch to composite before your video will even save at all...2) The included USB cable extension causes even more problems...  DO NOT USE THE ADDITIONAL EXTENSION CORD3) Download VLC Media Player.  It is open source and will work with the driver.  You will be using the Media-&#62;Convert/Save option.  In the file settings it defaults to saving MP4 files with a sound format that will not play by default in windows media player...though maybe in other players I did not try...  Change the sound codec to MP3 and everything will be fine.  Also check the &#34;de-interlace&#34; option for a nice finish.  in the video size text box type in 720x480 to get the correct res... there is no drop down box...Cheers!

Initially, I didn't want to purchase the dolly because I saw the words "Lightweight Aluminum Construction" in the technical details, but the frame of this dolly is solid. Additionally, the actual motion of rolling the camera is smooth. I like this tripod dolly and I think it can give some of the upper tier dollies a run for there money.

$review_text.: NOTE: You will not get surround sound with these headphones on the Xbox One

 This is not the fault of the headphones, but rather with the Xbox One console.The Turtle Beach Titanfall headset is very comfortable and should feel great for long gaming sessions
 The padding on top of the headset will make it more comfortable, but it could have used better padding all around


 The microphone is removable, so you can use it just as a headset if you are not going to chat

 I like this feature quite a bit, but it could be a problem for kids, as they are prone to losing things.This headset has additional connection cables for the Xbox 360, so it is a multi-system, multi-function device that will work with both consoles, and with mobile devices.The sound quality is really good and doesn&#8217;t seem terribly bass heavy in presentation, so you can hear everything that is going on around you
 A great feature of these headphones is the ability to use them as regular headphones, as you can plug the standard mini plug into your iPod, phone, tablet, etc

and use them

 This is great, as it makes them a multi-purpose purchase instead of something that is simply for gaming

 The sound is certainly not as good as Grado or Sony MDR-7506 for music, but they are not bad at all and should be great for most people, especially those who will use them for multiple purposes

 The headset is capable of producing a very loud volume, so please be careful and protect your hearing.The headset comes with the adapter necessary to use the headphones with the new XBOX One controller, but you must update your controller before they will work
 This is a simple process that can be done in a couple of minutes:Connect your controller to your Xbox One console with a USB cable.Open the Settings application.Select System.Select Update Controller.The controller will be updated after this process is completed, but I was prompted for another update when the headset was actually plugged into the controller

 Be sure to do both, as I don&#8217;t know what will happen if you cancel the second one.Bottom Line: 4 stars - recommended.

 I've used these in all the mentioned scenarios and really was impressed at the image quality and focusability


 The only drawback I have found so far is that the case is a tight fit for all the pieces (binocs, strap, eye cup, etc) but for me it didn't matter because I always had a fanny pack or day pack with me as well to put the binocs in.

$REVIEW.: Though I don't consider myself a professional photographer (since I do not make my living from photography), I upgraded from a Canon EOS 7D to the 5D Mark III about 9 months ago, and have thoroughly enjoyed the additional photographic opportunities that have opened up to me. Just a few of the compelling features on this solid, workhorse of a camera:- Superior low light performance; you can shoot comfortably with high ISO settings, knowing that you will get useable results (pair it with an f2.8 or f1.8 lens and this camera can see in the dark !)- Fast, accurate auto focusing- Silent shooting mode; no one will know you're even in the room- Auto bracketing of up to 7 images (the crop sensor models only permit 3 images)- Big bright display- Very useful Quick Menu to navigate through settings readily and view camera status at a glance- Comfortable grip- Long battery life; quick charge cycleIn addition, the 24-105mm F/4 L kit lens is a great walk-around lens; versatile whether you're shooting landscapes or portraits. It rarely leaves my camera.The camera has accompanied me on countless trips and photo outings. I have shot at least 40,000 images in the 9 months that I've owned it, and I have some fantastic images to document my travels. I have not had a single issue with the camera and am perfectly satisfied that I made the best decision. Everywhere I go, people comment on how impressive the camera is and state that I must be a "pro" - after which they say that they're satisfied with the images from their cell phones and point & shoot cameras; I just smile and nod, smug with the satisfaction that they don't even know what they're missing :)

$review_text.: The USB cord is soldered to the internal circuit card, a negative IMHO because it's only about a foot long
 It needs a USB port so I can use any cord.There were no instructions, which may be a blessing compared to similar Chinese instructions

Hard to say.The top half is plastic and the bottom half is metal with no rubber anti-skid feet


The two halves are fitted together using tangs in the metal half that lock into the plastic upper half

 There is also a front and back for the metal base which takes some study to figure out or it blocks the slot in the drive.There are zero screws holding the drive in alignment with the disk loading slot in the case

 Using a drive from a 2011 Macbook Pro, it took many iterations of dis-assembly and re-assembly to put bits of foam and rubber in just the right place to get things lined up.Dis-assembly to test the fit required considerable prying and marring to get the case apart
 Even then it could not eject a disk because the base also affects how the drive aligns with the slot
 MANY iterations later I think I have it, but am not sure it's a reliable fix.I tried the other all-plastic case on Amazon but it is for tray-loaders only

In the end I wish I had gotten the high priced case for the MBP drive at Other World Computing
 But at their price it's only a few bucks more to get a Blu-ray USB drive and call it a day.

$review_text.: There are a lot more expensive memory cards on the market, but after nearly five years of using PNYs, I'm convinced they're among the best bargains. Unless you're a professional videographer who needs high-speed memory processing between camera and card, the 8GB PNY card is all you'll need. As a professional photographer using high-end DSLR cameras in what are often demanding conditions, I depend on these cards to operate glitch-free. Don't be fooled by the promises of other manufacturers who charge far more for their memory cards. The higher prices are usually necessary to cover their big advertising budgets.

$REVIEW.: Love the Power Xtreme! Received mine last week and have had a few chances to use it now... it reminds me of a turtle shell, I have a few more of New Trent's battery packs but this one I trust my husband with!  He is out in the elements and dust & whatnot... this powerpak took his Galaxy S4 from 1% battery to about half in no time.  He is a truck driver and ALWAYS on the phone!  With this powerpak it can sit in his pocket with a cord long enough to reach his phone up to his ear or on it's holster and give it a good quick charge no matter what he's doing.  I love the fact that it's so protected.  It opens up on the bottom to plug it in, and the on off switch is just as protected under the shell of the case. And believe me when I tell you it's easy to clean dirt, grease and whatever off of this turtle shell case!  This power pak is a MUST for anyone out in the elements or anyone that gets dirty,  greasy and grimy that needs to keep control over his/her phone - tablet -computer ect!  With this powerpak you are totally in a win win situation!

 But I don't see that as an issue since its not designed to be moved about a lot.I run a dual R9 270x2 crossfire in this case and the airflow keeps them nice and cool.I have owned a few cases over the years and I can see this one staying with me for some time.

$review_text.: Guess I should say that this bluetooth speaker's sort of growing on you! First, I wonder what the point was to have an extra speaker phone when your smart phone is capable of just about anything this device could offer and more. Then as I used it more, I start to like it.First, it worked like your office's conference phone. You can really hold a conference call with this. Audio and clarity is superb, the other end wouldn't even know you are talking on a speaker phone. It also works as external speaker; videos and music sound much better on this speaker than your phone's built-in speaker. No Bose quality, but good enough to enjoy a good movie. There is a headphone jack, so you can plugged in your headset. OK...again, nothing that your smartphone like an iPhone wouldn't have, just works a little better. One thing is it work great in the car. Better than my car bluetooth speaker phone.Connect the speaker to your phone is simple, if the bluetooth light is not on (it goes into bluetooth connect mode the first time you turn it on), hold down the bluetooth button for a couple seconds, then the speaker will announce its mode. Hold down the power button a few seconds to turn it off. There is volume up/down button and on/off hook button. Another word, it is a full feature speaker phone. About the only this speaker phone needs is a LED display. But then, you have it on your phone already!As I mentioned,  I have some reservation at first, but now I love it.

Sony said they will send out a box and I can ship it back to them for repair, a 4-5 week process. I decided to just return to Amazon. Will use refunded money for XB1 and wait on a PS4 after a bad launch experience. I am a gamer, far from a fanboy of any consoles. I have bought almost all my consoles on launch day and this was a bad experience. I'm very disappointed. Please check out other forums, esp the official forums on the Sony Playstation page, for more stories of non-working consoles. Quite a few have been from Amazon, so they might have gotten a bad batch.Here is a link to the bundle I bought from Amazon, showing that it was a VERIFIED purchase: http://www.amazon.com/review/RCUV1SVDKN3V2I received full refund from Amazon, was shipped back this morning (11/16) Not sure why some reviewers are claiming Amazon denied their return/refund, unless they changed their minds after all the consoles being sent back.

$review_text.: I bought this item used from a seller on amazon and I have to say I am impressed. The unit is light and easy to travel with. I paired it with my E63 without any hassles at all and like magic it started to provide that valuable information required. Tested it out against a couple other units, more expensive one and the accuracy of this little item was well within the tolerance limits. Battery (though used) is providing great life. Kept it on for a good 13 hours and it still had juice in it. Well worth it. Great product.

$review_text.: With the built-in WiFi in my Netbook I could see other routers in my apartment building. With this thing plugged in (Windows 7 Update automatically found, downloaded & installed a driver in a couple of minutes), I soon saw a list of routers which must have included my entire neighborhood!If you have a Dual-Band router (2.4 & 5.0 GHz), you'll need a Dual-Band WiFi adapter in order to utilize the maximum potential and this adapter is NOT Dual-band, but if your happy with Wireless N (2.4 GHz, up to 300Mpbs) and just need more range to pick-up your router throughout your whole house/estate, this'll most likely do it for ya!
$SUMMARY.: Awesome range!  B/G/N Not Dual-band

$REVIEW.: My daughter just got a new Kindle Fire HD so assumed this would fit it, since it says it only does not fit the older models, but hers has an extremely hard time popping into the case and won't stay there.  Aside from that, the design and colors are nice (her two favorite colors), and it has the thickness/stability of her previous pink case, which also is made to fit by just popping her Kindle in.  Only this one does not pop together as easier as her old case and she's not a fan of the shape/grip on it.  Would not recommend, many better cases!

$review_text.: I have to admit that I typically use Tiffen filters for my lenses as I'm at best a casual photographer. However, I recently invested in a Nikon 18-200mm lens and while Amazon had it for $600 (instead of the regular $900), that is still the most I had ever spent on a lens. Given how expensive it was, I figured I would listen to the reviewers who said &#34;don't put a $10 Tiffen on a $900 lens&#34;. This made extra sense as the 18-200 will probably be the lens that I use the most going forward.So I went with the Hoya and I am very glad I did. This thing is crystal clear. When I opened the case I thought maybe they had just sent me the filter rim (?) because it was so clear. I am pretty confident that this filter will not have any effect on the beautiful shots from my new lens (which is how it should be). To boot, I can rest assured that my expensive lens is adequately protected from scratches etc. Completely satisfied and I'll probably start replacing my other Tiffens with Hoyas now that I see what a big improvement in quality they are.

$REVIEW.: I recently switched from Nikon to Fuji and had to change my wireless triggers. I purchased some Cowboy Studio triggers and they just would NOT work with the Fuji XE-2, which was very frustrating. So I sold them off and purchased the Phottix Ares triggers. The Ares are built so much better and have worked flawlessly on my last 2 shoots. I've been very happy with these triggers so far. I'll update my review if something happens in the future.

$review_text.: 3.0 ready (as  stated on ADATA package) does not equate to 3.0 speed. I tested the write speed against a PNY 2.0 flash drive by transferring 1.000+ photos (about 4G) to the two drives. The files took 6 minutes 37 seconds with the ADATA drive and 6 minutes 28 seconds with the PNY 2.0 drive.After additional research, the reason is that ADATA is at most a quad/4-channel controller. To get better speed, look for 8-channel controller (LaCie). It's more expensive, but that's the reason - if you want the speed, you'll have to pay more. Don't bother with the ADATA - you'll be disappointed.The OS is Windows 7 Ultimate on a one-year old gaming PC (intel i7 2.67 GHz; 12G RAM). The ADATA was plugged directly into a Western Digital PCIe USB 3.0, 2 port card.

$REVIEW.: I needed this little adapter for the optical out.  Now I can get digital 5.1 and still use my hdmi for video output.  There are two minor annoyances, but not enough for me to knock off a star.  I had to jiggle my optical cord from the output side of the adapter because it wasn't producing any sound.  It only took a second to fix and it stays in place so its not an issue.  The second annoyance is that the adapter head connecting to the xbox side MIGHT still be big enough to be pushing up against some hdmi cords.  It still works as it should with both hdmi and adapter pushing against each other, but some people may be annoyed that there isn't any space between them.  I have 2 hdmi heads of different sizes, so I just plugged in the smaller one.  So now I have some space between the two connectors when plugged in.  I also haven't tried the analog left/right connections, so I can't comment on that.It works so I'm happy with this purchase!

$review_text.: Last year, I was able to try a previous Sony Bloggie product and now this year, they introduced the Bloggie Live

This time it has a touch screen and they say you can instantly load your videos and photos onto the website of your choice.I really like the touch screen feature

I found it really easy to navigate around

The thing I like about the Bloggie cameras is that they are pretty simple to use, at least to me, that I don't need to sit down and read pages and pages of directions to be able to understand how to work a product.The one big fail about the product and why I couldn't decide on whether or not to give this review 3 or 4 stars is the whole loading pictures and video to websites

I can't get it to load anything onto Facebook

Every time that I tried, it told me that an error occurred and to please try again later
That was a big letdown seeing as Facebook is the only place, at the moment, where I would want to load my videos onto


It's kind of bad when it seems that this is basically why Sony introduced this product.But to me the quality of the photos and video are excellent


The colors in the photos are vibrant


The video is pretty nice


I took video of fireworks at the Fourth of July and the sound and video quality is not bad

So it kind of stinks that I can instantly upload things that I record on this camera onto sites like I should, but I still like this camera.

$review_text.: I'm going to preface this review by stating that I live in Manhattan, New York City. I mention this because most of the high-def TV signals broadcast by the local networks are originating from the top of the Empire State Building on 34th Street -- which means I am only four miles from the signal source. The performance of this antenna is obviously going to vary depending on the user's location (urban vs. rural) and distance from the signal source, so I want people reading this review to understand the context of my situation using this thing, since their particular circumstances will likely be different.That having been said, I live on the 14th floor of an apartment building with an exposure to the Southeast. What I like about this antenna: A) it is small - about 14 inches high and 4 inches wide; and B) it looks much nicer than "rabbit ear" or square metal "grid" antennas, and is perfect for indoor use. I have it hooked up to a Samsung DTBH260F HDTV terrestrial receiver, which decodes the signal. All I need to do to get great reception is just place the antenna on top of my living room window sill (inside my apartment) when I want to watch TV. That's it -- no mounting on a pole or hanging it from a string. Reception is great -- I'm watching the 2010 FIFA World Cup on Univision (41) and the reception is excellent. When I'm finished watching, I just remove the antenna from the window sill, wrap the RF cable line around it and store it unseen in a corner. That's my experience using this antenna; hope this helps.

The new 7 is all about the screen,  love the resolution, i really enjoy reading on it, i still believe 8 inches should be the perfect size but 7 will do. This is a fast efficient and great tablet to have, aloows me to work and play with ease. its size allows it to be carried efforlessly. So far ive had no issues with mine so far. I love the speed, stability and screen. Overall its what i expected and more. can;t go worng with it. Also i do use it a bit more than the ipad just because android seems more to my liking.

First tried installing a serial card into the PC tower (it used the same Prolific chipset) but the computer would not assign a COM port to the serial card
Had to return it back to the store and tried to research another solution
Most of the usb-to-serial adapter cables on Amazon rated poorly, except for this one.Based on the positive reviews, I decided I'd give this adapter cable a try
After receiving the driver CD and cable that comes in a box, follow the installation instructions (the sequence, as indicated) and the computer should assign a COM port number
This adapter was immediately recognized by the computer and it worked with the GPS device to connect onto Google Earth!Very highly recommended.

No volume control which is bad too.On the other hand, they are super-comfortable and fit really nicely and stay on for the long haul. Sound is good and the one-button on the wire lets you turn on/off music and take calls. Wire is decent size, but wish it was a little bigger -- maybe a couple more feets.They work for me and do what I want them to do except the sound leaking part. So I would recommend!

I'm writing this review based on the fact that I also ordered another screen protector (same brand) for my HTC One phone and the quality of their products is simply amazing. I love the fact that they include not just one, but three screen protectors for the HTC One just in case you mess up the first one.On the other hand, the other amazing thing is definitely their customer support. They contacted me via email to see how satisfied I was with their products. I explained how I mistakenly had ordered the wrong screen protector. The lady I spoke with was very helpful every step of the way and decided to send me an additional screen protector that fits my Samsung Galaxy model at no charge. I didn't have to send the other one back because I had already open the package it comes in. Customer support and product quality is equally amazing!!!

$REVIEW.: I'm mostly using this on an Android phone running autosketch.  Over all, this stylus is pretty good when compared to other styluses on the market, but it isn't much better than simply using my pinky finger.  I've messed around with it for drawing and stuff, but find the finger more available and just as precise.  Women and youngsters, having smaller fingers than mine, will be even more precise.I may be a bit too demanding though.  I was envisioning something like a wacom tablet with that precise little pen with the controls and stuff that allow you to almost airbrush.  Basically, I need a button to turn the drawing function on and off.  Any other controls for circle radius and stuff are icing on the cake, but I really do need that button.  It's my preferred style.Gotta keep trying - maybe that preferred technique will change.

$REVIEW.: Some have argued over the Total Harmonic Distortion.Most consumer amps start to overdrive around 12 oclock, if not sooner.I chose this in lue of plastic powered computer speakers.I am running 2 Boston A60s on my desk.Compared to all the powered computer speakers put out by the main brands,nothing can come close to your own HI FI bookshelf speakers, if they are in good shape.This small amp works wonders at lower volume levels. It seems volume levels up to 10 oclock are clean.Keep in mind, if your speakers are on your desk, the volume doesn't need to rock the whole room.And, you don't need find a place to put your old 20 pound bulky 80 watt receiver.This thing is tidy, and looks good on your desktop.I put some rubber feet on mine.
$review_summary.: It works and looks nice!

$review_text.: I could't be happier with my purchase of the Coby MIDI 7065-8 Tablet. It feels well built and actually came with a little manual that many will find helpful. I'm very impressed with how responsive this tablet is. The touch screen is very responsive and the dual core 1.2 ghz processor coupled with the 1 gig of ram make opening and using multiple apps a breeze. Set up was a cake walk and I had this up and running and connected to my wifi in less than 10 minutes from the time I began unboxing it.I've always considered myself a power user when it comes to technology and as such this little unit did not disappoint. While it's not a higher cost tablet it still had all the features I was looking for specifically an expansion slot for more memory. While I use the cloud I abore being completly limited by it. One thing to point out is the lack of a rear facing camera on this tablet. For me that was not an issue as I don't think a tablet is the best device for picture taking.I bought a OTG cable so that I could utilize my USB thumb drives and have had no issues getting them to work. That little addition gives this unit near unlimited storage capacity. A very happy thing.One last thing is that the Google Play store worked flawlessly for me. I did find a few apps that weren't compatible with this tablet but very few. Most of those were very specific apps such as the one for my small town bank and I suspect they might not be compatible with and even more expensive tablet.As for the WIFI some reviews expressed concerns on the strength and quality of their connections, I experienced none of those issues. The unit connects quickly, with good strength and stays connected.In conclusion if you are like me and tend to look to get the most bang for your buck then by all means buy this unit. On the other hand if you are more concerned with what name is on your electronics then this probably isn't the tablet for you. Just remember that you should never judge a book by it's cover.*****************45 DAYS**********************So I thought I would come back now that I've had this tablet for 45 days and give you an update on my state of satisfaction. I am still completly happy with this device. It has done everything I have asked of it with no issues. The only think I have encountered was when I tried to update the Kindle app. It said that a previous version existed and that the signatures did not match. I couldn't uninstall it because it was a system app. I still haven't figured out a work around but to be honest I haven't tried to hard. The version of the Kindle app on my Coby works fine when reading books so upgrading is not that big a deal and certainly does not change the high regard I have for this device. I asked myself if I would purchase this device again and the answer was yes. You can not beat the number of features this device even at a higher price point. If you are looking for a low cost tablet that works well and is loaded with features lacking in some more expensive devices then this is the tablet for you.
$SUMMARY.: Very Happy

$REVIEW.: Have tried this thing in two cars. It is essentially unusable. A frequency will "work" ( very poor reception, lots of static that changes when you move the cable around) for a few minutes, then fade. It is NEVER clear sounding. Shades of 1960's TV with rabbit ear antennas and aluminum foil.Mr. Ballmer, you really should refund my money for this piece of crap. It is a piece of junk at $10, but for what I paid? Insulting.

$review_text.: Overall this system is extremely fast and powerful. It is as close to 5 stars as I would get but have to round down to 4 for some issues I will go into detail about below. But overall I am very happy with my purchase. I had been using an HP Envy 15 3040nr with 8GB RAM 2nd Gen Intel Core i7 at 2.2 Ghz, and Windows 7. This system literally feels 10 times faster at all things.The Good-The power/specs of this are hard (impossible?) to beat at this price, I've been running 24 hours moving hundred+ gigabytes of data on and around the drives with no BSODs or serious errors despite throwing everything I have at it, I'm not the biggest gamer in the world but for comparison I installed the new Sim City with absolute max graphics at max resolution and the game FLIES! It moves so fast compared to my older HP model I have to set the game on the slow speed just so the cars don't look ridiculous moving down the roads, There is absolutely no lag and the screen moves as fluid as can be, This was with a number of file copy operations and 2 web browsers open with 10+ tabs each and Microsoft Live Mail as well running in the background. I cannot say enough how well this handles heavy computing tasks. It does so while remaining very quiet and fairly thin for its size.The Bad-Here's my main issue, and it is an issue with a lot of laptops out there. Only the top of the line HP Envy, Sony, and Macbook Screens create an image that truly satisfies me. Putting this laptop side by side with my HP Envy 15 which uses the best display technology in modern use - Radiance" IPS - and you would think the HP laptop was several generations more advanced than the ASUS. Colors are far more vivid and the contrast in photographs is phenomenal compared to this ASUS. I know I was spoiled- when you get used to "The Best" any change, no matter how good it may be in its own right, is a let down. I know in time I will get used to my ASUS display and forget what I am missing, but man with them side by side it makes me sad that this is what I will be looking at for the next couple years (assuming it doesn't break.) I feel at this price the laptop display quality should be of paramount importance to the manufacturer. It is the window through which everything else is judged.My other issues are more minor but annoying none the less- There is no knob or even dedicated buttons to raise/lower/mute the volume. You need to press the fn key PLUS one of the function keys to change the volume, or of course use the mouse by the clock. This is the first laptop I've ever had that I can recall that didn't have a dedicated means of changing the volume apart from the keyboard.Now to get really petty- The backlit keyboard- if you're not sitting with your head high above the keyboard- if you tend to look at the keyboard from a low angle like me, the back-lighting is almost useless. The bright white LEDs "leak" from around the keys at this angle and drown out the symbols on the keys themselves. Ideally the keys would be thicker or set deeper into the keyboard to prevent all this light from leaking out.This is about it for now, I will update if anything major changes in the next few months. Overall I do recommend this laptop but wish the display quality was better.Oh - one more plus- thank you to whoever designed the power-cord to plug into the laptop at a right angle. My HP laptop had the power input in the same spot (right side of laptop, to the rear) and it had a straight power cord, which meant 3 or 4 wasted inches on the right side of the machine I couldn't put anything next to it. I actually ended up buying my own right angle adapter for the HP. So happy to see this model the right angle is built in.---2 and a half month follow-up- All is going well- upgraded to Windows 8.1 without issue- still running like a champ!

$REVIEW.: I purchased this TV from a local store that had it on sale so that a friend could use it for a while until he is able to get his stuff (and his TV) back from his previous state of residence
 It displays a 1080p signal just fine using a Playstation 3
 Not that it matters a whole lot on a set this small, as most people tend to sit so far away from their TV's that they wouldn't even notice the difference


 For the price that you're paying for this TV, the PQ is impressive


 It won't compare to higher-end brands in the $300+ range, but it's terrific for it's going rate, and under
 I will be using this as a bedroom TV after I get it back from my friend.The sound almost made me throw up though

 I can't believe there are worse tv speakers out there than this, but one of the top reviewers of this set here on Amazon says there are

 If the volume is turned up to a decent volume level then everything sounds super high pitched and shrill-like


 Turned down too low the vocals and sound effects get hard to distinguish from

 There's no real middle ground on this set
 I've heard better audio coming out of 10" tablets.If you're looking for a cheap 32" HDTV with great picture quality, this is it

 The main selling points for me at the time were the extremely small bezel around the screen, and how light this thing is
 I expected the TV to weigh more than it does, and so it was a pleasant surprise when I was able to move it around without any real effort


 This TV looks great running its out-of-the-box energy savings mode, which I tweaked by disabling extra's like dynamic contrast and other garbage that artificially "enhances" the picture
 I put enhances in quotes because it's extra fluff that shouldn't be enabled to begin with

 You don't see that stuff being utilized in movie-theater projector rigs, so why have it on consumer televisions?

$REVIEW.: I have a couple of these memory sticks and wanted this one to increase the memory for music on my Samsung Galaxy X4 Mini

It boats a 32GB memory which would do me just fine

It comes with two connectors, one being a standard USB which you plug in your computer or laptop etc
Download what you want and then you can use it as a memory store for you tablet or smart phone


The other end has a standard connector for smart phones and both have protective and retractable plastic covers to add protection.It is easy to load information on as it auto registers with your computer
However, when it comes to being recognised by the phone you need to check compatibility
SanDisk have a helpful website for this, but there are some work arounds

There is free app on Play and Google that allows easy recognition....

That is if they will actually download - I had real problems with that, but that is not the fault of SanDisk


The other downside is this sticks out of the end of your phone making it look and feel clumsy so not something you would want to have in a pocket etc.Still it is incredibly compact and I have one that is 8GB and is roughly the same size

That said a memory card is a lot less obtrusive and you can get on for the same money so that is what I am going for next.



$review_summary.: Compact, Big Memory Stick, but Check Compatibility.

$REVIEW.: Love the look and feel of the camera, but the one we received does not take acceptable pictures in daylight. Washed out and overexposed in all modes. Sent to Canon for repair - stated 7 day turnaround but still waiting after 14 days. Should have returned it to Amazon..........8/30/12 UPDATE - Repair comments from Canon indicated "the adjustment of the optical assembly and exposure was incorrect. Electrical adjustments were made". Unfortunately it still takes overexposed photos, so it's back to Canon for more repairs. This time they are paying the postage.9/21/12 UPDATE - Returned to Canon for a 2nd time, this time Canon paid for the postage. Optical assembly was replaced and the camera was returned in 8 days. Picture quality is much improved. In the interim purchased a Canon SX40 and absolutely love it. If you can handle the larger form factor and like a fabulous zoom, try the SX40 or similar models.

$REVIEW.: These have gotten cheap enough to set up as birdfeeder cams or fishtank cams - WPS makes them easy to set up (with an Asus RT-66u, just hit the WPS page, or hit the button on the back, then hit the button on the DCS-930L for a few seconds, and it's live.)  Just be sure to UPGRADE THE FIRMWARE as soon as you get it online; it's easy to do, but the firmware as-shipped is ludicrously buggy, https basically doesn't work until you've done the upgrade.

$review_text.: Pros: The screen has great colors, great blacks, and a fast refresh rate for gaming. The monitor is stylish. In general, it looks very, very nice.Cons: The touch controls are hit or miss, and it's hard to "push" the button sometimes. This isn't something I do often, so not a big deal. The stand is a bit flimsy and plastic, so make sure to have it on a sturdy surface. Doesn't tilt very much up or down, but should be enough for most desks. Sometimes doesn't come out of sleep mode when the computer turns it back on, but I'm not sure if this is my video card or the monitor - right now I solve it by turning the monitor off and back on.

$REVIEW.: I bought this because I was tired of constantly changing batteries on the Apple track pad.  I reviewed the product before buying and initially tried to get by without the drivers but that wasn't really a good idea.  If you're considering this track pad, you really do need to install the drivers in order for it to work right.That said, it took some getting used to.  The sensitivity of the left-click and &#34;Gestures&#34; features isn't as sensitive as the Apple track pad.  For example, the left-click mouse feature, it takes much more pressure to click the left mouse button and even to hold it than it does on the Apple track pad.  Additionally, when using gestures, they sometimes don't register and regardless whether you have the &#34;Tap to Click&#34; feature enabled or not, it may arbitrarily treat a mis-tap on the track pad as a Tap to Click action causing other challenges.Its not bad, I don't have to keep changing batteries but I have started using the Apple Magic Mouse with the track pad because its accuracy just isn't consistent.I am disappointed, was hoping for a much better device than Apples, expected it anyway from Logitech, they just really didn't deliver.

 The color is bright and contrast is amazing


 I have taken some shots, backlit by the sun, that you'd never get away with, using most lenses.I bought the L4 lens as opposed to the bigger 2.8, for cost and size reasons

 The L4 is small enough that you can hand-hold it for most shots

$review_text.: I love this mount for my Escort radar detector.  It mounts very nicely underneath my rear view mirror of my 2012 Acura TL and helps conceal it from thieves.  I think one thing they always look for is the suction cup mark on the windshield; even if you hide the radar detector in your glove box, it's a dead giveaway that it's hiding in there somewhere when they see the suction cup mark.  Note that this mount does not include the cables you need to power the radar detector.  I bought those separately and hooked them into the rear view mirror so I didn't have to run wires a long way and I didn't have to have stock power cable dangling down to the power source.  The combination of this mount and the separate power cables made this a nice, clean installation that I don't ever need to fiddle with.  One extra thing I always do when I park in a public place is put up the windshield sunscreen.  This completely hides the radar detector.  It may look silly, especially at night, but it really helps hide it well.

I expected to have problems with the shutter lock (for bulb mode) as others have reported, but I've had no such issues


The lock does 'feel' a little weak, so the problem might develop after more usage


All in all, this is a very well built remote, I'm impressed with the build quality, esp since it's $30 cheaper than most of the competing timer remotes.While I hope it doesn't develop issues with the shutter lock, because it's nice to be able to carry one remote, I find that I don't use the timer remote for the same task that would require bulb mode
Since an aftermarket RS-60E3 remote can be had for less than $5 USD, which is much smaller and requires no batteries, I'm not too worried about it.

$REVIEW.: I have a Garmin e-trex GPS as a backup for my sailboat navigation system so my use of handheld systems has been limited to marine use only
 At first I thought this Magellan Trinton 400 system would be a good handheld for marine use

 Then I changed my mind.1


 Yes, this 400 is in color..

but the battery life is half that of my e-trex and I would much prefer longer battery life than a color screen

 This is personal bias of course and may not be of importance to you.2
 I noted the 400 was much larger than my old e-trex and seemed "clunkier".3


 However, the biggest frustration was attemping to link the 400 with my boat's navigation program on my laptop
 I simply wasn't able to link and their website help page was close to worthless
 Never was able to link
 My e-trex links right away.4

 I should have been able to download marine charts to the 400 but after several hours on their website, I was also unable to do this.5


 Finally, it was discouraging to google "Triton 400" and find so many negative comments about the unit and Magellan's support.For land use, other than the short battery life, it might present a decent option


 But for marine use, I'll stick with my Garmin e-trex.

$review_text.: UPDATE 10/19/2013: Well, I am going to have to drop this rating even further to 2 stars because another problem has come up. Several keys are starting to pop up and when you strike them they do not appear on the screen unless you tap them several times.I would definitely not recommend this product.UPDATE 12/17/2012: Unfortunately, I am going to have to drop this to 4 stars because of a glitch I have encountered continuously for the past 4 or 5 days. Three or 4 times a day (depending on how much I use it), it just stops typing....i.e., I type and nothing shows up on the screen. I merely unplug the connection, put it back in and then it works fine.It's too much trouble to send it back, and besides, I really like it....so, I will put up with the fly in the ointment.END OF UPDATEI wish I could give this product 10 stars! It is the best keyboard I have ever had, and granted, I have never owned one over 50 bucks before. Nevertheless, this one rocks!It is whisper quiet except for the sound of my fingers tapping the keys. No giggly, noisy keys. The keys are wide and easy to type and the response to the typing is fast. I haven't seen any benefit from the background lighting yet because I always have bright lites on when I type, but it is nice to know this feature is present.The only drawback is it has no "sleep" key as my last keyboard had....no biggie....I just have the PC set to "snooze" after a certain time of being idle or click "sleep" from "Start".The keyboard was actually designed in Germany and it has a 2 year warranty.

As of now the lenses look great, no scratches, all screw into each other without problems or defects. Lenses seem to be of good quality. Definitely worth the 10$ for some sexy macro shots.

$REVIEW.: I saw a lot of bad reviews for this but there were some that were positive. Having good experience with cheap Chinese stuff in the past, I decided this was worth a shot. At first, I thought everything was going well... The drivers installed fine, and it was detected as a video capture device.But unfortunately, I was unable to get any signal from it... I was able to hear audio for a few seconds using PowerDirector 12, but no video. The software included is garbage. I tried everything to get it to work but I had no luck.I was using Vista Business 32bit which actually is very friendly with old software... It can even run SimTower and other OLD games, so I did not thinl it was anything wrong with my computer.I sent it back as defective... It did not work at all even though it says its Vista compatible

$REVIEW.: I did a test indoors and outdoors, from 5, 10, and 15 ft with the wind screen on and off and all combinations of the mic settings. I am not impressed. First, without the extra sensitivity, the sound is very low. Need the +10 db just to catch up to the built in mic. The filter mode does not produce any difference I can hear. It does not improve the quality that I can notice, at least not enough to justify the cost and extra bulkiness.

$REVIEW.: I bought one of these for my car. My car's head unit allows me to hold music and movies on a USB device, which for me is easier than bluetooth connections or burning/changing CDs. This USB drive did the trick. It is barely noticable and is less likely to be damaged than a full sized drive hanging out of the dashboard. It is speedy enough to load music, movie files with no delay. With extremely long playlists song information may take a second (literally, one second) to appear fully for all songs. I have about 900 songs, a couple pictures, and several video files on it right now with a little room to spare.I can imagine that this is easily lost and could be damaged with constant use. I know many reviews have stated this. For my purpose it is not going to be moved often so I rated it 5 stars. It is perfect for laptops or devices that move around a bit but do not have much storage of their own. I have ordered a second to go with my Microsoft Surface (I broke a full sized drive in it last week!).

$review_text.: Picked one up at big box store for X-mas 2011.  Used with iPad and iPad2.  It kicked the bucket after 18 months (docking connection died. It won't charge or sync up to the iPad to play music).  We still use it as an auxiliary speaker via the included, but much too short, headphone jack wire.  A down side: the remote "input" button also seems to have crapped out so we have to manually hit the button on the back if we want to play music though the headphone input jack.*It has/had very good sound.  Also it has a small footprint / doesn't take up a whole lot of space.  It puts out some good volume and doesn't struggle to fill the room.  It was great for keeping the iPads charged up and for listening to music from pandora, etc.*Didn't like that it would automatically start playing music from either iPad as soon as we placed it on the connector. (no longer a problem...)*Remote design isn't the best (vol control vs next track should be switched - my opinion).*For all the issues I'm still considering buying another if I find it for the right price.  It was cheap the first time and for the sound quality, it was worth it to us as it fit our sound/space needs/requirements.  That said, I wouldn't really recommend it due to its lack of durability and odd bugs associated with volume control (as noted in other reviews).  We'll keep using our broken one as an auxiliary speaker until Santa finds and brings a replacement.3 stars

$review_text.: This replaces a 7-port USB 2.0 hub I've been using for five years, and after a week of being connected to a 2012 Mac mini, I haven't had any issues with the Anker hub. My old hub would sometimes cause a kernel panic when hooking it up to a Mac, so I'm very pleased that that has not happened with this new hub. I have two hard drives, a printer, and an iOS sync cable hooked up to the Anker hub.One thing that threw me off when first opening the box is how large the hub is. It stands taller than my Mac mini, but the heft is actually a nice bonus--this hub will not slide around so easily on the desk when plugging and unplugging cables or flash drives. Also, the larger size means additional spacing between the USB ports, which will be nice when trying to connect oddly shaped flash drives or other devices. The aluminum body is a nice complement to the Mac.Overall, I'm very pleased with the hub so far. I haven't tested speeds for file transfers, but I'm more of a as-long-as-it's-working person and not a it's-not-fast-enough person. I've been shopping for USB 3.0 hubs for a while, and I'm totally happy I purchased this one.

$REVIEW.: I bought this camera because it had very good reviews.  The picture quality is pretty good when there is a lot of light, but in low-light conditions there is a lot of noise in the images.  Just zoom in to any dark portion of an image and you'll see what I mean.Also, I don't know why they use the proprietary QuickTime format for video instead of standard MPEG.  QuickTime eats up too much space, and most programs can't deal with it properly.

$review_text.: I purchased this unit after trying a new Panasonic Blue Ray unit that would not connect wirelessly to my network.  I am using WEP on a 11N network, so this should not have been an issue.  Even my IPAD (not known for the best wireless reception) was able to detect and connect to my network, but the Panasonic would not.So, I ordered this 3D Blue Ray player and wonder of wonders, it connected without issue!  Of course, the first thing I did was update the unit (yes, no matter what new equipment you buy now days it seems they all need an update by the time you buy it).  Once the update was done, I proceeded to try out all of the Internet content.  The Panasonic unit had only three options for Internet connections while this Sony has more content than I know what to do with, including Internet Radio (something that I did not need since my Marantz Surround System already has that feature).  Every thing connected (after going through registration) without any problems. One big bonus of this over the Panasonic, this unit supports Amazon Prime movies!!!!!!I cannot say that I particularly like the design of the unit, but it is different.  Instead of having the normal box design, this is more of a wedge design with the widest part on top and the narrowest part on the bottom.  Also, Sony went with a glossy black finish on the unit and that also does not impress me.  The surface is a magnet for fingerprints.  However, if you only use the remote, that is not an issue.I connected the unit to a TV via HDMI that does not support 3D and thought I would see what happens when I try a 3D video.  The player is smart enough that it detects the fact that the TV is NOT 3D and tells you that you need a TV that supports 3D for the disk to work.  Put a regular Blue Ray in and the setup works just fine.The fast play feature work well and I have not run into any issues with play back on any content yet.As noted by others, the build of this unit uses plastic and the unit is very light.  So far, that does not seem to be an issue unless you are impressed with weight.I would definately recommend this unit to anyone looking for a Blue Ray or a 3D Blue Ray player that provides Internet Content as well.

$REVIEW.: This system is simply dazzling. It's little wonder the Harmon Kardon Sound Sticks were chose for the permanent collection of MOMA (Museum of Modern Art) the look is wonderfully eclectic, sleek and certainty unusual.Being a bit of an audiophile or rather a bit obsessive over sound quality for the past 45 years I've always subscribed to the philosophy that speakers are the one component of an audio system that you can't buy on specifications and should be auditioned first as each ear is different. However, this really only applies to home audio and is very difficult to do with computer speakers.Frankly I wasn't expecting to be impressed but boy was I wrong. Compared to my THX certified Logitech Z623 system which delivers a whopping 200 watts per channel - these Harmon Kardon have a much richer and defined sound. Unlike most all computer sound systems especially 2.1 systems these actually have a midrange. Along with crisp highs and the deep lows from the down firing subwoofer true stereo imaging is possible - and the sound is superb.As much as I loved keeping the subwoofer on my desk - it belongs on the floor for optimum sound quality and again back to that very sweet spot called Stereo Imagining. Some folks say you can only accomplish this with 4.1, 5.1, 7.7 set ups but I disagree. These numbers only represent the number of satellite speakers and the marketing stance is more is better but I disagree.I have two Sony Dream Machines for home theater sound and the effect is uncanny you actually here sound from behind you although no speakers are placed there. What makes this possible is a combination of multi firing speakers, digital tweeters and of course speaker placement.Some of you may be old enough to remember &#34;Quadraphonic&#34;  sound systems - these were the be and end all for high end audio systems that included four speakers but it was nonsense. Beautiful sound is dependant on the quality of the components - period.That said this system performs as good as it looks. I have found that tilting the speakers towards you and being creative with where you place them results in surprisingly excellent, rich full bodied sound.Highest Recommendation

$review_text.: i have been using the ANC3 (white one) for over a year now, i have used it on flights to china and on the trains while traveling in china.  Once the noise canceling is turned on, the ambient humming noise dropped to a much comfortable volume.  with some light music on, the humming noise disappeared completely.currently i am using it at a work site where everyone put on their headphone before entering the room, because the noise generated by the machinery is unbearable to say the least.  again i used the ANC3 with my mp3 player, crank up the volume a little and that's it.well, done with the good things about the ANC3, now the could-be-improved stuff:a. the clipper is too weak, doesn't bite the cloths or whatever you attach to firmly.  i normally attached it to the pocket on my jean but it drops off few days a day.b. the cable could be a little longer, i am 5'8", the cable is just about right when the unit is attached to my jean, however, it is a little short if the unit is hidden from the t-shirt.overall, the unit is an excellent in what is suppose to do, just wished i had gotten a black one, that would match to the mp3 player i am using.

$REVIEW.: If you have a larger power plug made in the late 90's or so for your device I found that it will cover the surrounding outlets even though they advertise that the outlets are placed specifically to allow for larger power &#34;bricks&#34; to be plugged in without that happening.  Not True.  I have a really really old surge supply that is similar to the regular tripp lite model but it is not tripp lite brand and the outlets on that are much wider placed than this tripp lite isobar and that one also has 6 outlets.There is a slight hum from this if you plug two or more devices into it.  I contacted customer support about this and their response was to send me out a new one and never actually answered my questions. I am not sure what to think about that, it was partly rude but also I got a new one free of charge sent to me so that is good I guess.Both have the same exact thing where there is a slight hum when two or more devices are plugged in so I take it that this is normal for this device. Customer Service never responded to that other than to just send me a new one, without asking by the way they just did it.  I guess they don't like questions.  Since both do the samething it must just be normal.It does NOT get hot, and there are no other issues at all.All three lights need to be on and the outer two need to be green. The center light is permanently red due to the red color being the color of the plastic cover over that light.  If two are green and the red light is lit then you are good and nothing is wrong.  If the two outer lights change color or go out then there is a problem and stop using it.I have my phone / DSL line running through the Tripp Lite and there is NO change in internet speed.  If there were then it means there is either noise being introduced OR there is resistance added in my experience.  Supposedly this Isobar is suppose to clean up line noise but that is more for the power outlets but I don't have any negative experience or degradation in internet at all.I have not tried the cat filters on this Isobar as I don't have a Television or cable.One thing that is strange is that they don't send you very many outlet covers, so if you only had one or two devices to plug in you would have uncovered outlets which if you were to drop something or something fell into one of the uncovered outlets it would take out the Isobar and potentially your equipment or could cause a fire etc...  Not sure why they don't include more outlet covers with their Isobars.Overall I am pleased with the product.  Support don't seem to like to answer questions and instead just send out new devices, is weird but you shouldn't actually need to contact support very much anyway.

$review_text.: Like the title says, I was pleasantly surprised by these headphones. The only other Bluetooth headphones I tried was the incredibly popular Motorola S305. I returned those right away because of their horrendous range, loud hissing from one of the speakers, bad pinching and discomfort, and a weird distortion effect when I moved away from the transmitter. I didn't expect the greatest when I bought the NUV2882, but I'm happy to say it has none of these issues.First things first: with cheap Bluetooth headphones, you're going to have to compromise on sound quality. A lot. These are no exception. The speaker is simply a small nub with a plastic funnel attached to it, which simply points sound in the general direction of your ears. Audio is tinny and lackluster compared to over-ear headphones and higher-end IEMs. There's no external sound dampening, but sound doesn't leak either, so you hear everything without everyone hearing you, which is awesome for doing anything outdoors.One good thing about the weird design is that it makes these headphones very comfortable. Rather than pinch your ears like your grandma did when you said a curse word, these headphones sort of hug your head while the nubs sit in your ear. I've ran, biked, and skated with these things in and they haven't budged an inch. Unlike other headphones, I can use these 3-4 hours non-stop before feeling the slightest bit of discomfort.Other thoughts: Range is great, I've gotten 30 feet in an open area without any pops or clicks. I can have my phone in my backpack and the NUV2882s blasting away without problems. Pairing is easy, like others have noted. The battery is good for ~6 hours of music playback. Build quality? What's that? These things feel like they'll fall apart if I look at them the wrong way, but their light weight is partly what makes them so comfortable. No problems with the buttons so far, however.If you're looking for a light, portable, disposable (because these probably will break), cheap Bluetooth headset for workouts and such, go with this. If you're looking for a reliable headset with good build and sound quality, look elsewhere.

 They thought it had the best picture they have seen

 I found it simple to connect to a cable TV system

 The TV was light weight and the stand was sturdy
 The stand does not allow one to rotate the TV, but that was not important to me
 Also, hardware was included to wall mount the TV.I did not like the factory settings for the picture
 After some time, I got the picture to look much better


 The picture is still not as good as I hoped, but maybe it needs a bit more tweaking

 It does look as good or better than many of the other LED-LCD TVs that I have seen.

Would highly recommend this !!I will definitely buy another one for another Moto X that I own.That being said it does add a little bulk to the phone so that is something you have to get used to.
$SUMMARY.: Excellent

$REVIEW.: After reading a ton of reviews and seeing that this is one of the most purchased ear buds on Amazon, I thought, &#34;Why not? I'll buy 'em&#34; &#8212; What a mistake!The sound from these ear buds are so flat without any bass whatsoever. I have a pair of cheapo plastic earbuds that aren't even &#34;in-ear&#34; and they sound like a pair of Sennheiser's compared to these. It literally sounds like I stuck a cotton ball in between my ear drum and the ear buds... that's how flat these are.

$review_text.: At full speed my copy of this fan had a very audible whine to it

 The blades themselves are designed well and the actual sound of moving air is pretty minimal, but the whine that it produced was very tonal and irritating

 I plugged it into my motherboard fan header and turned it way down to around 400rpm and it's quiet now, but most fans are quiet at 400rpm..
 Maybe I got a bad copy, but if you google around you'll find that I'm not the only one to complain of this whine
 Some suspect that early copies of this fan were better than the latest batches being produced

 I don't know, but a lot of people on forums are praising this fan as being some sort of miracle fan that makes no noise and has the power of a tempest so the prices are high while supplies are low
 If I had to do it again I wouldn't have overpaid for this fan when there are plenty of other good fans available at lower prices.

The key action is as good as keyboards costing much more.  I like the volume controls on board.  I do wish that it had adjustable feet for height adjustment.  But I do like the feet, becuase they have a rubber coating that really keeps the keyboard from sliding around.  For such a low price I really have no major complaints, and consider this an excellent buy from Amazon.

$REVIEW.: I was curious about this when I saw it on the Vine program

 I have several access points around my house and my office, and a rather complex network at home, so I'm always looking at other devices to help shape my network usage

 I like to keep my Airport Extreme tied into only my Macbook Pro that I use, and have another access point for devices and other computers so their network usage doesn't impact my large file operations.This arrived and I had some hopes for it


 Dual band is handy, and the fact that it has TWO PHYSICAL switches, one for power, and one to enable/disable the wireless radio only, really set this apart from almost all the others

 Nothing worse when you have to reset something not in a handy location is trying to one handedly hold the unit still while pulling the power cord out of the back of it, then pushing it back in to reboot if it hangs and isn't responsive to the web interface

 Much easier to just reach behind and push a plunger switch to cycle power.Got it unboxed, bypassed the mini CD that came with it since I use a Retina Macbook Pro that doesn't have a built in optical drive, so I just plugged into an ethernet port to get an IP address, then connect to it directly in the web interface to set it up.There's some good features in it's management pages, access control rules, the ability to set schedules for internet access if you have kids that you'd rather not have online after a certain time at night, etc..

 SPI and VPN passthrough settings for advanced users to configure if needed.My first complaint was during the "quick setup" I tested - one of the first things it tells people is that they should use the MAC address clone feature because, and I'm quoting the web page it displays during the process, it's "necessary for most users using a cable modem."  Now, I'm a CTO of a networking company, and I don't remember the last time I came across anywhere that had a MAC requirement - it's been at least 6 or 7 years, and the last one I've seen was Time Warner, since their old cable modems years ago used to memorize the MAC address of what was first connected, and would not allow any other unless you contacted support to have them clear that out of the non volatile memory (the memory that holds settings even after power is lost)
 Even they changed that a long time ago, and now you can simply turn off the cable modem for 10 seconds or so and power it back up again to clear out the old MAC it recognized before, without having to get with support at all


 And even THAT I haven't experienced in a long time, at home I've swapped out several firewalls and routers testing things and changing my configuration, never had an issue with a MAC address setting.For people with advanced needs and knowhow, there's an easy page for setting up inbound NAT translations for ports to devices inside the network, or you can simply designate a DMZ host outright.You can also pick how the dual band selection works - both 2.4 and 5GHz, or only one or the other


 There's a handy "help" on a column to the right with context sensitive information, for example here it lists what the advantages and disadvantages are for both, explaining congestion, penetration of solid objects limited in one or the other so the range is less, etc...The USB settings allow for network based sharing, so you can map drives and browse in Finder or Windows Explorer, or offer the drive up via FTP services
 You can also allow it to act as a media server


 You can create individual user accounts and allow read and read/write access, either allow FTP access or not
 However, the help section of the USB settings page shows instructions only for windows XP, or Windows Vista / 7 to access the share, but not for a Mac


 I was able to access with the normal Command+K then smb://192.168.1.1  (the default IP if you haven't changed it for the LAN IP) but it would have been nice for them to include the Mac user's method as well.The USB drive copy speeds aren't too bad, a 6.6 GB acronis true image TIB file took about 9 minutes to copy from the drive to my laptop.Another  positive was a quick reboot time, and firmware updates install quickly as well.However, this is where my rating dropped...The 5GHz band radio is NOT visible at ALL to my 2012 Retina Macbook Pro (which has N wireless built in)

 It's visible and usable to my iPhone, iPads, and iPod touches, but not to any of the Mac laptops I tried at all
 Even while this one doesn't work, the other N wireless networks I have around here are working fine and accessible to the Macs..

 Changing settings (about all you can change is channel width and channel) made no difference, so I couldn't have used this for myself if I wanted to
 Immediate fail right there, since Mac users aren't the majority, but there's certainly enough of us around that compatibility would be a huge issue


 I downloaded the most recent firmware update just in case that made a difference, and it doesn't


 I had a similar issue but reversed with another Cisco wireless router I tested, where everything worked with it except my iPhone 5 and my iPad 3
 I tested with all other devices powered off, so this was the only wireless network, no difference

 Even unplugged my cordless phones and took the batteries out of the handsets to make sure I didn't have anything else interfering (although even the dect 6 phones I have only operate at 1.9 GHz, not 5)
 Nothing I did made any difference, no matter what I tried, none of the three Mac laptops I tested with ever could see the 5GHz band although every other apple device could.I love the form factor and the shape, and as I already mentioned I really like that they have the nice simple plunger style power switch and having the ability to use a simple hardware switch to turn off the radios instead of having to get into the GUI based management to disable radios


 However, while I like the sleek design and the black finish, I'm not a fan of all the garish, flashing bright status lights on the front panel.So for me, it's a fail

 The one thing I use the most is my Macbook Pro, and this just wouldn't work with it


 I'll keep an eye out for any other firmware updates and edit my review here if I ever do get it working with the Mac computers.



$SUMMARY.: Oddly enough works for my IOS devices but not any Macbook Pro I've tried it with

$REVIEW.: I know wall mounts are all metal, but this one REALLY stands out.  I have it mounted in my living room above my couch, so I wanted a mount that was classy as well as sturdy, and I'm glad I chose this one.Pro's- Solid, thick steel construction, works with several size mounting styles, has dual adjustable tension, swings as smooth as glass with no sound, puts your monitor (or tv) in a myriad of different positions if so desired, has a cable track that routes cables so that it doesn't interfere with the movement of the arms, easy wall installation (easiest mount I've ever done, in fact), looks GREAT, includes a long T-handle key that allows easy adjustment even with the monitor in place, and includes all necessary hardware.  Even the instructions were easy to follow.Con's- 4 black plastic zip ties that were included were junk.  I broke all 4 just trying to use them- the little tooth in the square end of the tip tie broke on all 4.  It's the only flaw, and because it wasn't a flaw with the product itself, there's no reason to dock any stars.  Besides, I've got a canister of a bazillion zip ties that I got on sale somewhere and needed an excuse to use them!NOTE- Please understand this arm only tilts downward 5 degrees, but upward some 70 degrees.  I needed much more so I modified mine by bending the steel stops out of the way so I could get further downward tilt, and it worked great (can't take credit for this- I found the idea on the Egrotron forum and watched a youtube video, just keep in mind that you void the warranty, not that you'll need it).  It does take some muscle because, as I keep mentioning, it's steel.  I used a pair of channel locks to do make the modification.  Just google it. It doesn't ruin the mount or compromise it's safety in any way- You'd be hard pressed to break the also solid steel spring that gives it tension.You can't go wrong with Ergotron.  I was surprised by the weight of the arm, but I guess solid steel should have good heft to it.  Even my wife commented on the quality of it when she picked it up as I was installing the bracket on the wall.  The thumb screws to mount the monitor to the arm were a nice touch, but you can use the regular screws instead if you so choose.

The sound quality is pretty good, not great (duh, it's only $10).  Just because people give this high rating doesn't mean you should expect some great technology that will deliver everything.  It's good for the price.  When I lost these earbuds, I temporarily switched back to the stock earbuds.  I was SHOCKED, SHOCKED to find that the stock Sony MDR-E808 (which came with the Sony NW-E505) sounded better than these Sennheisers!  *Sigh* Now if only the stock earbuds weren't so short...

$review_text.: Like others, I never heard of AOC

 I was looking for the usual brands like Samsung, Toshiba, etc


and then happened upon this brand and model

 I figured this tv was only going to go into the bedroom so who cares if it is not up to standard?  Well was I surprised!  The picture on this tv is EXCELLENT!  I am not even using the HDMI connection as my hd cable box is hooked to my 40 inch tv via that connection

 I am using the component connection from my hd cable box and let me tell you I was amazed!  The component connection looks identical to what it would look like with hdmi


 The picture is crystal clear with beautiful color reproduction

 I did very little tweaking of the picture

 I can't comment on the sound as I am using the coaxial audio out from my cable box into my a/v receiver


 I can tell you that the viewing angle from below looking at the screen is where you may run into trouble


 The picture gets progressively dark so do NOT put the tv up too high if wall mounting it or attached to a stand on a desk or counter

 I purchased a vesa mount stand from 3M and it has some tilt forward which helps, but you really need to be just about eye level for viewing


 Other than that this tv is one major bargain and a quality item to enjoy!

$review_text.: I would strongly recommend against this unit.  They really don't work well, the required discs are flimsy, and replacing them (only available from Adonit, which charges $6 for 2 discs and $6 for shipping) makes them far too expensive.  The mini can't be used without the disc, and even with it they skip.  I quickly lost the disc that came with the pen.

$REVIEW.: Extremely easy assembly (1 screw), Has a fantastic picture, movies and games look wonderful. very fast 2ms response time so no blur in even the fastest on screen action. Colors are vibrant. Has several preset picture levels (Splendid, Brilliant, Games, Theater, Sports, etc...) plus every setting is user adjustable to get it just right for your tastes.Base tilts, but does not rotate. Doesn't matter though because base is round so whichever way you turn it, it looks the same anyways.Connections- has 1 VGA, 1 DVI, 1 Std HDMI, and 1 3.5mm headphone/speaker jack. Does not have speakers, but if you are running a HDMI video cable, and your video card has sound capability thru the HDMI, then you could plug speakers or headphones into it.

$review_text.: The Kingston Wi-Drive is an idea whose time has come.  It works well and makes viewing movies and other multimedia files via your iPhone/iPad very easy.However, there is one hidden drawback that makes the device far less desirable:  it is formatted in FAT32 and thus will not allow any file larger than 4gb to be copied over.  Let me repeat that so that it is very clear:  you cannot copy a file larger than 4gb to this device and there is no workaround for this limitation.  For those of you that are in the IT field, you understand what this limitation means.  For those of you not tech-savvy, what this means is that the largest size file that you can copy onto this device is about 4gb.  Now that may not sound like a big deal, but when you have a studio-produced movie file often the size of the file exceeds 4gb.  For home movies, song files and other basic multimedia files this is not a deal breaker.  But if you are using the device like I am, for watching Hollywood movies, then you will run headlong into this limitation.I contacted Kingston support to confirm that there is no workaround to this problem and they did confirm that this is a fixed limitation.  The drive cannot be reformatted to NTFS due to the configuration files for management of the wireless connectivity.  What really is frustrating is that Kingston chooses to hide this issue from the consumer.  No where is there any mention of this little restriction, and I believe that this type of fact should be clearly disclosed in the product description.Otherwise this is a great little device.  It's small, light, easy to work with, and the streaming of the files has so far worked flawlessly.  Unfortunately, the file size limitation severely reduces the number of production movies that you will be able to copy to the drive.[...]November 13th, 2011:Please click the COMMENTS link below to see a reply to my post and my subsequent reply to that post.  A suggestion to use a freeware application named Handbrake resulted in my ability to rip the original HD files over 4gb into reduced-size files optimized for my iPad.  Once I ripped (reformatted) the files, I ended up with a file that was less than half the size that I could move to my Wi-Drive.  There was no loss of quality and I now can watch all of my movies via the Wi-Drive.

$REVIEW.: I live in a distant suburb of the Denver area and the TV transmitters are at widely dispersed angles
 We lost a number of stations that we had been previously able to view prior to the transition to HDTV using our old beam roof-mounted antenna


 The install was straight-forward using my existing 75 ohm coax cable, replacing the beam antenna with the Winegard at the top of the mast and inserting the power splitter prior to my amplified splitter

 The new antenna allowed us to receive some additional stations, but also lost a few and several now come in, but sometimes drop out
 Though from the specs and the web tool, we appeared to be within range, that proved not to be the case


 However, the results are better than our previous antenna for HDTV

 I may end up trying to install separate bow-tie antennas with split orientation at some point, but for the moment it works

 This antenna would probably work much better if we were closer to Denver.

$REVIEW.: My husband's latest toy was the ipad2, which he bought himself for Christmas.  My computer background is strictly Windows based with either a desktop or laptop.  So immediately I was challenged because the ipad2 is touch only, plus Apple/app based.  Okay, sure there is a touch querty keyboard, but I'm just plain used to tangible keys for typing.  This keyboard is wonderful; it makes the conversion for usability for me for these reasons:1.  The keyboard operates very much like a desktop's, with keys of substantial size. The touch action is somewhat strong, but smooth.  I notice no particular differences in using this one from my desktop.2.  The screen and keyboard fit together easily and strongly and make for a good viewing angle.  It is very possible to balance the result on your lap so that you can surf and watch TV at the same time.  I know you can do this with a laptop, but using the ipad2 is less weight and not so cumbersome.3.  With the keyboard enhancement, I end up with full desktop capability and can use touch options as well if I choose; they both work at the same time.4.  The overall construction is, in a word, sturdy.  With normal use, I think that this keyboard will last me a long time.The current price of around $80 is better than the over $90 I paid about a month ago and well worth it for me.  With this keyboard, the only obstacles that remained were learning to use a new browser, Safari, and being without a mouse.  I am not too sure that my husband is happy that I can now use his ipad2.  This review will be updated if durability issues arise.

I bought a less expensive, very popular on Amazon brand, tried it, was amazed at how distored sound from an inferior speaker could be, and sent it right back.  Then I ordered these Polk speakers.  They are far better than the ones I returned and even better than the speakers that came with the PA.The sound is clear and full range.  There is no distortion.

$review_text.: I bought this for my parents since they were having trouble hearing the built-in speakers of their Samsung flat-screen.  I was particularly interested in the voice clarity setting.  One will definitely not mistake it for a surround sound system, but it has good volume and a wide stereo sound.  My parents seem to enjoy it. They have experienced a few "lock-ups".  I thought it might have been operator error until I managed to get it to lock up on me. The LED was lit as though the unit was on, but there was no sound. The power button on the remote nor the button on the unit would turn it off or fully on.  The only remedy is to pull the plug and then plug it back in.  Other than the few times this has happened, it seems to be a decent unit.

$REVIEW.: It really sells for $400 in the stores so right off the bat it was a great deal.  Of course if it didn't work it wouldn't matter, but it works flawlessly.  I work in the television industry so the setup was extremely easy for me.  I trust that anyone who considers themselves a videophile wouldn't have a problem, but this remote isn't for your Aunt Marge.  It is an advanced remote, meaning it is more sophisticated than your standard Universal remote.  That doesn't mean it's hard to setup and program though.  On the contrary it was so simple I couldn't believe it.  Anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of computers can program this through the remote's software interface.  I read some other reviewers had some trouble with the programming not working through the software, but with my Mac I didn't have any issues.  The RF signal makes this worth the money alone.  I have 7 components in a cabinet that all had separate remotes and required that I point the remote directly at each device.  Now, not only do I not have to point the remote anywhere in particular, but I can keep the cabinets closed, hiding all the unsightly hardware.  Best buy I've made for the money.

$REVIEW.: While this drive doesn't offer massive quantities of storage space when compared to others out on the market, security of your protected information just doesn't get any better than this!The external casing of this drive is solid metal, which I really like, as you'd have to work pretty hard to damage it accidentally
Unless it gets crushed somehow, nothing's gonna compromise the case on this drive! And, as far as accessing the drive's contents go, if you don't have one of the keys on-hand, that's just not happening

Fortunately, Toughtech provides plenty of keys for you to stash them as needed at work, at home, and in a purse or wallet

Without one of those keys, though, you're just out of luck - there's just no accessing the data on these drives without said key


When Toughtech claims government-quality security, they're not making a claim they don't deliver on!For your average person, the 500 GB of space on this drive should be more than enough for the most important of information that you'll want to make inaccessible to prying eyes, and the pricing on Toughtech's drives is more than fair for the security you're getting

The drive is also diminutive enough that you could easily slip it into a pocket, and take it with you.As for noise, I didn't find this drive to be exceptionally loud when data was being written to it

Granted, I do have some drives now that are completely silent when data is being written to them
While my Toughtech drive doesn't fit that bill, it's not loud enough to be troublesome to me.For this level of security, I think Toughtech offers up a drive that fits the bill across the board.

$review_text.: I've been using this player since before Christmas. It was a replacement for my XBox 360 HD add on I ended up selling (LONG STORY). I absolutely love this unit. The picture is outstanding and the sound is too. It upscales my DVD's fine and unlike some of the negative reviewers I've had no issues with lockups or connecting it to my network to download the firmware updates.The first movie I put in was Troy (Directors Cut) in HD and must say WOW. I never realized how blue Peter O'tooles eyes are until I watched him in Troy. Definately a good movie to show off the abilty of HD DVD. The water is so blue and the shots are so vivid. You would never know that most of the people in the movie are CGI (the scenes of the armys). Don'y even get me started on The Matrix Trilogy (also outstanding...the only 3 movies I have on DVD that I've decided to upgrade to HD DVD)Not sure why someone would give this player 1 star for scratched HD DVD's or their inabilty to connect it to a network for firmware downloads. (both personal issues...not issues with this player)I recommend this player to everyone. The only reason I wouldn't would be if you have a 1080p TV. Then I would recommend stepping it up to one of the 1080p Toshiba HD Players. If your TV is 720p then this is the player for you.

 I tried removing, adjusting and and finally was so frustrated I gave it to my son to play with and had him throw it in the trash

 With only one screen protector per box I'd suggest looking for another brand that offers at least 2 for this price.As a reviewer this has been one of the first products I've tested that has utterly failed in completing the task of covering an iPad


 The cheaper versions at Five Below offer 3 protectors per box and go on much easier with less bubbling

$review_text.: If you're planning to acquire one from a Best Buy grand closing near you (or the inevitable eBay scavengers) consider these medium-big caveats:1) The disk is unpredictably, autonomously spun down after 15-30 minutes idle, in Windows at any rate; not an internal drive setting, not triggered from the OS


The auxiliary USB ports will remain powered on--but you'll have to reset them anyway if you want to wake up the main drive.2) It seems not totally compatible with the new "Advanced Format" drives (4K sectors)


Chkdsk always warns on the second boot sector being unwriteable, even on a new drive

Depending on your drive brand and access pattern, that may be no issue


It *does* recognize a GPT partition, i.e
> 2 terabytes, but you'll have to reformat the disk after transposing into the enclosure.3) The MS/xD/SD/MMC slot won't read cards > 2GB, sorry (i.e


most every SDHC or SDXC card currently for sale).4) Don't keep a drive that runs hot in this enclosure; even with the aluminum body it's not going to dissipate enough heat under load.---It's too bad about the drive controller flaws, mostly a result of obsolescence, because the exterior design on this thing is great
The Rocketfish line usually gets the cosmetic & functional niceties right

Except for the annoyance of the power button being the same size as the useless "backup" button--it never fails that I press the one when I wanted the other--I wouldn't change anything

Well, maybe throw in a USB A-to-Powered-B cable longer than 3 feet, or an adapter to mount a 2.5" drive more easily
With the two powered USB 3.0 ports and integrated card reader on the front, it could work nicely as a docking station, if you bring your own display/audio/network adapters, of course.

The cable chase in the center could stand to be just a bit larger to allow all the cables needed in today's installations (in my case power was actually behind the TV so all power cables plus HDMI had to all go up to the power supply). Mounts easily and once equipment is on, it has a low profile. Simple and easy solution.
$SUMMARY.: Simple concept that works well

$review_text.: Plugged both cables into 2 USB ports and the drive worked right away.  Blu-ray discs are directly playable with S-Player.  S-Player is from China but has an English version.  KMPlayer should work, but I haven't tried it yet.  Both S-Player and KMPlayer are free.Drive noise is tolerable and not annoying at all all.  It is a uniform hissing sound like blowing winds.It takes about 12-14 minutes to rip a Blu-ray disc with MakeMKV.

$review_text.: These are great cables. I've ordered several inexpensive cables on amazon and other sites for years, and these "BlueRigger" cables are some of the best cables for the price you can find. Mediabridge makes a pretty good cable too, but I like the look, feel, and durability of these braided cables. They claim these cables are v1.4, I'm taking their word on these, being that I don't have any electronics that would require those specs, yet. But I would only get a cable that's too the 1.4 hdmi specs, so they're not useless on electronics I get in the future. For a couple more dollars, I think it's worth the investment.

$REVIEW.: I like the convenience of the Eye-Fi SD cards. They work fine but they are not known for quick data transfers.I understand there are many variables that dictate speeds of transfer. Their claims of 10x faster than the previous version is highly unlikely.I used this card on the 'ad hoc' mode in the class during a demo and the Canon T2i camera was not even 10 feet away from my MacBook Pro and it took forever to transfer the images.Even after I switched to JPEG from raw, this took an unacceptablly long time. I had the camera set to not power-off to ensure complete transfer and that didn't help.This card is convenient for folks who shoot and are in no hurry to work on their images on their computer. For my purposes, using it for demonstration, I'm afraid, it's was not a good choice. I already own the 8GB Pro version and I was hoping their claims of 10x faster transfer was true.Real world, using 'ad-hoc' transfer no.

$review_text.: This product fits the Nexus 7 very nicely. As some others have noted, it's almost like a case within a case. Envision your tablet enclosed in a front/back leather case, but then it attached to a "binder-like" secondary case via velcro. That's how this case works. The velcro is what makes it versatile to switch between portrait and landscape mode while standing up, along with a subtle elongated notch on the case to allow it to pivot into place. Personally, I find the portrait mode while standing up to be somewhat useless, as the velcro isn't any sort of heavy duty velcro to really hold the tablet up when in portrait mode. I do however really like the landscape mode, especially if you use an alternative launcher (such as Apex launcher) so the home screen can be landscape'd as well.My concern, truth be told, is the velcro. Since I have no interest in the portrait mode, and I have a slight concern with the velcro ultimately failing, I'll likely be finding a way to permanently attach the tablet case with the "binder-like" back case (fabric glue of some sort around the upper fold so it can still freely bend, yet be more permanent, perhaps?), that way I won't have to rely on the velcro. Of course, that'll limit me to landscape mode only when propped up, but that's my personal preference anyway.This case makes the tablet really thick, so if you're looking for something very thin, you might want to look elsewhere. However, the thickness around the tablet adds a sense of security, as I feel the tablet is far more likely to survive a hip-height drop than without. There's little doubt that this case is a good buy for the price, and I would easily buy it again. That said, as I mentioned earlier, I'll likely be brewing up some ways to permanently attach the two pieces together in the event the velcro begins to lessen its grip. I plan to take my tablet and this particular case with me when I go traveling this fall, as it's the best protecting case I have. Overall, still a very happy customer!
$SUMMARY.: Decent.

$REVIEW.: This is the first time I've built a computer and this is the graphics card I chose for the build. I chose the 7770 because I didn't want the worst or the best (well I wanted the best, I just can't afford the best) and this card seemed like a good in between. I haven't had any problems with it. I've only played a couple game so far and they are - Flight Simulator X and some Grand Theft Auto version which I don't remember. I'd say I have the settings cranked up on Flight Simulator and as I said before - no problems at all. I'm running an i7 3.5 ghz Intel processor and Windows 7.

$review_text.: I consider myself a mini keyboard expert and over the years have used keyboards by Adesso and Microsoft
 The Wedge Bluetooth keyboard, though very stylish and small, kept disconnecting from its Bluetooth connection and in frustration I just had to give it away to someone
 For a while I went back to an old Adesso min keyboard with trackpad but I longed for the separate mouse

 The Anker mini wireless slim keyboard at $29.99 seemed too cheap to be useful, but the reviews were excellent and so I tried it


 I am typing this review on the keyboard right now

 The keyboard is small and elegant, and slightly elevated at just the right distance from my desk
The keys have excellent feel and travel to them

 There are extra function keys for media control etc
 My only negative is that to conserve space the Page Up, Down Home and End functions are relegated to Fn + on the arrow keys
 However, this is a small price to pay and does not detract from my 5 star rating

 The radio dongle must be inserted into a USB port but it works very well on my wireless docking station
 The mouse also works perfectly


 It truly looks and feels like it costs at least 3x as much as it did


 The battery life has been excellent so far.I am a very aggressive typist and usually wear out the &#34;e&#34; and &#34;a&#34; keys quickly

 If I do on the Anker I will quickly purchase another one of the same


 It is that good.

$REVIEW.: I read a lot of reviews before selecting these little speakers and even though people wrote how great the sound was for their size, I was still skeptical. Well, the sound is just as good as described. It's clear and not tinny at all. My one complaint is that it's far too easy to accidentally turn the speakers on. The little 'on' bar sticks out so it can get pushed in with very little pressure. If the switch went back and forth as opposed to in and out as this one does, it would be much better. Overall, if you're looking for small size and quality sound, these are fantastic.

$REVIEW.: I purchased the DB4 as a replacement for a well-worn standard mast-top antenna (25 feet high). I live in the Tampa area suburbs, about 20-35 miles from the farthest network broadcast stations. The old antenna was a large one, about 5-6 feet long with about 20 elements, but with two missing, two bent, and lots of corrosion. I measured the signal strength using the old antenna for all the local digital channels. Then I installed the DB4. A few channels rose in strength slightly, but some prominent ones actually fell to zero. A lot of tweaking brought them up to barely usable strength, something that wasn't required of the old antenna. Now I understand that further tweaking and moving the location of the antenna might have improved the reception, but I was not in the mood for more work. I re-installed the old one and did some minimal adjustments and now have even better signal than before. I just wish I could return the DB4 without a lot of hassle. I cannot recommend the use of this antenna except in urban areas.

$REVIEW.: The Philips GoGear Cam is a slim, attractive, portable MP3 player with a host of great features
Unfortunately, some of these features leave something to be desired, putting the GoGear Cam behind other models in the Philips GoGear lineup.=BUILD=The look and feel of the GoGear Cam is one of its main strengths
 The brushed gunmetal top and slightly rubbery backing make the player easy to handle and attractive to the eye


 The build quality of the buttons is okay - they are generally easy to use and big enough not to accidentally hit two at once, but occasionally you may find a single press counting as a double press.=FEATURES=The GoGear Cam features a 2.0"LCD, AM/FM, 2MP camera, 8GB internal memory, MicroSD port, and supports a variety of sound, video and picture files


 It also comes with a cable connector for USB and composite output


 Oddly, .flac support is missing from the GoGear Cam, a feature you will find in the other GoGear models
 Also, lack of an hdmi port is a big disappointment.=QUALITY=The sound quality on the GoGear Cam is mostly limited by the headphones you use, as with most MP3 players

 I didn't notice any major difference between the GoGear Cam and other popular MP3 players for sound quality and the sound volume gets plenty loud


 Video playback is more mediocre with a 2" LCD that lacks vibrancy, seamless resolution and has a terrible viewing angle (so bad it affects even solo viewing)

 With only a tiny 2MP camera, many people will find their cell phones offer better still and video capture or at least comparable quality.=EASE OF USE=The GoGear Cam is mostly plug and play on the computer

 You plug in the device with the included to-USB cable and most computers will automatically recognize it as a Philips GoGear Cam
 Limited documentation is supplied in print, but a full manual can be found on the internal memory of device itself and can be accessed through exploring the folder contents via your computer
 Functions are organized intuitively and navigation of the device and folders is made easy.=CONCLUSION=The Philips GoGear Cam is a great, feature packed MP3 player that suffers from a few disappointing performance issues
 The GoGear Muse, Ariaz and Vibe may be better purchases, especially considering their price points comapred to the GoGear Cam and for those interesed in .flac or .ape support


 While none of them offer a built-in camera, this was not such an impressive feature and many people will not find the GoGear Cam's camera offering superior performance to a modern cell phone's built in camera.UPDATE:  Since using this mp3 player for audio books, I have run into two problems
 I have therefore reduced the rating from **** to ***

 The first problem is that tracks named using numbers will be ordered in reverse
 I have not found a remedy to this


 This means that if you are listening to tracks named "Chapter 01", "Chapter 02", etc

this mp3 player will play them in reverse

 It's quite annoying

 The other problem is that fast forwarding (or rewinding) work quite slowly, about 10x after it ramps up to top speed


 So if you accidentally skip to the beginning or end of a track, or lose your place for some other reason, it may take a few minutes to reach the point you left off from your audio book
 If you are not listening to audio books, these problems shouldn't matter much.

$REVIEW.: Over the years, I've done reviews and have studied prior to purchasing. I did no different on this LG 60PZ550. I looked at nearly all brands of PLASMA TVs and finally fell into the LG realm. My first thought was to get the biggest/best, then I started looking at the actual numbers. What was my criteria?1) Screen Size: 60" ... but, it had to be no more than 34" in height.2) 3D:  this isn't really my criteria, I inherited it from my kids.3) Thickness:  I don't want a very thick or heavy TV4) Plasma:  Sorry, I've owned and viewed LED/LCDs v. Plasma - for sheer 1080p experience, my perception is that Plasma always looks better.So, going through the brands, I found only LG to fit my criteria. The most important was #1, if it doesn't fit where I need it to fit, all the bells/whistles won't matter. I could give a hoot about 3D, but my kids insisted for their experience. We went to the big box stores and I will admit, it does look cool. I do not have the glasses yet, they are on their way (As the first reviewer mentioned, the 250's are for this TV). Thickness, holy smokes, who wants those behemoths we had a few years ago. This is thin and fairly lightweight. Beautifully done. OK, then finally, the Plasma v. LED/LCD debate. It will go on/on/on.. it's a matter of perception. Technically, the Plasmas have the edge; however, LED/LCDs are catching up. My personal perception is that Plasmas look MUCH better than LED/LCD. Your mileage may vary.If you do the great comparison that Amazon has towards the bottom of the product page, you'll see this TV is stacked up against the big 2 - PZ950 and PZ750 - whats missing from the 550? THX (yea right); TruBlack Filter (err, not sure what that is); SmartTV (more apps on the TV I'll never use because my 3D Bluray player has them); Magic Motion Remote (great, another remote that I have to point "just right" to do the menus ... plus, I already have a remote that turns it on and off) ... hmm ... not really seeing why I would pay a premium for those features. All else is equal.So, yes, would I recommend? **ABSOLUTELY** What don't I like about it? Nothing, I love it; however, something that might irritate people is the very reflective surface. It's like a mirror; however, properly positioned (I have a tilt mount), it eliminates my the irritant factor. I've had it with lights on and off and it's beautiful. Really, I am not using this TV to it's true potential with all the stuff on it. I don't use sound (it's connected to an HDMI receiver), I don't tune with it (U-Verse customer), I have 2 cables going to it:  power and HDMI (high speed recommended ... or ... incorrectly labeled HDMI 1.4a). I don't even use the internet portion. I use it as a HUGE monitor for all the stuff I do (U-Verse, Wii, PS3, Bluray) ... and now 3D.UPDATE 13APR2011 - This TV most certainly has ARC (Audio Return Channel). "Definition: Audio Return Channel (ARC) ia a very practical feature that has been introduced in HDMI ver1.4. What this function allows, if both a home theater receiver and a TV have HDMI ver1.4 and offer this feature, is that you can transfer audio from the TV back to a home theater receiver and listen to your TV's audio through your home theater audio system instead of the TV's speakers without having to connect a second cable between the TV and home theater system."The 60PZ550 is certainly doing this function through my receiver. I made the assumption that since I did not connect my internet to it, I wouldn't need it. I connected my TV to the internet today to see what the functions were ... typical ... Netflix, Hula, Youtube... etc. I fired up a Netflix movie (which looked pretty decent) and low and behold, I have BEAUTIFUL sound coming out of my receiver.  Please DISREGARD the reviewer who stated there was NO ARC.

$review_text.: What is a Digital/Graphics/Pen Tablet?It's a device that allows  you to draw or write directly to the computer screen & provides pressure sensitivity which is not usually available when using a mouse.I installed the H420 on my ASUS laptop, OS Windows 7 and didn't have any problems with installation.The H420 has a textured work surface which gives it some grip  similar to writing on paper. The  digital pen is comfortable to hold & comes with 4 extra nibs (pen tips) & a clip  tool which is used to grab the nib. I haven't found the pen holder that is mentioned in the instructions.  The pen works similar to a mouse; its 2 buttons also work like the buttons on a mouse & can re-programmed & assigned other traditional mouse  commands.This graphic tablet worked perfectly with Microsoft Word 2010, Microsoft Paint & Serif DrawPlus Starter Edition. The digital pen is pressure sensitive if the program you're using supports that feature.  The tablet has 3 Express buttons which can be programmed to your needs. Currently the buttons are set for Copy, Paste & Enter. The H420 comes with a Tablet PC Input Panel program that pops up on your tablet/PC screen so you can write directly on your computer.  If you're not familiar with this, click on 'Tools' --> 'Help topics' when the panel pops up on your computer screen to learn how this feature works.I inserted this sentence into my review, writing freehand style,  using the input panel.There are several YouTube videos showing artists demonstrating how to use a graphic tablet.Digital pen requires AAA battery which is not included.The tablet is performing as described.review sample provided

We have cables everywhere in our house, so one less is a treat.I also love that the cables for charging the devices all included and are fitted into the housing, which makes packing this for the road simple
The cords are always neatly folded away, giving the unit a clean look, ensuring all the cables are always available, and there is no tangling with other items that are packed in the purse/bag.The battery can charge Apple devices except for iPhone 5 and the most recent iPad (Apple now has a smaller connector) as well as most Android phones (micro-USB and USB).The only knock I have on the device is the size, which is a necessary evil of getting 6000mAh


If you only need to carry a single phone charge with you, look at the lower capacity batteries

We charge multiple phones with this, and like the fact that we don't have to recharge the battery every time it is used to charge a device.

$review_text.: The Case Logic iPad 101 Apple iPad Sleeve is great for putting your iPad in to carry it around, especially if you are going to place it in a bag with other items


The sleeve will keep your iPad protected from scratches and bumps while in the case


The case unzips along the top and and most of the way down one side so it is easy to slip your iPad inside of it

There seems to be ample padding inside to protect the iPad in case of accidental dropping

The case isn't too bulky so it won't take up much space
One thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars is that I don't care for the feel of the material on the outside of the case

It has a cheap fake feel to it

Also, if you are going to be traveling with your iPad and need to bring along the charger, there are no other pockets or storage spaces on this case to be able to put it in
This would be a case you would use to carry the iPad around every day or to store it in when not in use
I actually like the Case Logic Netbook carry case better for the iPad as it has the zipper compartment for the iPad to fit in that is padded, but also has an outside zippered compartment for the charger and stylus (if you so choose to have one) to go.

$review_text.: this is an Apple keyboard clone for sure.  but it stands in its own right because of how functional and stylish it is.  My one complaint is the build construction.  it is made of plastic.  cheap plastic if i had to guess.  when i hit the space bar, there is a noticeable bend in the entire keyboard.but the keys are satisfying to press, it looks great on the desk, it connects and works instantly/flawlessly, its a good keyboard.  i just hope i can geta year out of it :/

$REVIEW.: This notebook sleeve for the Macbook Pro 15" seems to be a very good fit
 There is very little wiggle room when loaded
 It also seems to be of good construction


 My only complaint is the color

 I wish I had been given choices instead of black
 At any rate, the main idea is to protect the Macbook, which it appears to be very capable of doing

 I like the side pouch for carrying smaller items such as a flash drive, which has a smaller pouch included inside.I looked for quite a while and tried some other sleeves, but this one seems to be the only one that will work for me

 In addition, the price is very reasonable.

$review_text.: I have owned this camera for 3 years now. I have used it wherever I have went to capture pictures. Although it is not as sharp and clear as an SLR, it does everything I've wanted it to with exceptional quality. When taking pictures, I notice that it gives lifelike pictures, with quality to spare upon zooming.The only downside thus far is it's ability to shoot in lowlight situations, namely twilight hours. It doesn't capture its best when under a dark influenced environment, so that's why I am knocking off a star.It has many capabilities, such as simple mode, close-up mode, scenic mode, and movie mode (ability to capture video), to name a few. I would consider myself an amateur with regards to photography, and this camera has been easy for me to handle and adjust while shooting abroad. I have come up with some decent pictures when I was not expecting too.On a side note, the battery lasts a good while on one charge, 5 hours, and the camera is very sturdy and has not fell apart as of 3 years (knock on wood). So if you ever find yourself contemplating this camera, I would say you would be in good hands.

$review_text.: As far as IPad covers go, this one is pretty affordable. The only downside is this is very thin and pops off of the corners quite often and it's a huge hassle to stretch it out to get it back on. The color works well with the Smart Cover, but is not a perfect match. Also the corners are so tight the screen protector keeps coming loose. I might buy another one if it was on sale for less than $10

$review_text.: After using this mouse for 2 to 3 years, my index finger has been ruined.  Usually I read stuff like that on Amazon and roll my eyes, you're forgiven if you did the same.  Allow me to explain....The scroll wheel on this is made of a material that tugs at my skin and feels significantly harder to scroll than other mouses I've tried in recent history.  I use this at work and went away from it for a while to the default mouse that came with my work computer (Lenovo) and while the scroll wheel was much, much smoother and easier to scroll, it was a small wheel which more or less cut into my index finger which was already sensitive from using the MS Natural Mouse.  The other issue with the scroll wheel on this mouse (other than the material) is that it has grooves in it instead of a smooth service.  Now, I do have sensitive skin (which I am surprised extended to my finger) so I could very well be one of the few people that have this issue.Other than that, the mouse is perfectly responsive, I've never had an lag issue.  It's a very, very comfortable mouse as it puts your hand in a more natural position than standard mice.Sadly, the scroll wheel has pushed me to another mouse and I've just ordered my second trackball (Kensington Expert) because I loved the first trackball (old Kensington Orbit) except for the fact it was mechanical and no matter how much I cleaned it, it stuck too often.  Sadly, at the time I'm writing this, it looks like MS has stopped making this design.  I'd love to see it with an updated smoother scroll wheel minus any grooves, but that won't be happening anytime soon.
$SUMMARY.: Great hand position, terrible scroll wheel.

We were camping in the desert and got radio stations over 100 miles away. Used it to charge a phone, although no radio listening when your doing that, and drains the power dramatically when you do. Fortunately, all you have to do is crank it up and you are listening to the radio again. Very nice addition to our camping gear.

$review_text.: The suction cup window mount for my Garmin broke, so I thought I would try this friction mount.  It has a nice size, and is easy to set up.  I started driving, and was impressed with how stable it was on the surface roads.  However, then I got on the freeway, and the stability went out the window.  With the window mount, the GPS didn't shake, and stayed put.  I had driven over 8 hours without an issue.  Unfortunately, I learned that the dash shakes a lot more than the window.  I had trouble following the GPS while on the freeway, because it bounced around quite a bit from the vibrations in the dash.  The friction mount didn't do much to dampen the vibrations.  Also the friction mount slowly drifted across the dashboard as I drove no more than a few minutes on the freeway.  So I am back to Amazon to buy a new suction mount for the window.  I don't recommend this friction mount if you do a lot of freeway driving.

$review_text.: The quality of these headphones is undisputed. I absolutely ADORED these headphones.But after 2 weeks of use, I dropped my Kindle and bent the 3MM plug. And the ONLY recourse JVC gave me was "buy a new set".When I wrote to them, asking for the address of a repair facility, stating that I was willing to pay for repair and return shipping, JVC's response was "Physical damage automatically voids the warranty", and I clearly voided my warranty by damaging them! I had not asked for warranty replacement ... I asked for a repair facility, stating my willingness to PAY for repair.Two weeks of intermittent use and they want me throw them away and buy NEW headphones.This lack of customer service by JVC has told me that I should seek another manufacturer for replacement. This is, to my eye, totally reprehensible.I once wore out a pair of Koss headphones, !past! the warranty point, and Koss simply replaced them for free, despite my willingness to pay for their repair. THAT is customer service. I should have stayed with Koss!My recommendation is that anyone looking to buy ANYTHING electronic, do a little research into a manufacturers customer service policy.I, personally, will NEVER purchase ANYTHING from JVC again.Not at ANY price.

$review_text.: I cannot speak for Intel-based Macs, but these CD-Rs have given me problems on all my PowerPC based machines
My (beige w/ external burner) G3 refused to write them at all

My G4 (Quicksilver) did write them, but several times when I went to retrieve data from a Memorex CD-R, it was damaged

My G5 handles them fine, but the drive makes a horrid scratching noise that it doesn't with, for example, Maxell CD-Rs
Also, I was burning them in Joliet format for use on a PC, which may make a difference.When I called Memorex about my original issue, they told me my drive (the G3 external) didn't 'like' their CD-Rs, and that was that

Tough for me, eh? I will say they seem to work fine in PCs, and it may be some problem with Pioneer burners (both the G4 and G5 have these)

All the same, I'd get a smaller package before I hauled off and bought a hundred of these if I owned a Mac, and especially a PowerPC based one.

$review_text.: I really want to like these.  I really do.  And I think that depending on your expected usage, these may or may not work for you.Right out of the box, the packaging is nice.  Instructions were easy enough to figure out.  All that is required is to plug them in to charge for a few hours, pair and go.  I was able to get these paired to my Nexus 5 in seconds.  Easy thus far.I should also not that the way that these turn on and off is by magnets.  The ear pieces have magnets in them.  When stuck together, the headset is off.  Pull them apart, and the headset wakes up.  This worked well in my office and not so well when I took them traveling.  I had them in a compartment in my backpack where they were jostled and separated.  So just be aware.However, then I got to wearing these and things got a little weird.  The headset does not contain an over-the-ear hook.  They do provide some stretchy rubber band type of things that go over the headset and help you jam them in your ears.  I had one false start but was able to get them into my ears just fine.  To me, I just never got 100% comfortable with the fit.  They were fine but I believe that I prefer over the ear style headphones than in the ear.  That's just me however.The sound to me was not as good as I expected from other headphones.  Other reviewers might have had different experiences but to me, the sounds was metallic sounding or hollow.  Maybe it was my music but that's what I heard.When I was wearing the headphones around the town and in the airport, I could still get enough ambient sound to tell what was around me.  Often a very good thing when in the airport or traveling.Call quality was ok by me.  I don't really use these for phone calls.Long and short, they're ok for music.  They're ok on the fit.  They're just ok.

$review_text.: It is unfortunate that there is not an option of a rating of "zero stars".This is very likely the worst piece of gear that I can remember ever buying. I did not get around to starting to program the Harmony unit until about one week ago. Well it still isn't programmed primarily because the unit cannot hold a charge long enough and the software does nothing but tell me that it cannot get an internet connection.Besides these major points I think this 890 is truly a piece of junk. This is due to many things not the least of which in my case are:The programming problems,The failure to hold a charge,The build quality is incredibly poor,The buttons are too small and very unresponsive,Despite Logitech's promises to the contrary this unit does not work with my lighting system (I checked with them before buying),It does not work with my DVDO unit which is an important unit in my setup,You need great eyesight to even hope to read the functions on the buttons,I don't have enough years left to live to sit on hold with the ironically named Logitech Customer Care people (only to be told the same thing I can read off the internet) or the days and days it takes them to respond to an email.If I cannot get a credit on this from dealer I will literally throw it in the garbage.

Memory upgrades either work or they don't - when your computer speeds up and doesn't develop new issues, I consider it a success.  I added this to an aging Dell Optiplex 330 and it has been running for several months without problems.After several weeks of successful performance, I upgraded a second computer (identical to first) and the RAM failed upon installation.  I spent a few hours making sure the problem was with the memory and not something else I forgot to do (like BIOS update, poorly seated DIMM, etc).

 If you receive an adapter that doesn't work, from my experience I'd say that they will replace it with a working product immediately.This adapter cost $5; the equivalent Apple adapter costs $30


 The Apple adapter, in addition, doesn't fit many DVI cables snuggly

 This one fits perfectly

$review_text.: The TP-Link TL-MR3020 is the third travel router I have used in the past year or so. I bought both theD-Link All-in-One Mobile Companion (DIR-505)and theD-Link SharePort Go Mobile Companion with Rechargeable Battery (DIR-506L). The TL-MR3020 is closer in function to the DIR-505 in that it requires external power. Both have a multiposition switch to select among various modes, both can let you create your own WiFi hotspot relaying a connection from another hotspot (such as at a hotel), both will convert an Ethernet drop to a WiFi hotspot. The DIR-505 has a built-in AC plug while the TL-MR3020 uses a USB power connection with a provided generic USB power supply. I was intrigued to note that the power cable TP-Link supplies is a "Y" style with two USB "B" plugs. This is usually seen for devices that may need more power than a single USB jack can provide.A feature the TL-MR3020 has that the DIR-505 does not is the ability to connect one of a select set of USB 3G/4G cellular modems and convert that into WiFi access. I was not able to test this mode - if this interests you, be sure to see if your modem is listed as compatible. On the other hand, the DIR-505 lets you connect a USB storage device and access media and files on that device from connected devices. This is something I have more need for, and I'm sorry to see it missing. More on this later.I like that TP-Link preconfigures the TL-MR3020 with WPA security and a unique password for the wireless - the default SSID and password is printed on a sticker. You can, once you log in, change it to whatever you want. You do have to know that you need to connect to 192.168.0.254, which is a bit unusual. The router administration interface is very detailed and has most of the features you'd expect in a midline router, though no "guest mode". The TL-MR3020 does support WiFi Protected Setup (WPS) and offers a pushbutton on the router to activate it.TP-Link recommends that you use the "Quick Setup" item in the router menu to configure the router for your environment. But I could not get this to work - one page asks you about cloning the MAC address of the connected computer - something that is of use in a router you're using at home, not for a travel router. But no matter what I picked here, as soon as I clicked Next, the wireless connection dropped. I tried this many times and with many combinations. You don't need this - just go to the Wireless tab and click Survey if you want to connect to another wireless connection (such as at a hotel) - this works. D-Link's "Setup Wizard" also fails to work, so it's a failure of both brands here. So just skip the Quick Setup and go to the Wireless tab.You will read a lot of reviews here about how wonderful it is to be able to install OpenWRT, a free, open-source software package, on the TL-MR3020. Yes, it is wonderful, and doing so would add the media server I want. I will be doing this, but I thought it would be better to review the product as the manufacturer ships it as many of you may not have the desire or the skills to install and configure OpenWRT.In operation, the TL-MR3020 worked fine. The WiFi signal was strong at any reasonable distance and I had no issues with performance. It is only a 2.4GHz router, though - no 5GHz available.If you are considering the TL-MR3020, also look at theTP-Link Portable Battery Powered 3G/3.75G Wireless N Router (TL-MR3040). This is very similar to the TL-MR3020 in router features, except that it doesn't come preconfigured as secure, doesn't support WPS and lacks a physical mode switch. The TL-MR3040 can run from battery or from a USB power supply. If I had to choose I'd take the TL-MR3040 for its battery capability - like the TL-MR3020 it can also run OpenWRT.And what about the competing D-Link products I mentioned above? While both work, I am disappointed that D-Link releases new hardware with minor improvements shortly after releasing the original model, and doesn't fix problems in the firmware. TP-Link seems more consumer-friendly to me, and the option of OpenWRT (not available for these D-Link models) means additional freedom.

$review_text.: Why would Jeep/Chrysler use two different (but very similar) connectors for the front and rear speakers??? I guess that's why all the confusion about whether it fits or doesn't in the reviews. I have the 7-speaker factory option, not sure if that matters with the connectors. I ended up just clipping off the connectors and soldering the wires, instead of waiting for another connector that fits. I am impatient I guess.

$review_text.: While this is not nearly as fast or as crisp (screen wise) as the Nexus 7 - it is a fabulous deal for the price. There are two things that make it for me 1) The keyboard, which is perfect for middle/high school work that my children do and 2) the MicroSD slot which expands the tiny 8GB that is on board to something that allows local movie and music storage. The deal is so good I'm picking up another one as a Christmas gift!

$review_text.: The Nano 6th Gen has a flat bottom to it and this plug fits almost flush to the screen side , but it extends too far out on the backside where the clip is at. This means the plug is certain to be popped off if it is not cut back about 1/32 of an inch. A razor blade can do the trimming needed.The iPod Classic has a curved edge where the slot opening tapers to the back of the player. This means the plug does not fit flush with the backside and gives an 'edge' where the plug is more likely to be leveraged off. My hard case for the Classic extends past the iPods body enough that this is not a problem. If you are not using a hard case the plug will most likely fall out if bumped.I suggest the Gigaware Silicone Dock Connector Cover as a better option as it slightly smaller and has a more secure fit.

$REVIEW.: It is a nice MB with a ton of features:Pros: built in bluetooth, 3 PCIex16 slots, angled sata connectors, a power button right on the board, plenty of USB ports and as many headers on the board to connect more USB ports, many hardware switches, switchable graphics, comprehensive management suite to control OC, and monitor sensors.Cons:- the bluetooth seems to be a class 3 - that is more than a few feet away and you lose all connectivity with your BT device, and you probably could connect a keyboard or a mouse (don't have any of these), but I know for certain that connecting BT headphones was a fiasco - after I installed the BT dongle drivers it did recognize the headphones and even allowed me to select it as the default output device, but the sound had very high latency and was terrible (I use the same headphones with my laptop and it works great). So unless you actually plan to use it for OC monitoring (like it was intended to) - it is pretty much useless.- USB ports don't stop supplying power when the computer is off and there is no setting to control this, hence had a few harddrives that would keep spinning even after the computer was powered down...- Switchable graphics - that is an awesome feature, I guess... I didn't have a power meter at the time to see if running my PC of the internal GPU while having a discrete GPU plugged in made sense, but since it only works with older GPUs and I don't have my 8800GTX anymore - there is no way for me check it anymore. And yeah, it is a con, because for me that was one of the features that I bought this MB for, but since I put in GTX670 the &#34;switchable&#34; part of the graphics broke (games that were set to switch to the discrete GPU would hang, crash do things that could not be classified as working) and having things the other way around made no sense since encoding on my GTX660 or even on the PCU itself was faster than trying to encode stuff using the built in GPU (GMA, and yes I did find a transcoder specifically supporting intel quickvideo encoding). So ended up just using my GTX670 all the time without the &#34;switchable&#34; thing as it didn't work anyway. (btw in my case the difference for idle is about 20W - the GTX670 when idle draws 20W more than the GMA)- management suite - the Windows 8 version does not do anything, firmware updating kinda works, but that is about it.So in the end, even though I bought it because of its comprehensive suite of tools and features in the end most of them turned out to be pretty much useless since they were not implemented properly, or simply since my plans somewhat changed (I was planing to buy a second GTX670 when they became cheap and I would not have enough performance for modern games - at the current pace I still have plenty of time before I run out of performance even with a single GTX670, they probably might release GTX970 by the time I start running out of performance for gaming :( )Other thoughts:- angled sata connectors turned out to be a nightmare in my case with the harddrive bay also being angled and less than an inch of space between the connectors on the MB and the wall of the harddrive bay, but that was a poor choice of a case and MB on my side, there are cases that do have an angled harddrive bay and also lack the wall around where the sata connectors are so it should not be a problem.- it does cost money to send the MB back to ASUS, they do try to repair your MB, but apparently don't test it after they are done - after 2 years of good work it stopped booting one day (it would power up the fans, but nothing more than that not even a beep). So 1st attempt (after of 2 days of dancing on the phone: &#34;did you try rebooting your computer? are you sure you did?&#34;)  - it boots, but occasionally shuts down, and somehow it now lacks a thermal sensor?! 2nd attempt - it almost does not shutdown anymore, the sensor is still missing so I keep getting on each boot a warning that my MB temperature is -128C (-198.4F)...I am not going for another ASUS product anymore - there are other better options, which hopefully have better customer support. But customer support aside the product does perform satisfactory most of the time, so it does deserve at least 3 stars.

$REVIEW.: As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book "Take Me To A Circus Tent" and a former radio disc-jockey, I am often asked to write and or discuss various audio products and recordings from the 60's and 70's.Sennheiser PX 100W Mini HeadphonesAs far back as my first announcing job, I selected Sennheiser for a myriad of reasons.There used to be a term called "Listener Fatigue" with standard closed (heavy) headphones because it is very unnatural for the ear to support weight for a period of time.  Not only with many inferior headphones would the inner ear hurt from the music but also the weight would cause additional discomfort on the outer portion.Sennheiser designs headphones to offer freedom of "Listener Fatigue" and for the consumer to encompass the entire musical spectrum.If your forte is rock, jazz, or folk the headphones will create a natural rich environment for the ears to cherish.Sennheiser has always priced their products to be consumer friendly.  It is not uncommon for a competitor to charge as much as double for a lesser quality headphone.Enjoy the music and be well,Craig FentonAuthor of the Jefferson Airplane book "Take Me To A Circus Tent"

$REVIEW.: I first saw the set XVT553SV at Sams (for $150 less than Amazon) I started researching. I read many great reviews here, at Sams.com, cnet.com, and a couple of others. I also read ALL the bad reviews & considered everything carefully. I got it from Sams, and quickly ran into a setup issue. The setup wizard asked what my cable source is: cable box or straight from wall. Mine is from a box, via coax, so I said box. Then it wanted me to specify the input, but the coax/rf input wasn't an option. I tried everything I could think of, then turned it off & waited for regular business hours to call Vizio. A friendly guy named Harley (speaking standard American English) walked me through the setup and all was well. The procedure, by the way, was complex enough I already forgot the steps! Minor issue, good support, satisfactory outcome.The next issue a week later was setting up a new Sony AV receiver, STRDH820. I picked this in part because it has ACR (audio channel return) meaning the TV can send audio back along the HDMI cable & you can use the receiver to get surround sound for the TV with only the HDMI cable. I am doing my best to eliminate as many wires as possible. I even ordered all new HDMIv1.4 cables that support Ethernet, 3D, and audio return. I wanted to make sure the cables are interchangeable in case I swap the cables around. I CHECKED ON VIZIO.COM TO MAKE SURE THE TV WILL SUPPORT ARC. It says ARC is supported on HDMI 1 only, you can verify this at "[..] plus I saw it in at least one review.I spent a very long time trying to make this work, but finally called Vizio. They said no way, this TV doesn't output anything from the HDMI port, it's for incoming traffic only. (the reference to ARC on their website is a mistake, or so they say) They said use the RCA stereo out or Toslink optical to send the signal to the receiver. Back to Wally World to spend another $19 for fiber optic cable. I hooked it up, the AV receiver now runs the TV sound through the surround sound speakers. Guess what - the overall sound isn't as satisfying as the fake surround the TV creates through its own speakers, at least for the one sitcom I tried it on. I'll try tweaking things through the receiver when I have time. Moderate issue, OK support, marginally satisfactory outcome.Overall, the TV is great. the picture is beautiful. I still haven't tried it out with the Wii, I tested the Internet Apps and can't see any reason to get excited, but movies are great & TV is mostly great. ABC is on channel 3, the channel my cable box tunes through, and has some odd horizontal banding, but I'm 99% sure this is a cable system issue. Charter has always had goofy sound issues on FOX, and I think this is their fault also. It's so minor I don't know if it's worth the time to try & fix it.UPDATE - next afternoonAfter posting, I finished reading every single review here, and someone mentioned the Audio Return Channel issue, but said she solved it by adjusting the CEC settings. I looked at Vizios' info some more, and at other online resources, but saw nothing about it, so I entered the Vizio "MENU", then "TV Settings". The bottom choice is "CEC". Then I set "CEC Function" to "ON" and "System Audio Control" to "ON". The last item here was "Device Discover". When I entered this item the TV found my Sony AV receiver and Blu-Ray player, even though they were off. I turned the receiver on, then went through to the back of the TV & unplugged the Toslink optical cord, and in the menu I turned OFF the TV speakers. The sound is now coming through my surround sound system WITHOUT a separate audio channel, just like audio return is supposed to work. Mind you, Vizio swore this won't work with this TV, but what the heck.Too bad I already bought the optical cable. I'll put it in a box with my multiple RCA audio & video cables and my digital coax, and a couple hundred bucks worth of other adapters I bought when they seemed really important.

But there have been too many frustrations in just getting it up and running to really enjoy it.As many others have pointed out, installation takes HOURS, a process that data mines every media file on your computer (with no way to opt out). I work in the news media and have literally thousands and thousands of media files on my computer and no, I do not need to get bogged down in every file I ever processed each time I want to create something new. The learning curve is steep on this - the user interface is not particularly intuitive or user friendly.And as others have noted, be sure to check that your computer meets the minimum system requirements or your experience will prove even more frustrating. I'll keep at this for another month or so and update if something changes but as of now, this is too frustrating for all but the most die hard video editors.

$REVIEW.: I have a rather large head and wear glasses.  This makes finding comfortable headphones difficult.  While I don't mind earbuds, it seems that most of the decent sounding ones are designed to fit snugly into the ear canal which I also find uncomfortable (plus they get nasty with earwax).  I really like how the Bose phones feel and they work great for noise canceling, but the inner audiophile in me cannot stomach (or afford) to spend $300 on them.  Enter the Sony MDR-NC40 which I purchased refurbished here on Amazon via a third-party.  I am satisfied for the price I paid.  They offer decent (but not great) noise canceling.  They sound ok (for the money) and most importantly they are comfortable.  I've found that "on-ear" headphones work best for me.  While they do put pressure on my ears, at least they are well padded and don't interfere with my glasses.  Over the ear headphones put pressure on my glasses and make my head feel like it's in a clamp.  I can wear the NC40 for a couple of hours straight before needing to take a break from them.The biggest con for these headphones is that they sound terrible when the noise cancellation is turned off.  On the other hand, with noise cancellation turned on they tend to sound kind of muddy and bass heavy.  The sound overall, with noise canceling activated, is rich and makes lossy digital sound almost like analog.  There's even a little bit of hiss from the noise cancellation that might trick you into thinking that it's 1986 again and you're listening to a cassette tape on your Sony Walkman.  Overall, I recommend them.

$review_text.: Bought a couple of these for portable, cool, daylight balanced video use for business videos and as part of a very portable field video "studio."  Excellent light output


 Will likely purchase several more to increase the breadth of the lit area

 Get extra rechargables for these


 They are remarkably bright, and also dim down if needed

 These also make great, if short lived, very bright emergency lighting

 Come with ball mounts with 1/4 by 20 thread for mounting on light stands, or on clamps drilled to accept this very standard bolt size
 The filters and diffusers are also very good
 The diffuser really does a nice job softening the light for faces
 You can substitute AAA batteries, rechargable or alkaline

in a pinch

 I am considering making a contact block to fit the battery clips so I can use a transformer or an over sized battery pack that will last a whole shooting day.

$REVIEW.: I like WordPerfect Office and I believe it to be a better office suite than MS Office. The three major components of this suite &#8211; WordPerfect, QuattroPro and Presentations &#8211; offer the same main features that are represented by MS Office&#8217;s applications, at a smaller cost. My main complaint about WordPerfect Office has been compatibility with MS Office and with version X7 Corel has taken the suite a good step in the right direction. It&#8217;s still not perfect but it&#8217;s noticeably better than was available in version X6.The centerpiece of the application suite is WordPerfect itself, a solid, fast and very stable word processor that at one time ruled the world of text processing. Every iteration of WordPerfect has been an improvement over what Corel offered in the previous version and this version is no different. While the user interface is basically the same, Corel seems to have concentrated on speed and compatibilIty updates. WordPerfect launches faster (at least it does on my system) and it is at a ready state faster too. But, most importantly, it has an easier time importing and exporting MS Office-compatible document files. The transformation is not perfect &#8211; it still frequently messes up the formatting just a little &#8211; but overall the import of .docx files works fairly well and does not require a huge amount of fiddling to get things right.I have had limited success with editing PDF files (to be fair, I have not tried to do this much so my sample set is very small) but the export of documents to PDF is about as close to pristine as one could ask. When I have used WordPerfect to create new PDFs the final document has looked right every time, and so far I have not had to do anything other than export. If I could change one thing &#8211; the resulting PDFs seem to be larger than necessary. When I have done the same in other word processors, the files are almost always smaller. This is more of an observation than a complaint.I used to use the QuattroPro spreadsheet quite a bit. Due to stability issues in the past I migrated to another Excel-compatible spreadsheet but that was a while ago. From what I can tell, QuattroPro is a lot more stable than it was when I last used it in depth (version X4) so I will take a closer look at it later when I have more time. It is quite usable, though, and it is user-friendly.The weak link in the suite is Presentations. As in version X6, it does a poor job of importing and exporting .ppt and .pptx files, usually screwing up the formatting and transitions in grand style but at least retaining the data. I made a fairly simplistic .ppt file and imported it into Presentations and the result was text that was the same color as the background and in the wrong font (and resized). When I fixed my file and re-exported to .ppt format, it looked wrong on the other side too. I never could get it to look exactly right in both applications. If you really don&#8217;t need PowerPoint compatibility, Presentations does a nice job all on its own and one can use it to create very nice presentations.WordPerfect Office is a nice alternative to MS Office. The applications are fast, powerful and have some compatibility with their MS Office equivalents. Corel has put some effort into improving the compatibility and it shows, though there is still room for improvement. If you want an office suite that is better than MS Office and you can put up with a few relatively minor compatibility issues, WordPerfect Office X7 is a nice choice.

$REVIEW.: I bought the BlackVue camera after sorta returning a very popular $70 eBay bought Chinese camera

I say sorta as I never got my money back for the cheap camera.The biggest reason I bought the BlackView was that is uses a super-capacitor for backup power, instead of a Lithium Ion Battery
I live in Texas, where this summer is has been in the triple digits nearly every day
I do NOT want to put a no-name fire hazard into my car and leave it to cook every day


I know that reviews of earlier versions of the BlackVue cameras complained of overheating


So far mine has survived 4000 mile road trip to Grand Canyon and back (in June), a couple 115 degree days in Phoenix, and every day in 100+ degree Texas every day since


It has not missed a beat and no failures or drop in image quality.The features and compact size were the other things that sold me
The viewing angle is so wide it can see the bottom corners of my windshield even though it is mounted just in front of the rear view mirror
The image quality is good enough to read licence plates


The accelerometer helps keep my driving in check (it beeps when over certain limits) and marks any videos of interest.The GPS feature is also handy

I used it to log my vacation road trips, and it was already helpful in re-tracing my drive to find a few spots that we stopped at that are hard to find on google maps
I use the iPhone app to download video data and an SD card reader to get the GPS data.I use a 32GB SanDisk SSD card which holds more then 12 hours of driving.My only problem so far with the camera is the chrome lens ring, and silver mount


I wanted the camera to be inconspicuous


It is small enough to mount in front of the rear view mirror, and is barely visible to anyone in the car


But on the outside the chrome and silver reflect a lot of light and are in fact eye catching


So I ended up having to paint the two parts in flat black paint.

$REVIEW.: After approximately a year of constant (ab)use, my pair of j3 buds have stopped functioning 100% properly. Like my j2 buds the year before, the left ear's sound stopped working. However, after I bought a pair of Xtreme Xplosives In Ear at my local mall, the left earbud magically worked again.With that, I immediately had an urge to compare this, the aformentioned earbuds, and what I remember of my j2 buds... before my j3 buds' left speaker stopped working altogether.I personally like the j3 buds a lot. Much more than my old j2 buds. The j2 buds had better bass, but far less clarity. I thought the j3 buds were my perfect headphones. That I didn't need bass.However, after listening to the xtreme xplosives... I changed my mind. While the clarity is a tiny bit less compared to the j3 buds (but better than the j2 buds) the amount of bass I was missing was very clear, even if it felt almost unnatural in the xtreme xplosives.That said, these earphones are for those that want treble clarity and some bass to go with it. Your musical preferences will determine if you like these or not.One nagging issue I had with the j3 buds though was the cord length. It's only slightly shorter than the j2s and these xtreme xplosives... but it was enough of a difference to make the buds be pulled off from my ears when I reached for something further away from my laptop. Even with that constantly happening the past year though (average once a week), the j3 buds kept working until yesterday without a hitch.
$review_summary.: Good treble clarity, bass is a bit soft.

$review_text.: I used this monitor with a small camera:TaoTronics TT-CC06 Universal Car Rear View Bracket Mount Backup Camera (Waterproof IP67 / Color CMOS / 170 Degree Viewing Angle / Distance Scale Line)and created a backup camera system for my truck for less then $45.  Monitor is bright, and is easily viewed during a bright sunny day (direct sunlight on it, would probably not work well).  I have it mounted via double face tape on my truck dash.  The camera and monitor are powered from my backup lights, so they only come on when the truck is in reverse.  The only issue is the power leads have copper wire that is about the thickness of a piece of thread.  So I soldered 18 gauge wire to the power leads at my work bench.  That way I could use crimp connectors when installing in my truck.

Install was literally plug 'N play with no hiccups in usage

The only negative thing I can comment on is with the power in, my computer speakers have a small level of static emitting from them, probably due to the power being pushed down the USB line
Overall if you are looking for a great USB port hub this little device is the TOPS.

$review_text.: These are hands down the finest headphones I have ever heard. Ever.I'm an early adopter. I like new gadgets. I know about X-Fi. So I jumped at the chance to buy these headphones. They aren't cheap - but they're not the most expensive cans on the market either.I thought my iPod sounded fine with the earbuds that came in the box. Not great but not bad. I was wrong. EVERYTHING sounds bad when compared to these bad boys from the geniuses behind X-Fi. I don't really understand HOW X-Fi works. But I understand what it does: it makes my MP3s and iTunes music sound better. Simple as that.I do have one minor complaint. Like all noise-cancelling headphones, the sound bleeds from the Aurvana X-Fis. So you might bug your neighbor a little bit on a long flight. Hahaha! I don't think the bleed is worse than in any other pair of headphones. Just thought I'd mention it anyway.

$REVIEW.: I bought this keyboard to replace a noisier keyboard used by an aggressive typer in the office. The clacking noise of his old keyboard was driving his office-mates mad. This keyboard was certainly quieter, but not as quiet as I anticipated. Instead, I gave that employee my own chiclet keyboard by Rosewill and kept this one for myself. It's got a surprisingly good feel for this style of keyboard, and I have no complaints. I merely expected it to be quieter than it was.

$REVIEW.: My wife, the recipient of this gift could not get any sound out of the "radio", and, lo and behold, it was NOT a radio at all, but just a tuner.  I attached sound-powered speakers to see if it worked at all.  In this area, 20 miles or more from transmitters, it picked up half a dozen HD "talk", PBS, and news stations plus a dozen more HD FM music stations.  With the antennas provided it then did well on a few "hard to get" standard (non-HD) AM and FM, however.  The unit is small and had handy presets and a useful remote control.  So, definitely a "mixed bag".  The Sony is small and inexpensive, with very decent quality, though not a radio, and HD is much overhyped.  Yet, OK for the price as long as you know what you are getting.  I would not spend more for HD.  Would I have been better off giving an internet radio?  Depends entirely on which stations you are trying to get.  Neither to be rejected out of hand nor accepted without understanding of its limitations.  Sony has a good name, and justly so.

$REVIEW.: I purchased the dockStubz adapter so that I could charge my iPod Nano (6th gen) while also using an accessory, such as the Griffin Navigate remote control. As advertised, the dockStubz adapter allows a straight pass through between the male and female 30 pin dock connectors. I was able to use the Navigate remote both with and without power coming in to the mini-USB connector on the side of the dockStubz adapter.I was also quite pleased to discover that the mini-USB connector on the side of the dockStubz adapter also allows you to sync your iPod with your computer. I didn't see this feature advertised anywhere, but it is certainly a welcome addition. This could help some people reduce the number of cables that they have to carry.The 30 pin connectors on my dockStubz are quite tight- to the point of being difficult to connect to my iPod Nano. On the plus side, I know that the connector won't just slip out on its own. I would imagine that the connector will loosen up a little over time, hopefully to a snug, but not too tight fit. The tight fit might be by design, so that iPods and iPhones that are docked have enough support so that they won't fall over.I only gave 3 stars for look and feel because there is a somewhat rough seam on the plastic from the molding. The plastic itself seems to be of good quality, and I'm certainly not worried about it ever breaking (without major abuse anyway). The look and feel isn't bad by any stretch, it's just not extraordinary either.5 stars overall- I was looking for function, and this product delivered even more than I expected. I would strongly recommend this accessory to others.

$REVIEW.: Wonderful for international travel! Or even domestic. You only need to carry one non-US electrical socket adapter plug - to plug this cord into the wall socket abroad. Then you can use this extension cord to connect up to 4 or 6 (depending on model you get) electrical devices. Light weight. Works on 110 or 220 lines no problem. It has earned a place into my on-the-road electrical gear bag forever. And the plug cover actually lights up to let you know current is being passed through it. Nice touch.

$REVIEW.: Got this product because my Asus Netbook doesn't have TV-out.  I used the RGB-to-RCA connector.  Picture quality streaming Netflix to a 5-year old 42" Panasonic EDTV Plasma TV is a bit rough; very washed-out but can't expect much more with compressed video over the Internet, converted to RGB, and then to RCA.  I haven't tried it yet but I expect playing a DVD on the Netbook would be better quality.  We had borrowed a Nintendo Wii for a short period.  Streaming Netflix using the Wii is much, much better quality.  But, it's $200 more :)

$review_text.: .Paid $[...] for this in April 2010.  Biggest waste of money I ever spent.  not worth the hassle of getting it repaired.  Made me miserable and unhappy for three days.  This is not how I want to spend my life--feeling miserable and abused and wondering how I got suckered into this huge mistake.The good--or perhaps the OK--I found nothing really good.GSM service is free for purchasing books and most uses. Not all that valuable.  I'd be happy with just WiFi and enough memory to carry around a personal library. with me.  GSM available for anything else but books.  Wifi works ok, after some fussing with the settings.  Many times I got error messages.  I kept trying until it worked.  There is some issue with the Wifi but it can be fussed with until it works--starting and stopping it.The bad--just about everything:I travel a lot, and need to carry my library with me.  This device does not work to download books outside of the US.  Why not?  I can understand the GSM not working, but if I have WiFi access somewhere, I should be able to load anything I want anywhere.  I can load books anywhere with my iPod Touch. Requires a US address.  Why?  Why can't anyone use it?  Device requires that you sign up with B&N; with a credit card.  Why can't I download free books without a B&N; account?  You cannot use this device until it is registered.This device is barely functional.  The interface is poorly designed, B&N; does a great job of making it difficult to find free books, and the books that are normally free--B&N; charges you $1 to $2 for these books! Outrageous!  Most people would not have a clue they are being ripped off being charged for books in the public domain.The interface is so bad that everyone is hacking these devices to make them functional.  Do a GOOGLE search for nook soft root--better yet check out YouTube and search for TROOK.Do a search on nook itself for free and you won't find free books, you will find books with "free" in the title or crippled editions with two chapters free.  There is no menu selection for find free books.  If you do find a free book it will be after wading through page after page of the same title--it would take days to find even a few interesting free books.  With the Kindle, at least you get to choose a few best sellers are part of your purchase price.  The B&N; give you nothing for free but garbage.  They want to frustrated enough to pay them more money for overpriced books.  Personally I can't see paying the same price for an electronic book as I do a paper bound book that I can resell or give as a gift.  Electronic books cost nothing to produce and distribute--why do they cost so much?  It is gouging, IMHO.To get a free book into your nook is a nightmare PITA.  I use an iPod Touch and was able to load 60 free books into it, in about 8 minutes--easy and simple.  Not menu after menu and then find out the book was not loaded after all.With B&N; nook it takes a long time to select and load a book.  You have to pay for a book, even if it is zero dollars--another menu choice, just to get you in the habit of hitting a purchase button.  There are lots of free books out there.  Why should it be hard to load these? Personally, I want a large library with me because I travel alot, and I want to find  what I want quickly, and I want to read it without hassle.PFD files can be loaded but these are not re-sized, so that type is pretty small and hard to read.  I can't read them, and I have reasonably good near vision.  If you are young with perfect vision you might be able to read for a while until your eyes get tired.  PDF don't work well on this device.Changing a page is a pain with the controls.  There is a way to use a finger swipe that some people have difficulty with.I personally hate wading through 40-60 pages on the life of the author, at the beginning of the book when all I want to do is read the book itself.  Books with a ton of crap in the front, with articles about the life of the author, acknowledgments, are a PITA toget around.  Scrolling down to chapter one to start the book is problematic--sometimes you are sent back to the index, other times you go to Chapter one. Why should I have to scroll and enter a command twice.  Why can't it work the first time?I constantly had the urge to use the white part of the device as a touch screen, but only the bottom is a touch screen.  I found myself thinking, my iPod Touch is better than this.  It is fast to touch what I want.  Give me something better like a Blackberry pointer ball!Display is flashing every time a page is changed.  I found this constantly annoying.  Why?  There is no reason for the flashing.  EVERY PAGE FLASHES AT YOU!  YOU WILL LEARN TO HATE IT!!!!USB power connector.  This is a weak spot of the device.  Instead of using a robust connector, they use a micro USB connector. It is wobbly. Even a mini-USB would have been better.  At times I  could not make this connector work.  It is delicate.  It doesn't want to mate up.  I found I needed to be very precise on aligning it, even then it would not connect.  I doubt that this will survive 100 re-connections.  If you buy this device, do not expect it to last more than two years.  It would be smart to get the extended warrantee--another $60 for two years--If you buy a nook.  Charge it only when you have too, or you will wear out this connector in a short period of time.  While the battery life is good, given the crappy connector, I don't understand why they didn't put a battery 2-3 times larger in this device so that the connector would last longer and have less wear.Memory Storage is limited to about 1GB with space to add another memory card.  To bring it up to 8 or 16 GB, it will cost you another $30 to $60, or if you buy it from B&N; it will be twice as much.  I feel the device is worthless without at least another 8GB of storage.  I'd rather it came with another 16GB.  The iPad comes with that much or more--so you get a color full touch screen for not much more than the cost of the memory you need.This is a good gift for someone clueless about electronics that won't know any better about how badly B&N; crippled their android operating system and don't understand what a good interface is all about.Do yourself a favor.  Try an iPod Touch, and I assume the iPad works as well.  Apple makes quality products that work right, with strong connectors, great software, and are backed up with the highest rated customer support.  B&N; built something with one purpose only, to sell electronic books--and to make it difficult to find free books, and to break quickly.  If you want to be screwwed over, buy one of these and then bend over because B&N; sees you as someone to be used and abused--not a valuable customer.If B&N; made it easy to download free books, I'd be more forgiving on the crappy software they use and the delicate power connector.  If B&N; made a decent, usable interface, and made it easy to load whole library's of free books, I'd probably buy some electronic books and they would earn my business.  As it is, I will never buy an e-Book or any other book from B&N.;  That is how angry I am about wasting money on this product.My nook is dead after only three days.  I wish I could return it.  I don't have the original packaging either, so that even if I got a new replacement, I cannot sell it on eBay to get my money back.  I'm not sure what I'll do.  I will be calling B&N; tomorrow to see about a replacement, and begging for a store credit instead so I can buy an iPad instead.The bottom line is, I'm more than disappointed about the product.  I'm angry enough that I'll never do business with B&N; again--even if they refund me the price of this device.  I don't even want it back if it were repaired.I'd rather pay $600 for an iPad, purchasing from a company that charges a lot for products that are well thought out and work well.  While I may wish the price was less for Apple products, at least I don't have this awful feeling of being screwwed ten different ways by B&N; with their service and nook product.For those who think this is a good product.  You are fools who don't know enough to make a valid judgment.  I laugh at you, because your nook will be dead within a year.

$REVIEW.: Like many drivers, I keep two sets of car keys and, consequently, am usually able to find one and get on the road.  The only thing distinguishing the two sets is a tiny, penny-sized fob, which admits me to a building and radio studio.  Of course, when I'm able to find only one of my two sets, the one I can't find is invariably the one with the fob.  The show must go on but not if I'm not there to go on along with it.  After my most recent near-miss, I decided it was time to take matters in hand and look for a key-finder.  Amazon offers a decent variety, most of them, it seems, unable to muster more than one or two stars from dissatisfied customers.  This one ranked higher in consumer satisfaction than most and, moreover, from a large number of reviewers--surprising, given its low profile, unless it's a model formerly carried by Amazon and recently discontinued. Nevertheless, the remaining dealer of the Easy 2 Find locator shipped it out immediately, and it does appear to be up to the task.  Although the price isn't necessarily reflected in the materials, the seller thoughtfully includes five spare batteries (hearing-aid-type discs that can easily run [...] bucks).  You may not wish to be too quick to remove the tab that activates the pre-installed batteries.  Battery-life is estimated to be 3-6 months, so in the event of an emergency, it would probably be quicker to go to a fresh remote control than fumble with installing a new battery.  Two of the remotes are designed to fit on a key chain; the other two are designed to be fastened to a flat surface (a switch for a TV set?).  The instruction sheet is uncomplicated, though if the "purple" remote looks more like gray to you, the problem is probably not with your eyes.Just do your best to remember which color on the transmitter goes with which remote.  Above all, make a pledge--consider having a public witness or notary present--that the area where you place the minuscule transmitter (actually, it's the same size as one of the remotes) will under no circumstances be violated, trespassed upon, fouled with competing clutter.  The system is only as good as the transmitter, so it needs to remain in a place where you can always count on finding it.  (You may wish to consider some similar devices that contain both a transmitter and a receiver--in other words, a "two-way" locator, assuring that if one key is lost, the other may be able to find it).As the instructions indicate, the range is no better than 60 feet (I'd be inclined to say closer to 50).  The remote flashes a light and beeps loudly enough to be heard within 50 feet (the usefulness of the light eludes me--better the extra power be used to extend the life of the battery).  Trying the device upstairs, I was able to make the remote chirp responsively from every room except when I tried to signal it from the bathroom (maybe it figured it would be rude to serenade me there).  When I walked down a couple of stairs from the upstairs level, the remote stopped acknowledging my petitions.  Just don't put too much pressure on the locator or yourself, move from room to room, keep depressing the right-colored button, and help should soon arrive.

$REVIEW.: First let me say this, recently I've had the fortune to use a bunch of different keyboards at home and at work. Most of these ended up being gaming keyboards with functionality such as programed keys and back lit lighting.The sidewinder x4 keyboard is definitely a solid keyboard for that purpose. If you look at the market most of the other keyboards are extremely heavy priced with functionality like LCD screens to tell you about what's going on for your computer etc. While this is all great the added value doesn't always match the price increase for this sort of stuff. We pay enough for our computers when we're gaming let alone our keyboards.Either way this keyboard's button positions are in a 'normal' layout (some gaming keyboards tend to squish the buttons to fit extra ones in) and it works fine with quick responsiveness. The lighting is pretty cool at night when I'm playing but aside from that it's mostly just a stylistic plus for me... I know where the keys are for the most part so I don't get too much out of that feature besides reinforcing my lurking in the basement, playing with video games, and being bathed in monitor and keyboard glow stereotype.Either way, it's a solid buy.

$REVIEW.: This is a good low cost no frills USB drive to help get files from A to B.It does this job just fine.If feels a bit cheapy, very light no cap or retracting usb connector but those things are not needed for its function.The bit issue is the fact that this is one of the new &#34;Windows 8 Certified&#34; USB drives from SanDisk that has changed how the storage is detected by your computer.It WILL NOT show up as &#34;removable storage&#34; but instead as a &#34;Local Disk&#34; to this extent you can still move files from A to B just fine, but if your in need of making this a boot device there are many (most) programs that will only detected &#34;removable storage&#34; as a device to format and install programs and boot media onto it.I work in the IT industry and I purchased this to make a bootable device for portable windows, and emergency boot tools and I can not do this since all my programs only allow me to use removable storage for the process.So this device was retired from being a really great tool to just a file storage device.If thats what you need go for it, if your into IT or may want to use this to boot programs you better find a brand that is not doing this or at least offers you a tool that allows you to &#34;flip the bit&#34; that tells your operating system what type of storage it is.Id sent it back if it was not more trouble than what its worth.SanDisk needs to get with the program and get a tool out to switch these back and forth between storage device type like other companies have done, and from what I read on the forums SanDisk is aware of the issue and complaints and publicly stated they have no intention of bringing us (the customers) this capability.So as a long time SanDisk customer, I say goodbye!
$review_summary.: It works, nothing special but one important factor to be aware of.

$REVIEW.: This item does what it is made for and does it very well
I find it indispensable to manually adjust focus on the exact object that is not sitting under the AF sensor point(s)

The original focusing screen (e.g., Eg-A II in 6D) is not made for adjusting focus with large aperture lenses


After replacing it to Eg-S, I can reliably manually adjust focus on the exact object off the AF sensor point with AF, or under MF mode, with f/1.2 or 1.4 lens
I personally prefer composing first then micro-adjusting focus to AF on the object and recomposing the frame
While Eg-S gives a slightly darker viewfinder than Eg-A II, this is clearly not a problem if you are shooting with large aperture lenses indoor/outdoor, or f/4 lenses under good amounts of light or outdoor
By the way, it is easy to replace focusing screens

Just follow the instruction that comes with the screen
Oh, don't forget to select Eg-S for setting under your camera menu (Custom Function Settings).

$review_text.: Wanted a cheap, versatile case for an ipad 2. This turned out to be a good choice. I take my ipads in and out of their cases a lot to put them in music stand clips, and I like the way this case holds the device and how easy it is to get it in and out - just un-do the little velro retainer on the LH side, and slide that puppy out (or back in). The magnetic auto-on/off cover is nice, too, and works fine. Perfect for your iPad 2, 3 (retina display) or 4. It's also nice and lightweight! I had another style case for my 1st gen iPad, but the case added so much weight to an already heavy device!

$REVIEW.: The headphones have superb quality for the size and price, especially. I have used them and my 2yr old grandson have used them for his portable DVD player. They fit snugly in his ears and I change the covers and they securely fit mine as well. I would LOVE to get in on another deal like I did to get another pair! I gave one pair to my 12 yr old nephew as a Christmas Gift for his PSP. He also loves them and said he also loves the pouch that comes with them. It is great for keeping them untangled and with the keyring pouch, it easily attatches to the zipper on his PSP carrier or my grandson's laptop case. The only downfall I have on these is that I want my own pair that I don't have to share. A GREAT PRODUCT!

$review_text.: This little adapter allows you to mount your legacy Canon FD mount lenses on Canon EOS bodies, and retain the ability to focus to infinity.  For the price, it is adequate.  It does physically mount the lens and focus to infinity.  But the cheap glass used in this adapter is not of highest quality.  You will notice a loss of resolution and contrast.  It will vignette with long lenses on a full frame body.  Still, for the money it serves acceptably.  If you want a special purpose or very expensive FD lens to mount on your EOS camera, this will work -- with the caveats noted.  Many of us have fond memories of using high quality Canon FD lenses and for that purpose this can still be an enjoyable tool.Background:  When Canon went to autofocus, they built an adapter for their FD lenses like this one, but it was much superior optically and mechanically.  There was a second macro version that Canon made, with no glass and hence no focus to infinity.  They were only supplied to their Canon Professional Services members in limited volumes.  These were both high quality Canon products.  Unfortunately they are now rare and a collectors' items, quite expensive if you can find one.Cheap clones of both versions are now widely available.  This Opteka adapter is typical of the version with glass.  There are also clones of the version without glass that serve well for FD macro lenses, when you probably don't need to focus to infinity. If you are using a full frame sensor camera with a long lens, it will probably vignette badly using the version with optics.  It will not vignette but also not focus to infinity in the version without glass, so be aware of these limitations.As a convenience, some of the clones also have a so-called "AF confirm" chip that allows you to use the camera's focus sensor to indicate (using the green dot in the viewfinder and the audible beep) when the image is in focus.  Of course you focus manually using the viewfinder, but the camera's AF confirmation can be more accurate and for wide angle and fisheye lenses it is almost mandatory.  The AF confirm feature is available for both versions of the adapter.So be aware that there are many variations of this adapter.  If you might want the AF confirm version, you will want to look for that elsewhere.  If you are shooting macro only, the glassless version will not degrade your optics and is better for that use.  Unfortunately all the clones with glass are just not up to the standards of Canon -- they are barely adequate.

It will bend and since most people want a longer cord for the purpose of using their device in bed or a chair it's perfect.

Well, it worked fine as a power strip and seemed to be a fine surge protector as well, but there was a lot of noise when we cranked the volume up.Upgraded to this guy, and the noise is totally gone.

$review_text.: Apparently Professional Version very similar to Home Version, except about half dozen games are included in Home Version, which is what I installed last time.  Thought maybe Professional Version would be 'better' but Games Directory is EMPTY in professional version... probably because this version is meant more for businesses, and they don't want their employees playing games instead of working, so the half dozen or so games included with the Home Version are NOT included in Professional version!!  Haven't been able to determine if you can download the missing games for free from Microsoft.  Maybe I'll stick with Home Version next time, so I can get the missing games!  (You have to buy a separate copy of Windows for each computer you have!)  Don't know if this has something to do with difference between Windows 7 Home Version and Windows 7 Professional Version but Home Version running under BOOTCAMP on MacBook Pro messes up computer clock and date every time you boot into Windows.. you have to reset computer clock and date!!  On an EXACTLY IDENTICAL MacBook Pro running Windows 7 Professional Version, there are NO PROBLEMS with computer clock...  maybe it's worth it to pay $$$ EXTRA for Windows 7 Professional if you plan on running under BOOTCAMP on MacBook Pro just to avoid computer clock issues...  Some people say Windows 7 actually runs better on MacBook Pro than on PC!  Ironically, I'm almost liking it better than the MAC OS, because in the Medical Professions, our work eMail (based on Microsoft Outlook) and various medical related sites (HealthStream, American Heart Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, etc) are all more supported and run better in Windows than in MAC OS (some of those sites do NOT support MAC / Apple at all!)  UPDATE!: Someone posted reply informing me the GAMES actually ARE there, they're just "hidden"  There is an obscure configuration Menu in which you can click a check box, and the games will all miraculously appear!  Unfortunately, I can't remember where it is!  On subsequent installations, spent hours hunting through various configuration menus looking for it until I finally stumbled across it!  This "hidden" menu also allows you to turn on and off various other functions in Windows!  If something doesn't work, maybe its turned off in that Menu!  I Learned Win 7 Professional has "Mobility Center" Applet catering to LapTops, that apparently IS NOT included in Win 7 Home Premium.  Also recently found out another Strange Fact about Windows 7 --all the needed software for the 'Higher' versions of Windows 7 is ALREADY INSTALLED on the 'Lower' Versions!  You can "Upgrade" to HIGHER Versions (Home Premium --> Professional --> Ultimate) Microsoft will sell you ($$$) an "UnLock Key" through "AnyTime Upgrade" which when entered into your existing Win 7 will "UNLOCK" the additional added features and functionality of the higher version of Windows 7 you paid for in the 'Upgrade'  --is simpler than having to Re-Install whole new Version -all existing settings will be preserved!!

I am using it with the AYL Mini Touch BoomBox Portable Bluetooth Wireless Version 4.0...B00E8TXJC0on an Acer laptop and it links up with no problem. One hint: right click on the "speaker" icon (Windows 7), click on "playback devices", right click in the "playback"  window and checkmark  "show disconnected devices" and "show disabled devices" if they aren't already.  Do it for the record window too. It drove me nuts for a bit when I couldn't see the Boombox (it shows "headset") in the playback window, but could in the record window. The unit is TINY, for sure.

$REVIEW.: Update:  You do need the USB 3.0 which is a blue USB port to charge the headphones.Setting up the headphones was really a lot more complicated than I ever thought possible but I finally got them to work, although it took me some time figuring it out.  I simply tried to plug them in without reading the instructions when they needed to be charged.  Also I had to use the USB extension for it to work on my desktop..not sure why.So it also wouldn't charge on my desktop pc but charged on my laptop so I thought it needed USB 3.0 but the manual says just USB 2.0 is fine.  Never figured that out, so after charging on my laptop took it back to my desktop, and after changing the default settings in Control panel the sound worked.  The sound is wonderful compared to my speakers.I bought my daughter Sennheiser headphones for Christmas and they are light and cushy and worked after plugging them in.  So much simpler it seemed at the time.  The Corsair are heavier although not alot.  The earpads sit around the edge of my ears and not directly on them which I like and the headband was simple to adjust.  I'm listening to the Carpenters after all that hard work and the sound is pretty amazing, I must admit.  They block out more noise than the Sennheiser's.  I think it's a pain they have to be charged though but it's cord free which offsets that I guess.

$REVIEW.: For the most part, the camera works pretty well.Likes:1) The night vision is pretty good.2) Wireless functionality works well.3) Price is great for what you get.Dislikes:1) The color image is barely color.  It looks as if the color intensity is turned way down and/or washed out.2) The motion detection seems to false alarm a lot.  Perhaps the sensitivity needs better calibration.3) There doesn't seem to be a way to record video.4) Not sure how weather resistant the dangling ethernet and power ports are.  I'd recommend coming up with a way to enclose them in something when used outdoors.5) Not having all the "control panel" options for the 'visitor' user would be nice.  No need to confuse people with a bunch of buttons/menus which don't work.  I was hoping there would be a way to simply show the video, with no menus/options, but this doesn't appear to exist.

$REVIEW.: This is easy to use and looks very nice. for full sized pictures, you can only load the pictures either all horizontal or all vertical inless you want very small ones going the opposite direction to the way the frame is sitting. No big deal to me. They have an enormous cord for this thing so you have to have some place to hide all the wires.

$review_text.: I had (and backed) the Nifty MiniDrive. It was flaky at best, cheaply made, and easily came apart.This JetDrive is anything but that. Rock solid build, fits snuggly, and I'm getting great speeds considering it's an SD card. The list max speed rates are pretty spot on. Formatted as OS Extended I'm getting about 30-40mb/s write and 85-90mb/s read, which is plenty fast for what I'm using it for: offloading media so I have more room for more things on my internal SSD. I have no real use for an SD card, so this is a perfect solution.A bit pricey, but so far a superb product.

$REVIEW.: After a couple of years attempting to find the right Bluetooth, I found and purchased LG Electronics Tone + HBS 730. And boy I hit the jack pot with this. Now let me tell you, I am very weary about bluetooth products and their safety. Yet I am a field worker, and needed something to work with both with my IPOD touch and personal cell phone. This product did it for me. It can actually work with two separate gadgets I was amazed! For example, I have a 64 gig IPOD Touch, and a cell phone. This LG head set can handle both gadgets simultaneously. So while I am listening to music, and the phone happens to ring, I can hit the answer button, take the call, and when I'm done, it reconnects to my IPOD and the music picks up where it left off. The sound is great, why, I am brain tumor survivor and virtually lost 95% of hearing in my left ear. So I needed something to go deep in my both ears to balance out the sound and this works great. It comes with three sizes of plugs so you can find the one which works for you. I love this gadget, bottom line IT WORKS, this product does what it says it does, and not many products can make this claim. LG does! I love this head set and have to regrets on purchasing it. Now how many Bluetooth head sets give you simultaneous uses, I can tell you this one does. It even speaks to you, when you turn it on its says " Power on Battery High" and it will say "Connected, Connected" (if your connecting two gadgets). It can also tell you "battery medium" and "battery Low". The down side? I don't like throwing things away. Companies need to upgrade these products so the batteries can be changed. I don't like waste, once the battery is up, it goes in the trash. LG and all Bluetooth head sets operate in this very sad fashion. Great product highly recommended.

$review_text.: This unit replaced myTomTom ONE Portable GPS Vehicle Navigatoras it has updated maps and I liked the larger screen.  In addition, it adheres right to my windshield, unlike the previous one. I used a `bean bag' holder for that.  The screen seems to be brighter and the font sizes are larger and easier to read.  Uploading the map information and all the settings took a little over two  hours.  The voice settings are more numerous with language choices, voice settings and an option to turn off `voice guidance', which can be a nuisance sometimes.I would recommend you set up your `safety setting', `volume', `status bar settings' etc. before you get in your car.  Before you drive, set up your  'plan route' and other requirements before getting on your way.  Once driving, it's very easy to simply tap the screen to change your viewpoint (2D or 3D), but be cautious while driving to do any of these.This unit contains many more extras than my previous one, including alarms for just about anything.  You can set an alarm to go off if you are speeding or approaching a traffic light safety camera.  You can also turn on/off the vocal commands or alarms.  The screen will display your location with street names your speed against the posted speed, length of travel (both miles traveled and the miles to go), the current time and the number of minutes to get to your destination.  All of the functions on this unit are amazingly intuitive.  If you go into a tunnel, the Tom Tom picks right back up where it left off.There are some states where it is illegal to mount a navigational device on the windshield, California being one of them.  However, you can temporarily mount it or use a `bean bag' holder, as I do.  It's also a good idea to have it plugged in often, as the batteries do not last an extremely long time.  This version of the Tom Tom is by far the easiest and sophisticated one so far.

$review_text.: I've used these to internally mount bluetooth and wifi adapters in PC cases to prevent loss or damage to these devices and to free up external ports. They also come in handy to prevent loss or theft of software keys and dongles by hiding them inside of workstations.The ports are very close to one another, if you plan to connect two devices to this adapter, they can't be greater than a certain thickness or they will bind against each other. I stripped the housing from a large-ish flash drive in order to allow it to fit alongside a wireless adapter. Most of these flash drives have internal circuitry far smaller than their housings indicate. \This adapter is also perfect for drive bay-mounted accessories that use a standard USB type A plug rather than a typical motherboard connector header for connection. Keeps internal cabling fully inside a PC case.My biggest gripe is the female socket for the motherboard header isn't very tight fitting. If a PC with this adapter has any sort of heavy devices or cables attached, it could get dislodged in transit or rough handling.

$REVIEW.: This thumb drive lasted less than a year of daily use.  I used a USB port extender cable to try to lessen the wear-and-tear on the drive's USB interface.  After days of no problems in use and being frequently transferred between computers, I ejected the drive using the Windows Explorer eject function.  No computer would read the drive after that.  No green light, no mounting sound, nothing.  The one thing that that was different was that I was using a new work lap top for the first time,  As noted, it functioned fine when mounted to the computer and ejected properly, but would not work again in any computer after that, including the one it had just been ejected from.Because I regularly backed up the drive to an external hard drive at home, and synced the most used files to another location at work using a free Microsoft utility called Sync Toy 2.1, I lost no critical data and have decided that I will not pursue recovering data from the device.  Still, the failure of the drive was inconvenient and annoying.  Most users of these drives know that they do not last forever, but my prior ones have lasted much longer than a year.  Viewing flash memory drives as (un)reliable as old school spinning drives is the best policy.  It could fail today, it could fail in five years, but it will fail.My new thumb drive is from Iogear.  It is different in that it is a card reader for a variety of SD cards.  My hope is that having the flash memory on a removable card will reduce the vulnerability of my data to hardware failures.  Instead of having to toss out the whole drive, I will hopefully be able to move the SD card to a new reader and keep on going.

$review_text.: My tv has only 2 hdmi inputs and i have 3 hdmi devices; so imagine to have to connect and disconnected each one every time a need to switch from one to other; not any more; with thisadapter, you connect up to 3 devices with hdmi output; you just have to connect the output of the adapter to the tv and with the adapter remote control, select which input you want to seeAlso it has a selector button on the adapter and a automatic selection mode, which will select the hdmi input of the device that is on; the issue of this mode is that most of the modern device keep sending the hdmi signal even when they are in standby like the apple tv or the roku; so you better use the adapter's remote control

$REVIEW.: This is my third Garmin unit in the last 10 or so years


 My last one was a StreetPilot 2720, which I still use and love, while my wife primarily uses this 765T and I do when we drive her car.This review is based mostly around the NJ/NY metropolitan area.I really wanted to like this unit, but my wife and I both hate it:1
Routing is really terrible, especially compared to the 2720


 The routes are so convoluted sometimes, it makes absolutely no sense at all
 This is a frequent occurence, while with the 2720, it was a pretty rare occurence.2


It's slow to refresh, especially compared to the 2720.3


It gets caught behind quite a bit

 The 2720 lets you know ahead of time that a turn is coming up, then again about 3 to 5 seconds before you actually have to turn


 This one warns you the first time, but the second warning comes 1 second before to several seconds AFTER you were supposed to turn.4
As others have said, the traffic feature is a nightmare
 It constantly changes it's mind, and it will take you on the most insane side routes to avoid what it thinks is traffic

 The side routes always take longer than your common sense
 These avoidances have increased our travel times significantly so many times, we finally just turned it off.5


The bells and whistles such as lane assist are sort-of useless since it only shows up in about 1 or 2% of situations.So overall, a real piece of crap, I'd say
 The basics are so poor, and it has ADDED time to our trip so many times, we cringe when we need to rely on it for a trip, and especially when we think we bought the "Top of the line."For all you out there thinking about a new GPS device, do something I forgot to do:  buy something cheap with the basics because all the state of the art technology usually takes some time to iron out, and you can buy it for half price later.

$review_text.: I still have my good old Nikon F2 -- bought new 31 years ago. And I still use it with pleasure. But this is the digital age after all, and after my wonderful 4-star (I loved it, but that toggle switch in the back is its Achille's heel!!) Fuji A340 digital camera bit the dust, I decided to bite the bullet, spend some $$ and get a Nikon digital camera.Based on what I read about it, the D50 was a good choice for me -- I have been exhibiting my photos on an off for years, enjoy being able to switch from Auto to Manual mode, and as an artist and Nikon afficionado, I decided that I'd be comfortable with this camera, and I was NOT wrong!!The 28-80mm Zoom lens gives me what I want -- flexibility and a good depth of field. The camera, lightweight and well-balanced, fits my hand and its ergonomics are stellar -- I can reach every function button with relative ease.The many and versatile functions on this camera are as numerous as the stars in the sky -- I am forever reading the owner's manual, but each time I do, I learn a bit more.My only complaint (and this seems to be a universal one as far as most digital cameras are concerned) is the short but noticeable lag between pressing the shutter and the actual recording of the photo -- fast "action shots" can be comppromised this way, without a good bit of pre-planning, and the recording of spontaneous shots could be missed by a fraction of a second.Carrying an extra memory card as well as an extra,pre-charged battery is a must.The Nikon D50 6.1MP Digital SLR Camera with 28-80mm f3.3-5.6G AF Nikkor Zoom Lens camera is a pleasure to own and use. I almost feel guilty when I put it away after using it -- it sits next to my F2, and sometimes I want to apologize to my F2 for "ignoring" it.

The color is actually quite a bit duller than in the image, which was great for me. Some people might be disappointed though. I do agree with the other reviewers that this is not a good cover if you want to change styles frequently, or like to read on a naked device. I like that it has a solid feel to it. It's safe, surrounded by rubber sides, and it's clearly not going to accidentally fall out anywhere. The cover can be easily folded back for one handed reading and the magnetic clasp is a nice touch. I think they hit this one out of the park!

My parents now use it as a specific location to write grocery items on in the kitchen.I have used it with patients who have had a stroke (for communication) - it doesn't wipe away if the hand slips like a dry erase board, but you can still clear it and re-use it when necessary, which is handy.You can write with your finger nail if you don't have the pen on you.It is NOT a place to write items to permanently save.

$review_text.: If you are paying anything more than $5-6 per one HDMI cable you are overpaying. Great HDMI cables, these Amazon Basic HDMI Cables are of superior quality at an Excellent price!!! I will never pay full retail price for a HDMI cord.Remember shorter is always best=better signal transfer.  The typical best ones due to length are the 6ft/6.5ft cables. I have a few of these just laying around as spares - for $5 a pop, you end up being a lifesaver when your mom needs help connecting her new &#34;movie box&#34; to the television screen...These are great cables to own.

$review_text.: Not every lcd panel is made the same. If you want multiple of the same screen and actually want them to look the same, get them at one time and of the same manufacture date and revision...the color tone of the backlight itself and the way it was manufactured affects the picture quality.I purchased 2 of these from my local Micro Center store. They are Manufactured January 2013 and are Rev. LTM111.A month later, this model went on sale on New egg, a friend of mine purchased it from there for me as a gift so that I could complete my nvidia 3d surround setup of 3 23in monitors.I received the same model(W2371d), but manufactured May 2013, Rev. STM112.The color tone is much warmer on this never revision. All 3 are the same product number(B3A19A). Set to the same settings (brightness/contrast 90, color: cool)There is noticeable color tone difference with this newer one...whites are tanish, and there seems to be more red in the tint. I can easily notice the difference when I drag a window from one screen to the other. I wanted 3 of the same screen..so that they all match each other.I contacted HP (that was hell...took 2 hrs..4 different people...all of which could barely speak english. They had me go through stupid troubleshooting steps that were totally useless and a waste of time. They did not understand what color tone is...they keep thinking I was saying the screen was staying a solid color.)Anyway, HP sent me a "replacement" monitor. It is still revision STM112, but manufactured February 2013...and its still too warm! On my 2 rev LTM111 monitors you can clearly see a bluish tint of the backlight bleed around the edges, but this one, the glow is definitely tanish. (the amount of backlight bleed is noticeable less on the newer revision though)I surmise that HP switched to a different lcd panel with the newer revision. I doubt I will get anywhere with incompetent people at HP support..I doubt they would be able to send me a particular revision hardware anyway.PS: What is the difference between this model (W237d) and the LV2311? The appear identical, specs and all. The guy at the store could only say that that W237d was "A better screen".

The keyboard buttons are not too loud, but they have a satisfying feedback when used. The wrist rest is pretty comfortable as well. As for the range, it is very good as well, so long as there are no large obstructions it seems to be able to be used across rooms. I have successfully used my mouse and keyboard from 12 feet away. (my transmitter receiver stick is plugged into a powered USB hub. Now the mouse: it is well weighted, comfortable to use, precise (I do some gaming) with good buttons.

$review_text.: I used two pre-made cat6 50 ft cables from amazon. I ran the cables through the wall of my house to the outside, then back in to the garage and into a workout room, and ultimately to a TV in there. At first, I noticed "snow" on the image, which I thought was odd since obviously HDMI is not analog. After troubleshooting, I realized I had the adapters backwards, they are clearly marked for sender and receiver, and I didn't pay attention. I reversed them and all was fine. I am carrying both audio and video without issue. The Cat6 cables are running along side power cables without issue.I should note that I am using a 1x2 powered hdmi splitter in my setup, however I did test the setup without the splitter (source straight to workout TV) and it worked fine. I'm using the splitter so my sources can feed two TV's.*edit* one additional note, I did test this unit with my PS3 and 3DTV playing bluray 3D content @ 1080P with audio (wreck it ralph.) The cable was 50 feet of RJ45 in between, it worked fine with this configuration.

$review_text.: I needed an outboard DAC for my laptop that I could plug into my stereo in my bedroom. The laptop DAC was probably fine but the switching power supply for the laptop produced a high-pitched whine that would intrude onto the analog audio out. I already have an HTPC/DAW and didn't want to shell out the dough to build another one, when I just need something to take audio from my laptop (which has a Vista MCE remote for play/pause functionality) and play over the bedroom amp/speakers. Unfortunately, this unit is powered via the USB cable from the laptop, and ... you guessed it, the high pitched whine carries over into the analog side of the outboard DAC too. So for my purposes, not useful. However, I've liked Creative products and this one appears well-designed and built. I'm sure this fits the bill for other apps -- just not mine.

This is a great deal over the more expensive ones and while I kinda wish I went for the 300Mbps output even though I wouldn't reach that unless I was doing file transfers over the network.

$review_text.: Bought on reco from a friend


This is my first ever GPS
So, no experience to compare with others

I used basic routing feature (not POI stuff yet) in a non-urban area (not much tall buildings) for a week now


Here are my observations:1) The pink highlighted driving path is always correct

But the spoken voice directions will mislead you
Sometimes the street it says to turn is not what the posted street sign is

However, the pink highlighted turn is correct

So, best is to turn off the voice directions and follow the highlighted path or when in doubt, give a preference to highlighted path instead of spoken directions
May be a map update will fix this


Will try that.2) You do need to have a general sense of direction where you are going
With a blank mindset of directions, you will make wrong turns with this unit
You can't completely depend on it if you want reach the destination fast


For example, let's say you are on a Freeway 1 and have to go on a connecting Freeway 2 North

And let's say the exit from Freeway 1 is same for both South and North of Freeway 2
This unit tells you first "take exit 10 to Freeway 2 South on right and keep right"


You have to pay attention to that "keep right" part and ignore "South" part

And after you actually take exit and are very close to North/South separation, then it tells you "take exit 10 to Freeway 2 North on right"


Once I followed the South part and ended up in wrong direction on Freeway 2


You'll get used to this quirk after first couple of uses though
Again, the highlighted path is correct
Ignore the spoken directions and follow the path.3) It doesn't seem to pick the closest Freeway on-ramp when it's a bit out of your way


It insists on taking the closest on-ramp that's on the way you are heading even if it involves going through more city lights than going backwards and taking faster on-ramp
Again, your general sense of the area is useful here

EDIT: apparently, this is because of traffic feature
It's trying to avoid those on-ramps because they were congested


During off peak times, it did route thru those on-ramps that are a bit out of the way.4) Traffic feature is actually working and is useful

It did route me around the traffic once

You can find out if your metro area is supported at totaltraffic dot com


That's where these units get traffic updates from


EDIT: I am soooo happy about this traffic feature


Traffic data seems to be accurate


It persistently tried to take me out of the traffic another time on a known route
But I didn't listen to it and took the known route and drove right into traffic jam


It tried to re-route me via 3 exits before that jam.5) Other feature useful is automatic re-routing

When you make a wrong turn and end up somewhere else, it'll get you on track.6) I also noticed that the GPS converges well at 30-40 mile speeds vs

60-70mph i.e


the location where it tells you you are is more accurate when you are moving less than 30-40mph than when you are moving at 60-70mph

That's understandable


The real military accurate GPSs cost thousands of dollars

Most of these consumer GPSs are slow converging and hence have some heuristic (aka guesstimate) based on your speed, the map database and the direction you are heading to figure where exactly you are


EDIT: for example, if it tells you to take an freeway exit and you don't listen to it and continue on the freeway, for a while, it thinks you are actually taking exit and it continues to instruct to turn left or right after exiting
But, after a while, it figures out you are still on freeway and re-calculates.I've just upped my review to 4 stars from 3
Other than #2 and #6, I haven't found major problems
You'll get used to those minor problems in no time


Overall, it will get you where you want to go reliably and faster.

$REVIEW.: Ok, first i should say that I like good even sound, not too much bass or treble, just enough to feel it or hear the clarity of certain notes, etc


First I should say that I rec'd my iBeats with the HTC Rezound - not via a retail package, etc

 I've the Monster Turbines for about 6 months or so

I couldn't get a comfortable fit initially but eventually I got it so they were nice and snug

They have been ok earphones, but not nearly as good as they are touted


Of course I'm not expecting them to sound as good as quality speakers, but based on the reviews here (and some professional ones too) I bought into the hype

If I can describe the sound I would say weak bass (even after getting the good snug fit that is so important), decent midrange and treble

Bigger earphone will of course get you better bass (I have some Bose noise canceling ones that work gave me that sound much better - I'm not a big fan of Bose products either)


Some other over the ear phones that sound good are Philips O'Neill SHO9560/28 Over-Ear Headphones - Black Bordeaux that I purchased for my daughter - wow much better


Regarding the iBeats vs

these Turbines, i have to give the better sound to the iBeats


They are fuller sounding and more neutral in my opinion


If you're wondering, the Beats Audio on the Rezound works with any headphones


So overall a 4 on sound for me (the turbines 3 and the Philips 5 and Bose 4).

The stitching is uniform and strong. A 4" x 3" patch of leather is strategically placed at the bottom to allow for a non-slip grip.The main compartment is lined by smooth soft flannel to prevent scratching of contents.It also has a fold-in divider that comes in handy when carrying my MacBook Air and an iPad, or a pad/few papers etc.Two flat pockets with slit openings, each 5" deep and 4.5" and 3.75" wide respectively are found on the back of the case and serve to carry a mobile phone, iPod, earbuds, a thin flat battery recharger or a small external drive.The case is not meant to protect against damage from dropping on hard floor or a heavy direct knock.A separate matching felt case 4.25" x 3.5" is included for carrying bulky power cords and wall plugs.Another high quality item from "Inateck".

I was glad to have this with me on my trip to the Virgin islands. It was great to use when snorkling! And the fact that you can tighten the strap around your wrist is great, so that it doesn't slip off. I did wish it came in other colors though. And it was so light weight that I eventually lost it while sailing and it blew away (it didn't fit in the camera case--I should have left it attached and hanging out the camera case). But loved it while I had it.The click to remove/attach it to the camera could have been a little easier to use and I have small fingers. Otherwise, great.

$review_text.: Amazon Kindle Touch Lighted Leather Cover, Wine PurpleYou can probably guess that this is not a positive review of the Kindle Touch Lighted Leather Cover. I ordered a cover well before Christmas along with the Kindle Touch 3G. This was to be a Christmas present for my wife. I received the Kindle in plenty of time but the cover arrived just before Christmas. Not a big deal until Christmas morning when she opened the gifts and we found that the light in the cover did not operate. We called customer service and they immediately suggested returning the item without even bothering with any troubleshooting. Additionally, there were no instructions other than a picture card depicting the installation and removal of the Kindle into and out of the cover. Amazon was nice enough to send a UPS call-tag for the cover but I had to reorder another cover and wait for a refund. The refund took 2 weeks and the 2nd cover didn't arrive for 10 days. Guess what? WRONG COVER!!!! I called customer dis-service and without an apology, they sent another call-tag, told me to wait for my refund and order another cover. You'd think I would be smarter than to do that again, but NO-o-o-o-o-o-o! I went ahead and ordered another one and waited for my refund, which took another 2 weeks. It is now 8 weeks since I ordered the original cover and I just received the 3rd one. Third times a charm? Not here!!!! This one doesn't work either!!! I've tried fully charging the Kindle, cleaning the contacts on the back of the unit and cleaning the contacts on the cover without any positive result. I'm about to call customer Dis-service and I know exactly what to expect...nothing. I'm going to patiently wait for my refund and order a cover from someone else!!! I don't care how nice this one was. It doesn't work!!!! Also, the stupid thing costs $59.99 and doesn't even have a clasp to keep it closed in a backpack. Some cover!!!?!BTW, the Kindle Touch 3G works great and my wife loves it! I may even get one for myself but you can bet ALL my accessories will come from a different source than Amazon!UPDATE:After listening to me rant about the ridiculous number of times I had to reorder this cover, Amazon Customer Service cheerfully offered to overnight a new cover without the old refund/reorder nonsense! Things are looking up! Additionally, I got my head out of that dark place (you know the one) and started thinking..."What are the chances of more than one cover being defective?" I tested the power contacts on the back of the Kindle and found there is no power output as there should be but Kindle Customer Service couldn't even tell me what the expected voltage should be! What's up with that?. Turns out, there may be nothing wrong with the covers I've received but with the Kindle itself! What a dufus! I'll try out the new cover tomorrow and update this review further. BTW, Kindle Customer Service has no specs on the expected power output at the terminals/contacts, and no instructions for troubleshooting the Kindle to see if the outputs are working at all. I was able to find tech stuff that they either don't have, or simply don't want to divulge on the Net. But, once again, I have to send in my unit, wait for a refund, and reorder another Kindle Touch 3G. What a pain in the a__ but we may have a solution in sight! More later...QUESTION FOR THE AMAZON COMMUNITY: Why does every other person in AMAZON Customer Service speak with an Middle Eastern/Indian accent? I'm sure the English names they are giving aren't their birth names. And why don't they have technical data on the products they're supposed to be helping troubleshoot? Curiouser and curiouser...Final UPDATE as promised...(Jan. 30, 2012)Got the 4th cover and no joy! I didn't expect it to work as I'd finally come to the conclusion that the Kindle battery contacts are non-functioning. Was just about to make the dreaded call to Amazon Customer dis-Service when, OMG!!!...Kindle/Amazon called me! Apparently they read this review and someone was concerned enough to find out what was going on! I spoke to a great, native-American-English-speaking guy named Andrew who immediately apologized about the series of screwed up encounters I'd had with customer dis-service. He recognized the problem and immediately sent me a new Kindle Touch 2-day delivery, which I got tonight. THAT'S CUSTOMER SERVICE! I popped the new Kindle into the case I received last week and, wait for it....IT WORKS!!!! Had a registration issue but a quick call to customer service got it straightened out once I got to speak to Pete who also grew up speaking American English. For those of you thinking I'm a bigot, I'm not prejudiced against Middle Easterners, I just want to be able to speak with someone who can understand me and to whom I can make myself understood!!! Not too much to ask when having a problem with an expensive device, don't you agree?!? Anyway, problem solved and Amazon has certainly regained my trust and elevated my view of their customer service department. That's all for now! Thanks for your kind attention!

$REVIEW.: This is a basic, solid case for the Kindle Fire

 It has an elastic strap that goes around the edge to hold the cover closed

 While I prefer other cases with a tab closure, this one is really going to protect the Fire perfectly from any damage if it gets dropped

 This is a rugged case that holds the Fire securely and won't allow any damage to come to it


 The price is good too


 For a practical person who wants a basic no frills case for their Kindle Fire, that is an attractive color, this is perfect.

$review_text.: The most important criteria I have for choosing a wireless keyboard is reliable connectivity and a quality construction. This Apple wireless keyboard has met those criteria -- and more! I'm very, very happy with it all-around. From connectivity to build quality to ergonomics to aesthetics, this keyboard has outperformed virtually every wireless keyboard I've used in the past (from Logitech, Microsoft, Dell, and others).- Reliable ConnectivityI have no trouble connecting to my PC and iPhone 4. Once connected, the keyboard maintains its connection. There is also _ZERO_ lag between the time a key is pressed and the time the keypress registers on the screen. It has so far not exhibited the problem with sporadic repeating keystrokes (jussst likkkee thatttt), which is a problem with many wireless keyboards.- Quality BuildThe build is very high quality. The surface, sides, and back end (the cylindrical part) of the keyboard is machined from a single piece of aluminum (the keys are plastic and the bottom has a sheet of plastic tacked on), which gives the keyboard rigidity without adding excessive bulk or weight. Even the end caps of the cylinder are made of aluminum (the left end cap is the cover for the battery compartment and the right end cap is the power button).This keyboard is the most sturdy thin profile keyboard I've seen. Some of the thin profile keyboards I've used (like thischeapie) actually give a little in the middle section when a key is pressed -- not so with this Apple keyboard. With its aluminum framework, the Apple keyboard is perfectly rigid and looks to be ready to withstand some punishment!- Sleek, Compact, and LightweightThis keyboard is a real joy to use because of its sleek visual appeal and its lightweight and compact size. It weighs a mere 11.7 ounces (with 2 AA batteries), which is roughly equivalent to the weight of eleven AA batteries. Its dimensions are about 11" x 5 1/4" x 1/4" (thickness of the main keyboard surface). The raised cylindrical portion of the keyboard, which houses the AAA batteries and power button is slightly less than 3/4".The chicklet-style keyboard (similar to ones on a laptop) is one of the most important elements to the keyboard's sleek visual appeal, and will be a welcome feature for users accustomed to a laptop. I am a touch typist who is unaccustomed to a chicklet-style keyboard, but I adapted very quickly (in a matter of days).- ErgonomicThe keyboard is angled just right for me. The angle is not overly steep. If I change my mind later and decide to adjust the angle of the keyboard, I figured I can always make adjustments by attaching some rubber foam strips to the bottom of the keyboard with some double-sided tape. The keys are intuitively located in their "right" locations for intuitive touch-typing. I looo...ooove the overall feel of this keyboard.- Additional CommentsThe only "drawback" to the keyboard is its lack of a numeric keypad. If a numeric keypad is absolutely indispensable, consider getting theLogitech Wireless Solar Keyboardinstead or a separate Bluetooth numeric keypad such asthis one. Do note, however, that the Logitech Wireless Solar Keyboard is NOT Bluetooth, so you would not be able to connect it devices like a smart phone or an iPad.**** THE REST OF THIS REVIEW IS FOR PC USERS ****Alternatively (for PC users), you can use a program called AutoHotKey to temporarily map your Space, "n", Comma, Period, "j", "k", "l", "u", "i", and "o" keys as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 keys, respectively. After you install AutoHotKey, right-click the "H" icon in the tray area. Select "Edit This Script" from the popup menu. To the text file that opens up, append the following lines:^!n::Send 1return^!,::Send 2return^!.::Send 3return^!j::Send 4return^!k::Send 5return^!l::Send 6return^!u::Send 7return^!i::Send 8return^!o::Send 9return^!Space::Send 0returnand delete the following lines:^!n::IfWinExist Untitled - NotepadWinActivateelseRun NotepadreturnNext, save and close the text file. Right-click the "H" icon in the tray area again, and select "Reload This Script" from the popup menu. That's it. When you press and hold the "control" and "alt" keys simultaneously (or the "command" and "alt" key if you're running the UAWKS program -- more on UAWKS later) the "n", Comma, Period, "j", "k", "l", "u", "i", or "o" keys will be temporarily mapped to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 keys, respectively.- Workarounds For PC UsersFor PC users, the Apple Wireless Keyboard does not support Forward Delete (DEL), Home, End, Page Up, Page Down, Print Screen, and CTRL-ALT-DEL. I suggest a couple of workarounds:(1) Use UAWKS (Unofficial Apple Wireless Keyboard Support) for Windows UsersGo to code google com ((Since Amazon doesn't allow U R L's, the dots have been replaced with spaces. Replace the spaces with dots to reconstitute the U R L) and search for "UAWKS" to download the program (UAWKS is open source, but if you find the program useful, consider making a donation).(Note: In UAWKS, the "command" key (not the "control" key) becomes the CTRL key in Windows. So, if you wish to copy selected text, for example, you would use the "command" + "c" key combination, not the "control" + "c" key combination.)(2) Use SharpKeysSharpKeys is a free program for remapping your keys. You can, for example, "remap" (or change) the F7 key to the Home key, or remap your F9 key to the End key.Here are some accessories you might want to consider getting for you Apple Wireless Keyboard. (1)Keyboard Top Surface Protector(protects your keyboard from crumbs, spills, dust, etc.) and (2) anInductive Charger.**** REVIEW UPDATES ****[Update 2012-07-15]- On TypingNow that I've used the keyboard on a daily basis for a over month, I must say I'm loving it more and more. I've grown *completely* accustomed to the chicklet-style keyboard. The chicklet-style keyboard reduces the "travel" between keystrokes and helps me to touch-type a little faster and more accurately than I was able to with a traditional keyboard! In addition, my silicone keyboard surface protector helps to give the keys a very pleasant tactile feedback. This keyboard has to be the most comfortable keyboard I've ever used!- On UAWKS (Key Customization)I've ditched UAWKS because I find it to be very temperamental. The software would sporadically quit working, which is a real annoyance. I am, however, still using AutoHotKey, which has worked quite well. I've added a few lines to the AutoHotKey script to compensate for the loss in some of the functions after I discontinued using UAWKS. Note: If UAWKS works for you, by all means use it! Use the following script in AutoHotKey only if you're not using UAWKS.+F3::Send {PRINTSCREEN}return+F4::Send {CTRL DOWN} {SHIFT DOWN} {ESC} {CTRL UP} {SHIFT UP}return+F10::Send {VOLUME_MUTE}return+F11::Send {VOLUME_DOWN}return+F12::Send {VOLUME_UP}return!left::send {HOME}return!right::send {END}return!up::send {PGUP}return!down::send {PGDN}return!backspace::Send {DEL}returnShift-F3 sends the printscreen command, Shift-F4 sends the ctrl-alt-del keystroke combination to bring up the Task Manager (Alternatively, you can use ctrl-shift-esc),  shift-F10 sends the mute command, and so on. Similarly, alt-&lt;left arrow> sends the Home command, alt-&lt;up arrow> sends the Page Up command, alt-&lt;delete/backspace> sends the forward delete command, and so on. You can customize the script to suit your needs. Remember to save the script, right-click on the "H" icon in the tray area, and select "Reload This Script."That's it! Hope it helps.---The Apple keyboard is ergonomic and aesthetically pleasing and has a quality construction and rock-solid connectivity. *HIGHLY* recommended.

There is no definite snap when inserting a card, I suspect that this is the cause of losing connection to the card at random intervals. Unfortunately, this could result is data corruption.The internal pins need to be improved for sure.

I do not have a single bad thing to say about it. All the different functions and angles are great! I wish they had one for my phone like this. Now if you are looking for a slim and lightweight case, that isn't going to protect it if you drop your mini, than this case isn't for you. It adds bulk and weight but will save your $300 or more mini.

$review_text.: After trying the Surface Pro and finding the 10.6" screen too small and the battery life lacking, I decided to try the Acer W700P-6821.I've heard people say that 1" isn't the big of a deal.  Well, I totally disagree.  As someone who was looking for a machine I could bring to work to do .NET development on, I found the Surface Pro to be just a tad too small.  Fortunately the Acer has an extra inch and to me, it makes a world of difference.  Software development is much easier on the Acer.The tablet is solid.  I have never had a problem with a bigger tablet.  This one is fairly big and weighs 2 lbs.  The screen is nice and bright with bright colors.The dock isn't as bad as reviews have alluded to.  It is made of textured plastic.  I think it looks quite nice on my desk.  Unfortunately I wanted to use this as a laptop replacement, and that's when this tablet starts falling short.The keyboard case it comes with does not have a track pad.  So what this means is that couch use is fairly limited, especially in desktop mode.  I didn't think this would be too much of a problem until I tried to use my budgeting software using my finger.  Desktop mode is fairly difficult to use with touch only.  Instinctively, I kept trying to place my finger on a non-existent touch pad.  Frustrating.  There's no way I'm going to be using Visual Studio on this while sitting on the couch.This hybrid is obviously for people who intend to use it as a PC on their desk and not as a laptop replacement.  If only Acer could have included a track-pad on their keyboard case, I would definitely keep it.  Unfortunately it looks like I'll have to save up for the Lenovo Thinkpad Helix if I want a hybrid PC that doesn't require me to compromise.

$review_text.: I just purchased this as a replacement from my Sony P-72 3.2 meg camera


 WOW!  This camera is so much more improved from only a couple years ago
 Aside from the 5.1 megapixel count, this camera excels in almost every conceivable area relevant to compacts.First off, this camera starts up in less than a second or so--truly fast compared to other similarly priced cameras


 This feature is essential when attempting to capture that oh so special kodak...er...sony moment in a blink.Secondly, the camera is beautiful


 Sony got it right this time when designing a sturdy, compact and lightweight technological masterpiece


 True, it's not as small as its even lighter cousin--the T-1, or the Pentax Optio S4i and Casio Ex-z4, but it passes the pants pocket test with flying colors

Additionally, when compared to the T-1, this camera uses the regular memory stick size and not the smaller duo like the T-1


Sooooo, if you already own a sony, this is a natural upgrade.Some other excellent features on the P-100 are the manual overides


 You can adjust the shutter speed and aperature which, for a camera in this class, is a true rarity.Unlike the T-1, this cam does have a tripod mount, a no brainer for any serious photographer

 I also am enjoying the extremely high quality video mode; although not the most important selling point, having the ability to take camcorder like videos with sound for unlimited amounts of time (unlike 30 second segments from many other cams) is handy.Another amazing feature is the battery life

 I remember my first sony digital camera--the DSC-P50 2.1 mega pixel

 It's battery life was dismal


 My P-72 was slightly improved, but still suffered from chronic battery munchies


 The P-100 fully charged can take pictures for over 200 minutes!  If you're on the display modes, it can last almost double that--another breathtaking accomplishment

 The info lithium works well in calculating the remaining battery life--a major complaint from owners of other cameras like Canon that lack this feature
 Lastly, it is a proprietary battery, so purchasing an additional one is recommended.Needless to say, the 1.8&quot; lcd is gorgeous, just like the past sony cameras I've had

 It's extremely hi-res and I have no difficulty seeing it in sunlight

 The lcd's navigation is similar to earlier sony cams with a few new additions like a light metering box.Overall, I'm tremendously pleased with the picture quality from this puppy
 I envision this camera lasting well into early-mid 2005 when Sony will release yet another improvement
 Until then, I highly recommend this for most anybody who appreciates quality and functionality incorporated into a lightweight package.

$review_text.: This replaced my old Microsoft Trackball, which was great, but is no longer made, and I don't want to pay several hundred dollars for a replacement. (Are you listening, Microsoft?) The ball is not as large.However, the design, once you get used to it, is quite clever. The USB adapter stores inside the battery compartment. It has a switch on the back to turn power off when you are not using it. Battery replacement is easy and it seems to be a miser on power use. I liked it enough to buy a second for my laptop bag, because it is so much better than a touchpad.In conclusion, I think that if you do &#34;advanced&#34; photo editing or real CADCAM, the old Microsoft Trackball with its larger ball is superior. Otherwise, for convenience and portability, this is another very fine Logitech product.Plug 'n' play - AForm, fit and quality - AReliability - AEase of Use - B
$SUMMARY.: Very nice trackball, all things considered

$REVIEW.: The one feature I really really like with the Gmax 67S helmet is the optional flashing light (or brake light if you hook it up)  When you are up at eye level the light from the rear of the helmet will be seen.  Would be nice if you could make it a flashing brake light though.When I ordered the brake light kit I also ordered the battery pack.  Found when I got the brake light kit the battery pack was included.  Do not buy the extra battery pack.  I tried to get answers from the sellers of the brake light kit before I ordered if it came with the battery pack but never got replies.Install is easy but instructions with it are pretty poor. I used a youtube video and it was very helpful.

$review_text.: Sources: iPhone5 with Portaphile Micro/PA2V2/Decware Zen Head amps using the LOD, various computers using Microstreamer/Beyer A200p/v-moda Verza DAC/amps.Review notes: My first impressions of the sound of the T1 'Tesla' headphone are based on direct comparisons to other headphones - the v-moda M80 and M100, the Beyerdynamic T90, DT1350 and T51p, the FAD Pandora IV and VI, and notes I've accumulated from many prior reviews


I describe how I relate to the T1 (i.e


my personal tastes and how I use the headphone) only after covering all of the objective issues.Summary of sound: Extremely smooth from the deep bass up through the mid-treble
The upper treble (7-10 khz) is a little strong for me, and you can see the EQ adjustments I made with the Audioforge Equalizer (link above, or found at my dalethorn site under Photos and Audioforge) to smooth out the strongest frequencies

I also boost the low bass around 40 hz slightly, but that's not because it's not neutral or otherwise ideal - that boost is just a personal preference for a warmer sound

The T1 has enough reserve for such things so as long as you don't push it too far, you won't incur any distortion or muddiness from a modest boost

I hear nothing but clean clear detail in the T1 bass

The T1 midrange is phenomenal - a liquid-like sound that impresses me more than any other headphone I've had, including my 3 years with the Sennheiser HD800.The T1 treble may be perfect for musical genres such as classical, acoustic, jazz and so on, or for some users who know that they prefer the stronger high end that this headphone was designed for

Whether you like the sound as-is or make minor adjustments as I did, the overall result (in my opinion) probably can't be beat at the full retail price, although there are competitors for certain aspects of the sound in that price range

I've heard some planars that have a very compelling bass response, but I prefer the T1 bass since it doesn't exert dominance over any other part of the spectrum
I've heard other headphones such as the Shure SRH1840 where the treble quantity is closer to what I prefer, but none of those are balanced just right throughout the treble (never minding the rest of their sound spectrum), so the T1 holds its own there.The final judgement of course is in playing my most demanding music tracks, such as David Chesky and Wonjung Kim's &#34;Girl From Guatemala&#34;, and the T1 delineates the extreme treble percussion after 3 minutes into that track perfectly

The T1 soundstage is just right, and where I might say &#34;excellent&#34; or &#34;very good&#34; for other premium headphones (as applicable), &#34;just right&#34; seems like the proper description when the soundstage sounds completely natural with no artificial enhancement

This is particularly interesting given that the T1's drivers are sharply angled and offset significantly from the center of the earcups


My T90 headphone (with the tweaks I applied to it) has a great soundstage, and the T1 was very similar when I compared them


But beyond that similarity, the T1 has a somewhat better depth and sense of realism, and if it turns out that that's due to the angled/offset drivers, count me as surprised and impressed.The T1 fit is perfect for me, with big earpads that should surround the largest ears in full comfort


The headband clamp is light, particularly so for a full-size headphone
The earpad edges may feel a little stiff on first use, but they are soft and spongy, so adjusting to the feel should take only a few seconds

The headband adjustment goes about one inch smaller on each side from where I use it to about 3/4 inch larger on each side, and that should accomodate a very wide range of sizes based on my average-size head
The dual-entry cable is fairly thick and very long (~10-12 feet), and terminated by a 6.5 mm (1/4 inch) Neutrik plug


The T1 is an open-back design, so there's almost no isolation

Leakage is such that you won't be able to play this headphone in a quiet office or public library without disturbing persons close by.The T1's efficiency or sensitivity is fairly low and requires power well beyond what most cellphones or pocket music players can provide

The small portable amps that I typically use have to be set to high gain to drive the T1 to adequate volume for most of my music tracks
But I don't recommend having &#34;just enough&#34; power for this headphone, since &#34;soft clipping&#34; can occur with some amps, and you could find yourself a couple of hours into a listening session just to discover that the subtle edginess you thought was in the music is actually clipping.The comments in the music tracks listed below can be compared to other headphone reviews I've done, to get an idea of how the T1 plays the different music tracks listed here compared to other headphones


My suggestion is instead of reading each comment below as an absolute unto itself, you could compare these notes to other reviews as they get posted, and see how the T1 compares with each individual track.Animotion - Obsession (1980's New Wave/Techno): The upper bass synth has excellent detail and tone with a modest weight, and both male and female vocals sound natural without favoring either


The T1 plays this extremely well.Bauhaus - Bela Lugosi's Dead (~1980): Strong midrange sound effects - this is a good worst-case test for resonant-type sounds in the most sensitive midrange area


Handled perfectly by the T1.Beethoven Symphony 9, Solti/CSO (1972): Excellent overall sound
Of special note here are the bass impacts beginning around 10:30 of the fourth movement
Those impacts are soft and well in the background, but you can feel some of the weight they carry with the T1.Black Sabbath - Iron Man (Classic Rock): Very good instrumental detail and the vocal sounds very natural
As with most classic rock tracks, there is very little or no deep bass


The T1 plays this music smoothly, and the lack of deep bass doesn't unbalance the treble.Boz Scaggs - Lowdown (1976): Good sound quality - this is a great test for any nasality in the midrange


Handled extremely well by the T1.Cantus - Danny Boy (Traditional/Male Choral/Acapella): The T1 plays the voices with enough low end warmth and weight to sound very natural, yet there is no added emphasis of the lower register of the male voices on this track.Cath Carroll - Moves Like You (1980's New Wave/Techno): This track's percussion and voice are crisp and well-balanced, and there's a good sense of space or soundstage around the voices and instruments
The T1 reproduces the space and detail beautifully.Catherine Wheel - Black Metallic (~1991): Goth with industrial overtones - I like this since it's a great music composition and the sound effects are smoothly integrated into the mix


This may sound distorted or mushy with some headphones, but the T1 renders the deliberate instrumental distortions clearly.Chris Isaak - Wicked Game (Pop/Rock): The T1 plays this high treble energy recording very smoothly - the voice and instruments are very detailed but not edgy - very musical in fact.Chromatics - I'm On Fire (Synth-Pop, female lead): This track has a good amount of space around the voice and instruments, making for a very pleasant stereo image

The voice is excellent, and the tambourine sound is as realistic as I've heard with any other headphone since doing these detailed reviews.David Hazeltine - Fur Elise (Jazz): A very high-quality recording from HDTracks

The T1 reproduces the instruments smoothly with a spacious ambiance


The wire-brush-on-cymbal harmonics are very extended and detailed.Grieg (Beecham-Royal Philharmonic) - Peer Gynt-Solveig's Lullaby (Classical): This very old (late 1950's) stereo recording must have been made on the most expensive gear in the world, since the overall sound quality and especially Ilse Hollweg's amazing voice are as close to &#34;being there&#34; as I've heard with some of the better classical recordings made since the year 2000
The T1 plays this music perfectly.Hans Zimmer - Dark Knight-Aggressive Expansion (Soundtrack): The percussion in this track hits really hard, and the bass tones beginning around 0:45 *should* have the ultra-deep &#34;shuddery&#34; kind of sound and feel that indicates a good deep-bass response, but the T1 is somewhat light on bass impact here
Still, the T1 plays this music very well overall.Heaven 17 - Let Me Go (1980's New Wave/Techno): The bass instrument (guitar?) has excellent detail, and the voices and ambiance have a &#34;you are there&#34; quality that's uncommon in early 1980's pop music
The T1 plays this track perfectly.Hugo Audiophile - 15-16 (Electronic): I'm not sure what the 15-16 stands for - perhaps track numbers from a CD album

The deep-bass tones that start around 33-34 seconds into the track reproduce fairly well with the T1
This is a great recording for evaluating whether a headphone's bass will be sufficient for most environments, since for many headphones that have a weaker bass, the deep bass gets absorbed and mostly lost when the environment contains a lot of low-frequency energy.Human League - Keep Feeling Fascination (1980's New Wave/Techno): This track's bass line is very detailed, but the somewhat forward voices don't have quite the &#34;you are there&#34; quality of the Heaven 17 track noted above.Jimmy Smith - Basin Street Blues (early 60's): This track has several loud crescendos of brass and other instruments that don't sound clean and musical with some headphones


The T1 provides excellent detail
Listen particularly to the second crescendo at 15 seconds in for maximum detail effect

I'd like to emphasize that these crescendos are probably the worst-case test I have for instrument separation and detail, and the T1 does those very well.Kellogg Auditorium, Battle Creek Michigan, Aeolian-Skinner Organ (1933) - Pedal, 32', Resultant, Arpeggio: This 16 hz organ pedal tone differs from other music tones in that you won't &#34;hear&#34; the tone - you'll only feel it


Although most music tones have harmonics (including this one), the harmonics from this tone will be too weak to provide any &#34;feel&#34;, so whatever you actually hear would not be part of the fundamental 16 hz tone

There are ~30 hz sounds in the outdoor environment in big cities, generated by large trucks, buses, and subway trains, and they have a quality of &#34;rumble&#34; that's similar to some deep-bass tones found in music


This 16 hz organ tone is easily distinguished from those sounds when compared on a headphone that has good undistorted response at 16 hz
The T1 reproduces the fundamental tone with a light weight.Mantovani - Sunrise Sunset (Easy Listening, ca
1972): A master musician and conductor who specialized in light classics and orchestral pop music, Mantovani's accomplishments were overshadowed by music critics who couldn't tolerate the notion of &#34;light classics&#34; or &#34;semi-classical&#34; music, even when those recordings were no threat to the classical music genres
In any case the later Mantovani recordings from the mid-1960's through mid-1970's had the advantage of being mixed for much better hi-fi systems than those which the music critics possessed at the start of the Long Playing (LP) record cycle


Here in 2014, at least some of those digital remasters have improved the sound further, although it's not always the case


This track as played on the T1 is a perfect example of the sheer musicality lurking in those later recordings, and is highly recommended for soundstage, instrumental tone, and musical balance.Michael Tilson Thomas - Rhapsody In Blue (20th Century Classic): Great sound and soundstage, and terrific piano playing and tone


There are some very deep bass impacts starting around 38 seconds into the 17:24 length track, and the weight of those impacts is fairly subtle with the T1.Porcupine Tree - Trains (Pop-Rock): This track opens with some nicely-detailed string sounds and a forward-sounding male voice with a higher-than-average register


There are a series of &#34;clip-clop&#34; effects starting at 3:19 that should sound like they were made with wooden blocks of some kind
The T1 reproduces those sound effects with a subdued &#34;clop&#34;.Richard Strauss (Mester-Pasadena) - Also Sprach Zarathustra (opening) (Classical): The granddaddy of bass is in the opening 1:50 of this recording, and I've heard it only once on a large and expensive loudspeaker system in Cleveland
For most people, that experience would be indistinguishable from being in a fairly strong earthquake
The T1 provides some of that experience, but the lean low bass lessens the realism

The tympani have good impact here.Scarlatti-Kipnis - Sonata in E Major K381 (Classical, Harpsichord): The harpsichord here is fairly bright and highly detailed, and the T1 renders the tones and transients perfectly.Trombone Shorty - Backatown (Jazz-Funk): The deep bass impacts here aren't as strong as with most headphones, but they blend well with the horns and other instruments
The T1 delivers the impacts with fair weight and excellent detail, and the horns have the kind of bite that gives them a wonderfully realistic sound.William Orbit - Optical Illusion (Billy Buttons Mix) (Electronic): This is about as close as I want to get to easy-listening music
The string tones beginning at 0:18 are fairly soft, and while the bass isn't very deep, it still adds a good underpinning to the music


The short poetic rap at 4:14, preceded by an etherial female voice, works very well with this track.

$REVIEW.: This keyboard would be perfect if it worked with logitechs setpoint software. I don't know what happened when they put out this keyboard.Not having setpoint for the keyboard makes things more tricky you don't get the popup notifications in windows telling you what button you just hit, (num lock caps lock email home etc) there's no battery indicator no sort of indicator at all for anything really. your guessing if the caps lock is on or num lock is off. If you are looking for a wireless keyboard skip this one it's terrible. I had the mk300 version of this keyboard before, but I decided to update to this one due to the fact that the mk300 only had 48-bit encryption (very weak!) The security upgrade to 128-bit AES is awesome, but not at the lack of features/interest on logictechs part for this keyboard.

$review_text.: This photo backback compares favorably to the Lowepro MiniTrekker yet it's less than half the cost! Sure, it's not *quite* as well built and the chest and waist straps and clips aren't as tough as on the Lowepro, but for the price it can't be beat. You won't really gain any more functionality by spending over twice as much on the Lowepro, although you will gain a bag that will probably last a few more years. Note also that wile the Lowepro is slightly taller (which is nice), it's also a lot thicker (12" vs. this Canon's 7"). This means the Lowepro looks you look like a spaceperson while you are wearing it yet this Canon backpack holds nearly the same amount of stuff and looks a bit better (although I do wish it was slightly longer since I'm a bit tall it would be nice if this pack came down a bit lower on my back.Note the online pictures of this pack do not do it justice, the color is really a nice dark olive drab and black, (it's not gold or anything). While I do wish it had grey/black or just all black coloring instead of the olive, it is not offensive looking or anything as is. Like others, I do not like the Canon logo on it but that's something that a bit of black gaffer's tape can take care of with ease.A note about the layout-I like this style photo backpack better than the type where the camera gear is placed in the bottom of the pack and the top part is for other items. This style is more space efficient-it can hold more lenses and photo gear in the main compartment, yet the outside dimensions of the bag are less. Granted, you do have to take the pack off and set it down to access it. But I tried a Tamrac backpack  (the kind where the camera stuff goes in the bottom part of the pack) before buying this Canon and I found it way too big and not any more convenient to use as I had to also remove that one from my back to access it. In the end, this Canon holds extra stuff too. In the flap pocket, I can fit a shirt, light lunch and other items like a magazine. In fact, I can even fit a small laptop in the main compartment (in a separate laptop slipcase for protection). I would say a 13"-15" laptop would fit fine, but not a 17" or larger one.If you want something that you can work out of without having to take it off and yet carries all of your photo gear, I doubt you will ever find it. I would instead recommend a shoulder bag that you carry only one or two lenses in (for weight reasons) for walking around with, and a back pack for transporting all your stuff. I also use the backpack for long walks/hikes and it works fine not fully loaded too. In other words, just because you can take every single photo item you own, doesn't meanyou have to or should.This photo backpack is money well spent. Sure, if you can find the Lowepro for the same price, snag that instead since the materials in the Lowepro are sturdier and better made. But at this price, I can absolutely recommend the Canon 200EG Photo back pack, it's a no brainer!

$REVIEW.: I bought one of these devices a couple years ago when migrating from my iPhone 3 to my iPhone 4.  I have an aftermarket iPod control unit attached to my Chevy Suburban's factory head unit.  This device doesn't interfere with the function of that integration cable at all, other than doing what is promised: allowing you to charge the iPhone 4/4s using the older iPod interface.  This is my second purchase of the same item and the durability could stand some improvement, but for the price, I think 2 years of heavy use for something that gets banged around in the car all day is pretty good.  My first one still works, but the inside "board" has come loose and you have to often shake it to get it to work.

$REVIEW.: This bag is for 16 inch laptops, but I found it a little on the small side even for my 16 inch laptop - it's a tight fit for all the necessary computer supplies. Aside from that, it has many great features including a nicely padded middle compartment, adjustable shoulder straps, and carrying handle. Another great feature was the two extra small compartments, which can fit small document folders, pencils, a computer mouse, flashdrive,and more. The water bottle pockets are convenient also for being on the go at school or at work. The zippers are high quality and don't go off track like so many other cheap bags. Plus, the polyester material is thick and well-made. I would recommend this for anyone looking for just the basics out of a laptop bag.

$REVIEW.: I gave the mouse a couple of hours of use but I couldn't find a comfortable position for my hand. I found myself holding it all different ways but never found a comfort zone. It is also extremely light which would take some getting used to, I found the pointer to be much more jerky even on the lowest DPI setting than I was accustomed to (I don't mean scroll speed, literally jerky looking). I had to return the mouse because my unit came with a sticky scroll wheel click. I use the middle click extensively and this was not acceptable. I found the scroll wheel to be flimsy, almost as if it should have side scrolling capabilities. Other than that, the mouse seemed of decent construction.*update*Anker contacted me directly by phone after I wrote this review. They wanted to send me another mouse to spend some more time with it and see if I might be satisfied with a working product. You may be thinking, as was I, that they wanted to bribe me for a better review. I told the CSR that I was going to add a star just for the good customer service, but he insisted I not do that. I believe fully that he did not want me to change my review of the product if I still felt it was inadequate. The new mouse has a perfect middle click and I have become very comfortable with it. I feel that it is a great value for the $10 selling price. My only nit pick at this point is that the mouse is very light and I like to have a little more weight in my hand. But it is my current mouse that I use all day and it works great. I have amended my review from 2 to 4 stars for customer service and value.

$review_text.: OK.  I'm one of those who like many used windows based pc's and notebooks for years.  Due for an upgrade on my notebook, i decided to give the new macbook a look.  I'm glad i made that choice!!  this machine absolutely is worth the $1,100 price tag.  the new mac os x leopard blows away windows vista.  The macbook is very user friendly and easy to use. some of the features this machine has will take Microsoft 10 years to develop and implement on their machines.  The iLife suit can is included with this machine, which includes iphoto, iweb, imovie, and garage band (don't use that much).  Safari web browser is second to none.  Explorer always gave a distorted, over the top look and feel when surfing the web.  Safari shows exactly what you need, with very easy configuring if necessary.  I consider myself to have moderate computer wisdom, it didn't take me long at all to figure out and operate a mac.  Within 2 days of exploring its layout, I was rolling with it.  Overall great product, if you still use window pc's like me at work or at home, mac virtually converts everything, so their should be little difficulty adjusting.  Some improvements I would like to see apple make are boosting up the gigs on this thing.  At this point 120 and up should be the standard.  Also, .Mac, although a very good user interface and emailing setup, is a little expensive.  It should come down to about $50 annually.Update: macbook (entry level white) just upgraded to 120 gigs and a 2.1ghz processor.  If it's in your budget, check out the macbook pro, apple's best!!

$review_text.: 100 gb in drive C:\ and 122 gb in drive D:\ is what i showed in windows 7. ubuntu disk partitioner said 10gb reserved for vista loader for some reason.8 hours battery 100% cpu, 6:30min using wifi, 10 maybe if not doing anything, 12 hours if the lid is closed and its idle. Battery came at like 50% charged.Speed is very decent. Used with windows 7 for awhile and everything worked well, startup was fast. Not too much bloat. If you don't want office do yourself a favor and uninstall it first because windows update has an infinite number of office 07 updates. In ubuntu there's brightness control issues and the wifi drops too often, but there's several  solutions offered online that worked. Keyboard and mouse might not work on ubuntu installation, but they do if it's running just on battery. Netbook remix kind of pointless though as this is plenty fast. Just autohide the panels for more room.The glossy screen is much more exhausting than my previous matte screen from my previous asus laptop even after setting it to lowest brightness. It's hard to go long hours on it. 1024 x 768 would have been nice, many programs aren't really designed for 600px height anymore.

$review_text.: I called my local camera store - only independent left in the area so I was hoping to toss them some business. I had just purchased a used camera and the sensor was dirty. So, I asked, how much for a clean and how long does it take? The answer was $100 and 2 days or they could send it out and get it back a week later for $69.95. No thanks. Ordered this for $20, enough swabs for 4 cleanings. Blew the dust out with my rocket blower, ran the swab over the sensor and back and done. Less than 5 minutes and it turned out fine. Just be sure you have the correct size swab for your particular sensor.

I received mine today and just tested it out and I and quite happy with the sound quality from the little speakers

The only reason I am giving this product 4 our of 5 stars is because the case feels pretty flimsy


The top hinge on mine isn't secured to the back (I don't know if it is supposed to be or not) and it seems like it would pop right off it dropped just right, but like I said I bought this more for the speakers than the case and I am pretty happy so far.

$REVIEW.: I bought this air cooler to cool my i7-3770K. Here is what I have to say about it,Pro* Very well packaged. AMD and Intel mounting bracket are placed in separate boxes. Instruction manual is very through with installation.* Mounting hardware is very firm. Does not feel cheap.* Superb cooling performance for its price. This air cooler can easily match its older brother, NH-D14. Out of all the cooler I have used only Swiftech H220 can beat this cooler by 7 Celsius degree.* Comes with mounting hardware if you want to install a second fan.* Fan is silent even at full speed. Beside the sound of airflow there is no vibration sound at all.* Comes with 6 years warranty, longest I have seen.Con* This air cooler is very wide. Be advise it can block the first expansion slot (so GPU or long PCIe x1 card needs to be moved). Can be a problem if you are doing SLI/CF or using mATX/Mini ITX board.* This air cooler is also very tall. Some budget cases are incompatible with this air cooler.Overall score: 5/5For its price, this is a top notch air cooler.

$review_text.: As of the year 2010, the majority of new electronics that handle audio/visual content now come with the ability to connect to the internet... HDTVs, Blu-Ray and DVD players, receivers, etc. And, the majority of those now seem to come with the built in ability to connect via its own wireless network connection. But, since we don't all have the ability to upgrade everything because of convenience, the Netgear WNCE2001 Universal WiFi Internet Adapter provides the easy to setup tool to connect all of your devices to the internet without having to string Cat5 cables throughout your home or office.The Netgear WNCE2001 Universal WiFi Internet Adapter does exactly what it says it does... it connects an internet ready device (with an Ethernet port) to your wireless router; and if your device has a powered USB port, this adapter can be powered by the device as well.Overall, the setup was fairly straight forward, but I did run into a few hiccups before I got a connection established... mostly not associated with the adapter itself, but with a device like this, it is difficult to get feedback from it when something isn't working properly. I highly recommend this internet adapter for all of your legacy connection needs.

$REVIEW.: I was one of the unfortunate people who bought the Startech 6-port USB card.  It immediately began crashing my computer, and leaving ghost devices in my system.  I eventually had to reinstall windows because of that card.  I emailed the company to complain and was given an RMA for the PCI420USB.  Sure, I lose 1 internal port, but I didn't really need them anyway.The card arrived yesterday and I installed it last night.  So far I've been able to plug in my Ipod without any trouble, and have a game controller running through a hub without any conflicts.  This isn't a name brand, but the company did follow through, and so far I'm happy with this card.

$REVIEW.: [EDITED April 2013.  They just pushed a new Netflix "app" and it's absolutely terrible.  I wish Amazon would allow me to subtract stars when editing. These LG guys are wasting my precious time like it's candy. Forced automatic updates, too, nothing you can do when they have a bad idea]This is a device with a lot of functionality. It is very difficult to decide whether to praise it for being so rich in different things it can do or bash it for doing them incompletely.  So I held back with the review until I used it more.Unfortunately I still have to rate the experience as insatisfactory and my TV rack is not where it should be. I have not been able to really let go of "real PCs".I won't go through the number of features again, I am just listing the things that are supposed to work and don't quite.No Amazon prime video. Why? Come on, who is dropping the ball here? I don't subtract points for this since it might be Amazon to blame but somebody needs to get cracking.Network functionality: LG doesn't document clearly what kind of network protocols it reads under what circumstances. It just tosses a CD with some software your way and expects you to run it. Sorry that's not the way I do it.  I expect standard protocols to be used and documentation on which parts are supported.  I could not make SMB network drives work at all, although I copy and pasted all kinds of supposed working things from the 'net.  I can only assume that my particular player with my particular firmware has no SMB functionality. The reason why this makes my angry is not that the functionality is lacking. It is LG's non-communication on the issue.UPnP kinda works, except when it magically does not, and then it just displays a rotating wait circle til the end of time. I have seen a lot of that.Speaking of it, there are no error messages or any other kind of diagnostics, ever.  It's not just that the only error message is "didn't work" like you see often. In this case there isn't even a "doesn't work". It just greyed out stuff or endless hourglasses.The display of filenames on USB sticks is braindead, it cuts off after a couple characters so that you can't tell the filenames from each other. After 5 seconds (why the delay) it slowly scrolls sideways at an annoying slow speed. I had to go back to 1983 8+3 MS-DOS filenames.  Not cool.  Yes, I use the USB stick a lot since the network things are so unreliable.Although it has good ability to remember where you left off watching, including tracking whole series/seasons on Blu Ray, I also had a high number of cases where it tossed the information where I was.  It seems that watching something else in between destroys play status easily. My old $30 Philips DVD player would never do that, I can probably pull it out the attick in 2058 and it knows where I left off.Thingie is not able to play DVD other than from the disk. It can neither read DVD disk image files from USB or network, not can it deal with the whole directory structure presented on USB or the network.  My PC-based players all do that fine. In practice that means you have to convert to a plain mpeg file to watch if you have an archive on disk. Or in other words, you lose all menus and extras from the disk.Netflix access has two software packages in this thing, one works, one doesn't (prevents code not recognized by Netflix).The biggest single disappointment is using your cellphone or tablet as a remote.  What I really wanted is to use a better "keyboard" than just up and down keys to enter characters when searching youtube or netflix.  Sadly no support for bluetooth keyboards is in here, but they do allow you to use your cellphone or tablet as a remote - which have acceptable keyboard. And you know what they do - they only use the tablet for up and down and the other keys already on the remote.  They do not provide a single extra button, and there is *no* use of the touchpad for entering text.  Plus the Android software doesn't work at all for me, although the IOS version did work. Useless. But works.As I said, lots of functionality but ultimately disappointing. My PC does all of the above fine.

$REVIEW.: A stylus for your tablet or phone is such a thing of personal taste and preference, that to review one is like telling someone what you think of a certain brand of coffee.  What I think is delicious, you might think tastes like battery acid.  That said, I've tested a LOT of different stylus and discovered there's a trade-off with every one.  The Kensington has come closest to what I was looking for.First of all is the feel of the weight in my hand.  Other stylus tend to be a little too light, and don't give you the kind of control you need if you're going to draw fine-lined illustrations.  Other stylus' rubber nubs are too fat or squishy, and couldn't give you a thin line no matter how you set the settings on your tablet.  I was surprised that the Kensington delivered a nice thin line and gave me a lot of control when writing words, or creating illustrations. Maybe that's the &#34;virtuoso&#34; part of the name.The stylus also has a ball-point pen on the other end that takes Parker refills, which is fine, but I find it to be a bit stubby as a pen, since the size of the unit was really designed for stylus use.  I'm not sure I'll ever use the pen.  There's nothing special about the pen itself, but you might find it handy.If there's any downside, it's the price. At $25 I think it's overpriced although, if you've searched far and wide for a good stylus, you'd probably be willing to pay it for a stylus like this that gives great control and the ability to truly draw thin lines if you want them.

$review_text.: Step Up/Down transformers are tricky devices.  It's not hard to see why so many users gave negative reviews.But in order to use a converter without any problems, you need to be mindful of 2 things:1) The required current (in terms of ampere rating) of the device that you are powering.2) Whether the device is motorized.If you are using a transformer/converter such as this one for a battery charger or cell phone charger, then you shouldn't run into any overheating or shutdown issues.  But if you are using it for a hairdryer or another device with heavy moving parts (like an old tape recorder that uses 3 motors), then you need to pay special attention to #1 and ensure that the wattage rating of the transformer/converter is actually 20 to 30 watts greater than the motorized device's rated power consumption.These are the precautions I took and it worked perfectly for me.

$REVIEW.: Bellows for macro photography used to be sold by every major camera manufacturer. Double-release cables were used to control the lens' aperture. Some companies sold two models concurrently; bellows with tilt and shift, and bellows without.The Fotodiox offering, a made-in-China unit sold by various vendors under various names, is a low-precision bellows without tilt or shift. You won't be able to reliably reproduce the same shot over and over, say for scientific research purposes. That said, if you're a hobbyist and your subject is willing to sit still for a while, then you can use this bellows to take bigger-than-life shots. To give you an idea, I managed to fill my screen with the center oval of my fingerprint.Incidentally, some reviews complained about the stench given off by the adhesive used to make the bellows. Mine doesn't smell too bad.

$review_text.: When you first wonder what you are missing by listening to you music with those ear buds that came with your iPod, you can find yourself on a rewarding (and expensive)journey


I knew that the iPod earbuds were seriously lacking, many songs had muddled bass and highs.My journey to find the perfect headphones started with theAudio-Technica Airtight Dynamic Monitor Stereo Headphones, an improvement over my iPod buds but very uncomfortable

My next leap was theAudio Technica ATH-A700 Closed-Back Dynamic Headphones With Double Air Dampingand they are really a wonderful headset

The are a closed headset, and I wanted to hear an open one so I got the much touted for rock listening, Grado SR80 Headphones which for awhile became my favorites


I am using all these cans with my Toshiba laptop and iTunes, mostly high vbr mp3s
For my iPod I am using both theSennheiser PX 100 Collapsible HeadphonesandYuin Pk2 Earphonesboth of which blow iBuds out of the water.But once you start down this path, you seem to always want more
I had read many reviews on headfi.org and one had stated that the HFI-780 had good bass and were probably the best cans under $350, a pretty bold statement

I decided to take the plunge and they now are my favorites


I use them with myToshiba Satellite X205-S9349 17-inch Laptop (Intel Core 2 Duo Processor T7100, 2 GB RAM, 240 GB Hard DRive, HD SuperMulti DVD Drive, Vista Premium),Audio Advantage Micro USB Sound Card, and a portable headphone amp (Little Micro Dot +) and this setup has the most full, crip sound I have yet to hear from any source

The lows are more defined and substantial then the Grados

The surround gives music more of a feeling that the music is being played live all around you, and you can pick out where instruments are being played.When you upgrade to a headphone this good, there are some things you need to realize

First, there is a break-in period

Some like to use "pink noise" over a period of time


But no matter what you do, your headphones will sound different over time, usually for the better


You may also need to experiment with your setup
I initially was just playing out of the laptop jack, using the on board sound card

The Ultrasone's did not sound good with that setup, bass was not well defined, there was a hiss in the background and the music was not full

Using the Turtle Audio to process the sound removes the processing from the EM interference within the laptop that can cause distortion


The amp added fullness, I have the computer's volume to the max and adjust it with the amp's volume switch


Next, higher end headphones can amplify bad music sources

mp3s can have a whooshing noise in the background because mp3's are a compromise between file size and quality, so try and use higher vbr mp3's

And once you really hear what you are missing in your music, you know that these headphones really are worth the cost.EDIT: For those that do not like the pleather pads, the velour pads for theBeyerdynamic DT 250 - Headphones ( ear-cup )which can be found online will fit it nicely
There is a metal band under the plastic cover on top that can be bent for those complaining of a too snug a fit.EDIT 4/2011  Just under 2 years and they are still going strong

Clarity, strong base, large sound stage, these cans just seem to sound better and better


Amazon carries theBeyerdynamic EDT 200 Velour Padded Earcushions for DT250, DT280, Sony MDR7506 and V6 Headphones (Pair)now and they are cheaper then anywhere else since they are Prime eligible


I don't think Ultrasone makes this model anymore so grab a pair while you can!


$SUMMARY.: My Best "Cans"!

$review_text.: I wanted some front speakers for my boat but didn't want to invest a lot of money.  These BIC indoor/outdoor speakers were a perfect fit in the little cubby area on each side of the bow and they sound much more expensive than they are.  I have some Polk DB 651 marine speakers in the back which are very nice and the BIC's can definitely hold their own with the Polks. I couldn't ask for nicer speakers for the less than $25 (shipped) that I paid.

$REVIEW.: The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is that the zippered pouch in the front strikes me as rather useless for storing anything beyond a SD card.  I was able to stuff the HDMI cable in but it was a tight fit and that isn't really what I would have liked to have been able to store.  On the other hand, this clearly is not designed to be a sizeable storage bag for the camcorder and accessories.  And perhaps making this larger would have made the case bulky and defeated it's purpose.On the other hand, it's perfect for protecting your camcorder with minimum bulk and it certainly is hard to take issue with the price.  I does appear to be very well made and my Sony HDR-CX290 fits perfectly with larger NP-FV70 installed.  I don't believe a larger battery on the camcorder would fit.  The total length of the camcorder with the NP-FV70 battery installed is a hair under 5.5 inches so use that as a guide if you are thinking about ordering this case.

$review_text.: Purchased the first in April but the controls on the front of the TV were inoperative. Contacted Amazon who had me contact Samsung who had me contact a local television repair shop. The shop and Samsung tech support didn't know anything about this new model so I contacted Amazon to have the unit replaced. The new TV was delivered in about a week, the defective unit picked up and about two weeks later Amazon received the return. The TV I have now is great. The only improvement, I want the ability to assign labels to my preferred channels which is not available in cable mode. Other than that, the picture is superb but the speakers are very tinny and cheap. Added some externals and I'm happy. I appreciate Amazon's customer service and recommend this unit.

$REVIEW.: All I needed was a couple of extra USB ports, and this one was 3-4 times lower in price than the comparable D-Link.  It performs as well, I'm sure, but it's very light and small.  With a shorty cable that neatly packs away into the back of the device, it's ideal for storing in a laptop case.  Using it with my desktop, I've had to settle for having it hang somewhat indecorously on the back of my computer--a side no one sees, so no big deal.  Nevertheless, a longer cord would enable it to rest on the same surface as the computer; or the replacement of the cord by an extension arm would enable it to rest secure again the back of the computer, much like a multiple adapter that's plugged into an AC outlet.  All the same, I didn't design it, and I didn't pay much for it.  No complaints, no regrets, I'm tired of placing big bets, here's to a self-powered mini hub!

He also uses a touchpad.My job involves using GIS, creating maps and slight, tiny movements of the cursor. It takes about 2 weeks to re-teach your hand how to do these movements using a track pad and there was a few days that i wanted to toss this out the window but persistence pays off. I can honestly say that I don't miss a mouse at all. Use the help and instructions, set it up the way you want and you'll find yourself wishing that all trackpads worked the same way.

Temp under heavy use would exceed 140 degrees with the CM 212 the CPU hasn't exceeded 120 degrees and usually stays between 110-115 degrees and runs almost silent. The 212 uses a 120mm fan so it is a large heatsink and the heat is directed to the top of the case so it is not for everyone. The install in my case was easy because I have access to the back of the mother board install from start to finish took no more than fifteen minutes.

The biggest issue is when panning - there is no front/back support so you have to use your hand to steady the camera and keep it from falling forward. If you aren't going for any motion in your video shots, then it works just fine.As a still photo tripod, I love it. It's lightweight, sturdy, and offers plenty of height.Bottom line: Still worth the price for a nice travel tripod, but look elsewhere for your video needs.

I just left it alone happy to have it rotate through my many gigabytes of photos.  After a couple of weeks, the display went gray, but un-plugging it and in a few minutes plugging it back it reset the device, and all was fine.

$review_text.: I received a defective chip and I am waiting for the seller to respond. With mine the sound levels kept going up and down every forth or fifth song and it was annoying to adjust the sound level 2-5 dB (decibels) every 15 minutes. The song selection is also terrible with only a small percentage being songs that were popular and/or played on the radio. Either way when you consider that maybe ~25% are good (not great), I probably would have kept it if it did not have the sound level problems that also included skipping on some songs and a occasional crackling/scratching noise. I heard approximately 5 hours worth (about 80+ songs) so I can't tell you more than what I heard and my experience. Maybe if I heard 50 hours, there would be a higher/lower percentage of good songs - who knows as I can't find a published list of songs anywhere.

$review_text.: Sounds incredible as most reviews seem to convey, I'm of the opinion that the bass response is excellent (versus standard earbuds and other small form factor earphones that I've tried), but these are certainly not for anybody active.  Walking to-from work requires a little time arranging the cords so they're not rubbing up against anything and gently suspended from my ears.  Any little friction against clothing, skin, bookbag, etc.  transmits noise really quite well.  Forget about running and/or jogging with these as all you will hear is the sound of the cord banging around with every footstep.  Summary: sounds great, very comfortable, cord design could be better, and a little buyer's remorse over the $$$.

$REVIEW.: I have to first qualify this review by stating that I was looking for a basic wireless router that was inexpensive, easy to configure, had built in security enabled, and provided good performance.  The reason  I say this is that there a lots of high end routers that provide many features that are overkill for a lot of people.  This router provides excellent value and is easy for a novice to configure.  Here is specifically what I liked about the product:1.  Plug it in and it works!  Security is enabled and it connects easily to your Internet Service with a fast and simple configuration that walks you quickly through the process.2.  The router has a unique security password already programmed into it  and it is listed on the body of the router which seems to be the new norm with all of the NETGEAR routers.  This helps to provide a  secure network for people who do not want to spend the time configuring a router.  They just want it to work!!3.  The router has good coverage.  When placed in the middle room of my two story house it reached all ends  of the house (2300 square feet) as well as my front and back yard (although the back yard only had two out of 5 bars).4.  Rather unobtrusive after you turn off the big blue light on the top of the unit.  This is in the configuration menu and it is easy to find and turn off.  Many companies either make it impossible to find or do not allow you to turn it off.  While it is kind of nice if you like a techie look, it can be distracting and an issue if the unit is located next to a TV or in a bedroom.  So, you have the option for techie blue light or no light!!5.  Works great as an access point, a router, or as a secondary router (connect it to a LAN port on another router to create a separate network that is isolated from the first network).6.  The unit will automatically reset its assigned address base if you connect it to another router to prevent IP address conflicts.7.  An easy to use interface that while not providing as many options as a high end router, it certainly provides everything that many people will want or need.What I did not like about the router:1.  It only supports the 2.4 Ghz bandwidth.  This is probably not a big issue for many people as the common band assigned is 2.4 Ghz and it is also the band that has the most range.  While the 5 Ghz band is nice to have for streaming video, the 2.4 works just fine.  I was easily able to stream 3 separate videos to three different TVs from Amazon, Hulu, and Netflix.2.  The big Blue light on top.  As I mentioned above, you can easily turn it off in the software but I would prefer the default to be off instead of on.3.  The router seems a bit sensitive to its reporting of network attacks but I would rather have it more sensitive than not sensitive enough.  This does NOT affect your usage, just the reporting.  NETGEAR is providing an update to their software that will fix this reporting issue.This is a GREAT product for anyone who just wants an inexpensive router that has good coverage, is easy to use, and just plain and simple works!  Yes, there are more expensive routers out there that provide a lot more features, but for many people that is just plain overkill.I would buy this router and i would recommend it to anyone who just wants a basic router that works.

$REVIEW.: Comparative Results: Technically Average, Overall Value Excellent (4 stars for build quality, but still the best value)**Explanation**Explanation of technique used for Review (actual results are below with accompanying title).My first inclination when I received this cable, was to attempt to do a side-by-side comparison of various HDMI cables to determine what benefit, if any the various cables provide. To make such a test fair however, I had to find identical televisions, input devices, (cable box, blu-ray, standard dvd, etc), and a place to put them; as you may imagine this proved to be way more effort than it would be worth.After contemplating the issue I came to the conclusion that such a test would be pretty worthless anyways. Since I (like most people) never watch identical televisions side by side the real question lies in whether one HDMI cable improves the picture enough that it is discernable without viewing the pictures simultaneously. After all, if a viewer cannot discern a difference between the two without looking at both together, then there is no justifiable reason to buy one over the other.With this in mind I used the following equipment to test the cables:Television: Sony Grand WEGA KDS-55A2000 55-Inch SXRD 1080p Rear Projection HDTVCables:1.HDMI Cable 6ft 6 ft 1.3 1080P FOR PS3 TO DVD LCD HDTV2.Cables To Go 98035 Premium HDMI v1.3 Digital Audio/Video Cable (8 Feet, Black/Grey)3.Mediabridge - 6ft Ultra-High Speed HDMI Cable - 120 Hz - Version 1.3 Category 2 - 1080p - PS3 - Blu-Ray4.Monster M Series M1000 HDTV HDMI Cable (8 ft. / 2.43 m.)5.Sony 5mm High speed HDMI cable ver. 1.3 (White)Inputs:1.PlayStation 3 80GB2. Optimum HD Cable Box/DVR (not sure of the model number)**The Test**To conduct the test I had my wife label each of the cables with a number, the cables were mixed then piled together behind the television. With my wife assigned as the operator. I and two friends sat on the other side of the television. We watched pieces of Planet Earth on Blu-Ray, as well as Transformers on Blu-Ray and Standard Def. In addition, we watched the same song from American Idol in both HD and SD, and portions of an NBA playoff game.Each of us had a card numbered 1-5 with space for comments on image quality, sound, etc., for each cable. The test was, as aforementioned, blind. This was to ensure that one of my friends (one of whom provided the $200 monster cable) and I, owner of the .01 + shipping no name cable (and most of the other ones) would not be biased by knowing it was our cable. If you shell out $200 for something you really want it to outperform, which creates bias.And now:**The Results**All three of us agreed that there were no conclusive differences in the test. After a lot of switching between various inputs the conclusion was that while we occasionally perceived slight differences it was never clear and would be impossible to tell if the two pictures were not side by side.Thus I must conclude that these 5 HDMI cables are, for all practical purposes, identical. Which means that they all had average performance and the main purchase determiners are price, aesthetic quality and build quality.So to sum up, taking into account my opinion of the different cables, the HDMI Cable 6ft 6 ft 1.3 1080P FOR PS3 TO DVD LCD HDTV is the cheapest and feels it, it will probably need to be replaced soonest as well but at .01 cent plus shipping you can afford to. The Cables To Go 98035 Premium HDMI v1.3 Digital Audio/Video Cable (8 Feet, Black/Grey) and Mediabridge - 6ft Ultra-High Speed HDMI Cable - 120 Hz - Version 1.3 Category 2 - 1080p - PS3 - Blu-Ray were pretty similar but I like the design and build quality of the Cable-to-Go a little more, it feels more solid, I feel like this one would last a while longer than the first cable but I didn't do any endurance tests. My least favorite of the bunch in terms of feel/price was the Sony 5mm High speed HDMI cable ver. 1.3 (White) which I felt, was very thin and cheap feeling considering its price tag, I wouldn't bet that it would outlast either the Cable-to-Go cable or the Mediabridge. The Monster M Series M1000 HDTV HDMI Cable (8 ft. / 2.43 m.) is well made and aesthetically pleasing and looks as if it will last you until something replaces HDMI, I cannot however recommend it because the price tag is simply preposterous, as it provides no visual or auditory improvement.

$review_text.: I haven't used one of these type of recorders in 15 years, but I thought it would be nice to have one for travel or lectures.  I like to be able to set up a device without too much instruction.  That is not possible with this recorder. Set up happens fairly automatically, but somehow I got the time wrong.  I tried to go back and set the time again but ran into a problem.  So I decided to consult a manual,  all that was in the box was the set up flyer with stupid photos.  It did not tell anything useful for operating the recorder.  Oh, I have to go online and look up a PDF for a manual.  I really like to hold a manual in my hand.  But I understand the reason for not printing them.I never have changed the time.  I did accomplish recording and playing back although I have not been able to figure out all of the features.  I am looking forward to having time to really work on understanding and using this product.

$review_text.: It looks like I too am experiencing some of the playback problems that many are having.  I bought this unit in October of 2009 based upon the great reviews on the Amazon website.  The player worked well until the last few months.  It seems that none of the newer titles I have bought will play.  I tried updating the firmware through the LG website, but that did not work.  I called LG and gave them my list of movies that will not play:  Percy Jackson, How to Train Your Dragon, Toy Story 3 and Shrek 4.  They sent me a disc to update the firmware, but that did not help either.  My older titles load and play just fine.  I certainly expected my player to work with newer titles as they were released.  I have called LG yet again and they are going to try to investigate the problem for me again.  I guess I can just wait another 3 weeks for an updated disc that will probably not solve my problem.  It looks like I might be springing for a new player after just over a year of use.  This time I will opt for a different manufacturer with wifi so that the unit can update itself.  This is the secod time that I have been burned by a LG product.  There will not be a third.

$REVIEW.: If you want to just carry your tablet around your shoulder then this bag will do job well.  I had no problem sliding in my iPad Air tablet with protective case.The bag is opened by lifting the flap open.  It is held in place via Velcro.  There are total of three zippered pocket (one in front of flap, one in rear of flap and third one when you lift open the flap at the bag itself).  The pockets are only useful for small items like airline tickets, passports and other nicknacks.  Anything more, it won't fit or make the bag look out of shape.There is small slot on each side of bag enough to hold couple of pens and pencils.  There is one large slot outside that is enough to hold couple of magazines.Inside, you will find padded compartment to hold your tablet in place via Velcro and additional compartments to hold more paper items or possibly another tablet.Buy this bag if you want to take your tablet every time you go outside.  It sure beat holding your tablet all the time in your hand.

$REVIEW.: This transformer can produce 220V or 110V output from 220V or 110V service.  I use it to provide 110V in my well house, which has only 220V (no neutral) service.  It works fine.  I took the case apart to check the wiring, which was solid, with no loose connections.A theoretically perfect transformer would consume no power if no power was being drawn from the load side.  In the real world, transformers have multiples kinds of losses.  This one consumes about 30W of power all the time, even with no load.  These losses are proportional to size, so if you don't need a 1500W transformer, you might want something smaller.I run mostly low-current loads, but I've run a large Shop-Vac on the 110V output without problems.A pluggable jumper on the rear panel lets you choose the input voltage.  In my case, I could choose betweenthe 220V setting and the 240V setting with corresponding changes in output voltage.  If you're using it for110V to 220V applications, you can choose between 110V and 120V input settings.Recommended.

$REVIEW.: Looking on amazon, thinking, a 2000watt rms amplifier for 120$ total? Some things were too good to be true. I'll leave this review with a decent list of pros and cons, but theres some things that NEED to be said. First- This amplifier does NOT allow you to mount it anywhere. You must take off the 2 brackets on the sides with a hex key, then you have this extremely narrow hole to put your screws. A pain, but not the reason why i knocked any stars off.Heres the thing, even if this amplifier could do 1000 watts, you pretty much can't. It has extremely small terminals, that I can't even fit any 4 gauge terminals or wire into, not alone the 0 gauge I had ran out to it. After so long, I ended up giving up, running a small 8 gauge from a 0 gauge distrubtion block. ANY powerful amp typically uses either decent sized terminals, or a direct connection without terminals at all. Even my 200 watt boss 4 channel amp has bigger terminals than this thing.And here brings us to the big reality, this amp is 650rms at 1 ohm. Plugged a dyno into it, and it couldn't budge above 650. Why? It has 2 30 amp fuses, making it impossible to go above 720watts. Just for one, I plugged up 4 4ohm subwoofers totalling up to 1ohm and 1700watts rms, and this thing couldn't push any of them half way decent.BUT! Bottom line, if you want a subpar amp to power about 550-700watts of a subwoofer, this is....ok? Just believe me, its not the power rating that makes me mad. Its the fact that planet audio thought they could put these SMALL terminals on it, and making it harder to mount this thing than to become rich.

You can connect to a PC to exchange data, but you cannot connect a USB device (camera to download pictures, flash drive) to the tablet without a USB Host adapter. That adapter is not included, and according to Lenovo, is not available. If you need to connect USB devices, don't bother with this tablet.Also, for an Android newbie. Setting up and using the tablet can be daunting. Documentation is poor, and figuring out how to do the initial setup and which of the numerous included apps are worth keeping can be time consuming.

But I decided to keep it and actually prompted me to purchase a 55-200mm lens that fit perfectly.  I don't regret the lens purchase which was unexpected.  But all turned out well, since the lens was versatile for my outing with the camera without chugging along lot of extra lenses.

$REVIEW.: I use this for my two TiVos (one on each) and with my Apple Airport Extreme system.Only caveat is I had to set the Airport Extreme to 802.11b only
 For some reason this won't work with 802.11b/g mode on the TiVo
 This is a TiVo issue because it worked fine on my two laptops (one running Win2k and one running win xp)

$REVIEW.: For the money these are hard to beat ,  great bass out of a little unit along with decent mid and upper range . These sound better than my old koss pro4AA's or  Realistic Pro 60's from radio shack.  They work well on a mp3 player , but if you stick them on good stereo player not  mp3's  you'll know what I mean . I'm hearing good heavy bass on things I didn't even know it existed .Update:  Have used these for a few years now .  Eventually the inline volume control will flake out ,the earpads will flatten to the point of being very uncomfortable.  You can get replacements pads for like $5 from koss.  If you ever have a problem  with the KTX's  or any koss headphone you just go their website , get an rma number and send them back to koss  and in less than 2 weeks they will send you a "brand" new pair of these  no questions asked.  What other company backs stuff like that for life on a $20 product ?

$review_text.: After owning two previous versions of Sony's multi-disc players I was very disappointed in this player.  Sony seems to have left out some simple ease of use features that are offered in previous players.  I thought you were supposed to improve features in newer models, not remove them. Here are the features I thought should have been included.1. Ability to jump to a certain disc number. This system makes you thumb your way down a list to select a disc. This can be very annoying if you are heading to disc 350, since the menus do not roll over. This feature is on other Sony 400 disc players.2. Ability to disable/enable Blu-Ray live for a single disc or on the fly if desired.  The player setting for Blu live is ON/OFF for the system, it could have an "ask" feature also.  The Playstation does.3.  Ability to load only unread discs.  This player allows you to load (get info from gracenote) from one disc or ALL discs. There is no "unloaded discs" option. So if you add a group of discs you must load all discs in the entire player or each one added individually.These features are simple to include and hopefully they add it to a future software release.  If these simple time saving features were added it make my review go from 2 stars to 5.

$REVIEW.: THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE EARLIER P21 HEADSET. WHY AMAZON PUT MY REVIEW ON THIS PAGE FOR A DIFFERENT PRODUCT, I DON'T KNOW. SEE THE BOTTOM FOR DIFFERENCES OF THE 2 STRAIGHT FROM THE TURTLE BEACH WEBSITE.==========================================================================================================I bought this based on someone talking about it in a SOCOM match. The reviews here also were good. First off, I don't have a true surround system. You really need that when playing shooter type games to hear where your enemy is around you. This headset does a pretty good job in helping you locate the enemy. But it is far from perfect. First off, its not built that well for the price. In "Stereo Expander" mode there is a loud background hiss. Chat Boost does not work at all. The quality of the headphone speakers are what you would expect from a $[...] pair of headphones. I know headphone quality, I have headphones ranging in price from $[...] to $[...]. And one of the most annoying things about this headset is the noise the plastic makes every time you move your head. All that being said, you can hear much more in a game then you would normally. I play SOCOM and my gameplay got better because now I can hear people walking around and tell which direction they are from me. The increase in my score was enough that if offsets all the negative things about this headset.PROSLong CordEasy Set UpHelps you locate the enemy in shooter gamesSeparate game and voice volume controlsBass Boost works moderately wellSeems sturdy enough to last awhileYou can turn the mic offGood for when you want to not play and wake people upCONSBackground hiss in expanded modeMaterials make noise whenever you moveSound quality not that greatEarphone cups are a little smallChat Boost doesn't work, at least not inSOCOM: US Navy Seals Confrontation Stand AloneOverall, if you don't have surround and play shooter type games I recommend it. Otherwise, I would not bother.UPDATE:  Keep an eye on the metal pin that holds the clip in place. It barely locks in and can work its way out. Took about 15 minutes to get it back in, pain in the butt. So check to see if its working its way out every so often.========================================================================================================FROM THE TURTLE BEACH WEBSITEEar Force P21 vs. PX21 ComparisonIf you're wondering what improvements have been made in the Ear Force PX21, here's a summary of how it compares to its highly acclaimed predecessor, the Ear Force P21:The PX21 Works With XBOX 360.An XBOX LIVE mic jack on the PX21 amplifier makes it compatible with the XBOX 360. All of the features that make the PX21 a great PS3(tm) headset also function on the XBOX 360.Works With PC & Mac Without Adapters.The PX21 replaces the P21 dual RCA jacks with a 3.5mm audio plug, so it works with PC's and Mac's without the need for an extra adapter.Acoustically Tuned Ear CupsThe PX21 ear cups, ear cushions and speakers are acoustically tuned for optimum fidelity. That means you'll hear crisper highs and deeper lows for an improved gaming experience.Improved HeadbandThe PX21 headband has been increased in size for greater comfort.Improved USB Audio ConnectionThe PX21 uses a stereo USB audio chat channel with improved fidelity, compared to a mono USB chat channel on the P21. This means you can use the PX21 as a stereo USB headset for listening to music and other stereo sources on your PC or Mac.Improved Ear CushionsThe PX21 ear cushions use the same soft fabric weave as the popular X31 and X41 headsets, with deeper and softer cushion material for even more comfort than the P21.Improved DesignThe striking chrome rings on the PX21 make it stand out as a high-quality headset that looks like a natural companion to the PS3.

I can't say enough about the easy and smoothness of its handling. Even as the rookie I am, it still makes me look like I've had many hours flying it. Like all electric RC aircraft, the batteries are a drawback with such limited flight time. I would suggest buying at least two extra batteries when you purchase the phantom to make sure you get enough flight time in each time out. I have 4 standard batteries and one extra life one which only gets me another three minutes.

$review_text.: I'm generally a fan of Thule products.  They are very well constructed and usually have a load of extra features.  I have to admit this camera bag was initially puzzling to me.  What am I supposed to fit in here, and why the lunchbag style top?If you actually want to store a camera in the protective hard shell part of the case:** Per manufacturer:  "Designed specifically to fit GoPro, Contour and Sony action sport cameras"** In reality you can put any flat P&S; camera in the hardshell case.  I put my Sony RX100 in there, fits great.  Plenty of room for accessories like an extra battery, cable, SD cards.  Then the lunchbag style top can be used for whatever will fit, including snacks!  I also tried a old Canon SX100, a clunky older P&S; and an older Canon HF100 video camera (bulges out to top a little).If you want to use this for a 4/3 camera:I was able to pack my Panasonic G5 camera for a recent excursion.  I placed the telephoto (45-150mm) lens (fir perfectly), a spare battery, a small 3D lens (or filters), and extra lens cap in the bottom.  I put the G5 with kit lens (14-45mm) and strap in the lunchbag compartment.  Granted, there is no protection for the camera, but I was merely using this as an organizing bag.  Once I arrived at my destination, my camera spent most of the time out of the bag ready to shoot pictures.  I DON'T think a Sony NEX will fit well due to the size of the lenses, maybe just the kit lens and extra prime lens.If you want to use this for a full size DSLR:That's not what the bag is intended for, and I doubt you'll get anything significant to fit.Closing it up:The 9 hook is a quick and easy way to secure the bag, but it would have been nice to have some kind of loop handle to make the bag easier to grab and carry.WARNING:1.  If you put your SD cards in the slots (3 of them), make sure to enclose them in the small plastic case and touch something metal to discharge static electricity before using.  The fabric is nice, but may give you a static charge residue that may destroy the data on your card.  It probably would have been better to forgo the fabric in this case (though it is a nice tactile feel).2.  The Hardshell case is only for the bottom and sides.  The top is thinner, and counts on the SD card flap and lunchbag bottom to provide cushion/protection.
$SUMMARY.: Designed for small flat cameras, not for 4/3, not for SLR.

$review_text.: I have purchased various camera grips for Canon Cameras, as a Pro-photographer, I cannot live without the grip mainly for the portrait shooting feature.  I have never owned a Canon grip and do not intend to.Pros:  It fits, its strong, its comfortable, it has all the cool features and functions of a Canon Grip, its far cheaper.Cons:  I'm sure that it is not as sturdy as a Canon grip, and people say it is not weather sealed like a true Canon, and I'm sure that is true.  That is your choice not mine as to which you need.I really like shooting with the grip, the dual batteries is great as I never have to think about batteries when shooting. In the end the only difference that I can see is going to be weather sealing and that is very important to some shooters.As for me, I'm very happy and do not wish for the Canon grip as this does exactly what I need.  Also, I have never had any of these "knock-off" grips fail save one and the manufacturer sent me a brand new one for free.

$REVIEW.: When I first saw the NT case online I was thrilled about how nice it looked, as it looks just like a laptop, and indeed it did except I absolutely hated the clip on circle part of the case. Unfortunately there is no way at all to lock the 360 spinning portion on the case and when I am using it to write notes, it keeps bobbling back and forth thus making my strokes of my stylus not as nice as I want. It is a pain to take handwritten notes with this case as no matter which position I tried, it does not want to stay still, so if NT incorporated some way to lock the rotating part it would be very nice. Even with the case off, the groove on the back of the case makes the case not sit flat thus wobble. Basically the only problems I have with this case is that rotating part, it just causes a whole lot of inconvenience when taking notes. The stand portion, you can slide it out and use it like a monitor, that feature works fine but it has to be in the correct position. I saw a misleading video which stated that the case can be used in an iMac position, where the iPad is elevated from the stand and make it look nicer, but unfortunately the iPad is too heavy for that and will fall, is is mainly due to the loose clip on part and rotating part. I found that the keyboard angle is not very good, it is at a 90 degree angle without pulling the stand portion out. It is a hassle to pull out the stand every time and have to struggle to put it back when I am done using it, I wish the angle were a little bit better, or the pull out feature was easier to use. I cannot extend the pull out portion all the way while I am in lecture due to the small size of the desk so I am unable to get the perfect typing angle. I am guessing it is hard to pull out since my case is still new and I have not pulled it out that much. Finally the case adds a bit of bulk onto the iPad, after carrying it around for a while, I rather just carry around my MacBook air as it weighs almost the same. But I am guessing if I wanted something thinner I should have gotten the Airbender Air instead of this one. It is missing a Smart Cover opening on the back cover which would have been nice.If you like to take handwritten notes with your iPad this case is not for you as there is no way to take stable notes.Although the case has its downsides for note-taking by hand, it is great for typing notes. The keyboard on the case is very nice, the keys are spread out so that it is not easy to accidentally tap on the wrong key. The keyboard pairs with the iPad very easily and seamlessly so it is ready whenever you need to use it. The top row contains specific buttons which you can use to control the iPad which is very useful. I can say that I can type pretty fast with this case, which is a plus when you are taking notes in class or writing and essay. This case is very slick and good looking, it looks very advanced and is very protective. The outside of the case is quite durable as I have dropped my backpack with the iPad in this case and everything was fine. Every part on this case is very nicely built and it does not feel that cheap at all, the hinges are strong so I feel safe with this on my iPad as it will not break or fall off. I think this case would be perfect for me as I sometimes tend to accidentally throw things around, but I know that this case is strong because it was stuck on the back on my iPad and I was unable to remove the back cover. I even tried using a credit card on it to try to loosen it, unfortunately the case put a dent in my card. Then I figured it out, to remove the case grasp the top right corner and the bottom left and pop it out and it should easily come out. The case also smells like new Apple products which is quite unique. The battery life on the keyboard is great, I didn&#8217;t ever need to recharge it even after using it extensively. The one thing I like the most is that even though there is a keyboard on the case and it closes so seamlessly, there are legs which protect the screen so it does get scratched and it does not leave marks like the Smart Cover does.Everything in this case just fits perfectly together and seamlessly, I still believe that the Pros outweigh the Cons, but for my purposes I did not like using it to take handwritten notes. Whenever I have a class which will require me to take typed notes, I update this post.ProsVery StrongDurableNice LookingGood KeyboardEasy to use and integrateDetachableMany different features and positionConsWobbles for handwritingSome part are too stiffBulkyNo backlightSomewhat pricey

$review_text.: I purchased a few 27" monitors in the past and experienced a slightly distorted/ffuzzy view at 1920x1080 resolution.  The VX2703MH-LED-Lit is a huge impvovement over the ViewSonic VX2753MH-LED monitor i purchased a little over a year ago.  Generally 24" monitors always had better resolution for my primary applications (large spreadsheets), but this 27" has similar image quality.  The 10,000,000:1 Contrast Ratio seems to be a good configuration for looking at large spreadsheets or detail documents.  This monitor even works well with the USB display adapters, although I am using HDMI for video.  It has every bit of the quality and sharpness you tend to get from a smaller (24") display.  The VESA mount included with this model is also a welcomed feature.
$SUMMARY.: Crisp/Sharp display for data - contrast and clarity comparable to smaller high end monitor.

$review_text.: This is a very nice case.  Very good quality and nice looking.  The Ipad Air fits in perfectly - all openings line up properly with the charging port, camera, on/off buttons, etc.  I was a little worried about the flap which holds the Ipad in the case, but it does keep the Ipad Air stationary and secure. I haven't noticed any shifting. The magnets keep the case closed so it is safe to put into your handbag.  There are two things I don't like about the case.  On the inside of the front cover there are two card/id holders which prevent the front cover from folding over a couple of times to give a cushioned one handed grip when reading.  The other is the fact that this case does not support the sleep/wake function which I have come to really like.  All in all it is a nice case though if this hadn't been on the Vine program I would not have purchased it.  The cost is high and there are other cases out there that provide the sleep/wake function and the same form for a lower cost.  This will do until the Roocase Origami cover is released later this month.

$REVIEW.: Not many years ago, wall mounts for flat-screen TVs typically cost $100 or more.  The VideoSecu mount is made of good quality materials and the components operate smoothly.  We mounted a 19" TV near the corner of a kitchen countertop so that it can be folded flat against one of the walls to make full use of the countertop when the TV isn't being used.  We did not encounter any of the tilt or leveling issues described by a couple reviewers, perhaps because I checked both horizontal and vertical leveling before installing the 2nd wallmounting screw.  Also, drilling pilot holes prior to installing the mounting screws helps avoid damage to the screw heads and makes it easier to intall the screws.

$REVIEW.: Purchased from 'zon on 12-2-2013 for 20.20 bucks.Sent back shortly thereafter.What was my intended usage:A black lightning cable for charging/audio-out from the built-in USB-adapter in the upper glovebox of a vehicle (Honda Fit '09 Sport with black interior) with iOS audio routing compatibility.Why did I send it back?#1) It's too thick. Standard cables are easily able to go through the small gap between dash and glovebox lip. This one i just too thick and won't let the glovebox close comfortably. It is just barely latched and is ready to pop open.#2) it's WAY too taut. if this is plugged in to the phone. The phone can either sit dangling from this cable b/c the cable is SOO taut! just in front of the passenger, or... I don't know, go in the passenger top right drink holder? silly. Do not attempt to put this on the little edge between the glove boxes, as it will fall off unless you have a high-friction/anti-slip case. This all means a driver shouldn't even attempt to use it alone. Too dangerous. I'm not going to buy a USB extension cable to pair with a coiled cable, it doesn't make sense, sorry! I also would pull this thing taut without supporting the other end (i.e. running it through the close glovebox at least), as there is WAY too much tension and I would be afraid of likely damaging whatever receiving plug the USB end was plugged into. Sometimes pulling on it just popped the glovebox open, OR popped it out of the iPhone.#3) Griffin usually charges a premium, b/c they work closely with Apple, and tend to have their products certified. However, reading many reviews here, and having used griffin products in the past, they are not always of high quality to match their price tag. I'm glad I sent it back, as this thing was going to be under massive strain if I continued to use it as I did in my testing since it's SO SHORT AND TAUT. I wouldn't trust the cable not to be destroyed, even if the attached devices (especially on the USB END, i.e. car, computer, wall charger) escaped unharmed.What worked?#1) It didn't complain (very often) about compatibility (5s/7.0.3). This is MUCH more likely a feature of iOS 7 or the 5s, not the cable its self. iOS 4 with an iPhone 4 complained quite a bit. The honda fit was purchased when iOS 4 was current. I think iOS 5 devices had the hardest time connecting to this Honda Fit '09 (Sport?) interface, but I could get them to connect usually after persistence.#2) It did fit through a Pong Research Anti-Radiation Rugged Case for 5s, just barely.#3) It DID route audio to the sound system!Still, I wanted something to actually work in the specified car, and match the upholstery. This seemed like it was the answer, but was actually an experiment in the opposite direction.
$SUMMARY.: Purchased for a 5s in a Honda FIt '09... poor results.

$REVIEW.: I have never used another GPS, so I cannot compare to others, but the Garmin eTrex Legend is everything I wanted in a GPS for the price I was willing to pay. I use it for hiking and geocaching and it's perfect. I did have to read some online sites to help me make better use of it (the manual has a lot of information, but presented with an assumption that you know how to use GPS).I love how easy it is to get to the menu items and selections I want with just a click or two. I use rechargeable batteries and after several hours of use already, the capacity still shows full. I did lose satellite under tree cover which I assume is normal. I use the included cable to upload and download information to my pc which is very useful. Overall, I am extremely satisfied.

$REVIEW.: Nice enough, easy to set up, but two gripes which left me feeling deflated:1. the LCD screen isn't exactly going to impress anyone who's used to working on laptops or owners of flat panel televisions - the image quality is a tad poor - I would have hoped for a higher resolution screen for this price2. the stand on the back of the unit doesn't allow for the unit to be propped up more vertically, meaning that if you have the frame in a chest height shelf or chest of drawers, the frame tilts back to a point where the image is difficult to view with any clarity.  you can experiment with what I'm trying to explain by tilting your laptop backwards, and watch the clarity and quality of the screen lower.

$REVIEW.: I already had an FM attachment for my iPod, but it was clumsy - it had an earphone jack, but was powered by batteries, which I had to replace way too often for a transmitter that had a very limited range (about 1 foot).The iTrip looked perfect for my needs - self-powered by the iPod, and sexy-looking to boot.The iTrip ships with a CD, which contains several dozen .mp3 files, one for each station/channel on broadcast FM. If you only use your iPod in one city, then you will rarely have to change stations, as the station that's "free" - ie, doesn't have a radio station broadcasting a signal on it, is unlikely to change that often - but if you go on a road trip, you may want to change the frequency once in a while.The first time I tried out my iTrip, I went on a road trip from the Dallas area to Shreveport, Louisiana. I was taking the trip anyway, not just to test the iTrip! Anyway, I didn't think to create a play list just for the iTrip stations before I synched (it would have been nice if the documentation w/ the iTrip suggested this), so I had my iTrip on random/shuffle play on my whole library - lo and behold, it hits another frequency .mp3 and resets my ipod to a different station. There is no way to delete an item directly from the iPod w/o synching with a computer - so I was out of luck and had an extremely frustrating trip until I saw a Radio Shack on the way and bought one of those Cassette-Jack adapters.  So, everytime one of the Griffin .mp3 files would come up on random shuffle, I'd hit the "next" arrow on the iPod to skip it - since it's obnoxiously loud.Griffin had an excellent idea with this gizmo, but I doubt they did any field testing first, otherwise they would have rethought their approach.  With the Apple Software Developer Kit (SDK), they could have written an application for the iPod that let you control the settings for iTrip, instead of making .mp3 files be the trigger for setting the device... this way no one has to make different play lists to accommodate a third party gadget.I was so happy to buy this item, and now it lays in a drawer because it's too frustrating to use. The range is also less than impressive. I know that the FCC has rules on how strong a radio transmitter can be for this type of device, but I should be able to use the iPod when it's in the passenger seat - but apparently that's too far from my stereo! I had to lay it in my ashtray to get a good signal.Great concept, beautiful design, crappy execution.

$review_text.: So this adapter is cheaper than its Alfa counterparts but it does have some flaws
For one thing, build quality is not amazing, the Antennas are too big even for 1000mw and there is not wall-mount mechanism

On the bright side, performance-wise this does compete fearlessly with the Alfas but again...Also: about the antenna connectors, does anyone know what size those are? They're smaller than the standard connector the Alfas and most routers use.Also to mention is this works great under Kali Linux (Backtrack) and there is full support for Aircrack-ng suit and Airodump actually gives quite a bit more info, there is also a bit more interference than with my other Alfa.

Its extremely thin


You only need a couple of pieces of tape (if you choose not to use the mounts provided) to stick it to a wall/window
I'm up in Seattle and easily get 10-14 channels

You probably want something much stronger if you live in a more sparsely populated place


See antennaweb.org for an estimate of the kind of antenna you'll need.Amazing buy and MADE IN USA! How can you go wrong here? Good bye Comcast!

My father liked the idea of the solar panel for days when he is sitting outdoors and expressed an interest in having one.  I saw this one on Amazon and it had the features I was looking for - the crank, solar panel, an emergency light (and good reviews). When he opened it on Christmas, my father immediately gave it some cranks and turned it on. He was very impressed with the sound considering how small the radio is. He definitely likes it and will make good use of it this summer to listen to the ballgames, music, and talk radio.

$REVIEW.: I read reviews, and read reviews and read some more before purchasing a security system. I am not some super smart computer person so I was a little intimidated about the thought of wiring this and getting it all going. I was totally amazed at how easy it was. It couldn't be simpler, everything is color coded. We decided where we wanted the cameras before we started the install. We were installing all 8 outside. The holes we had to drill are very small and if our attic were full size, man how easy it would have been. Outside of that, it was the easiest thing we have ever installed. Plug and go, it was that simple. People had stated in some reviews that there were no instructions. There is a small disc that has the users manual on it and its also available online, I had looked at it before purchasing.I haven't gotten into the programming a lot. I got this because I love gadgets and I am hoping to get a discount on my homeowners insurance. Outside of that, its a blast to sit and watch the cameras, as I have almost 5 acres and can view a lot of it.  It doesn't have near the distance at night, because it gets really dark in the country, but I have dogs for that. The daytime distance is very clear, and I can see all the way to three property lines very clearly. It is probably about 100ft to the front and a little less to both sides. The bulk of my property is behind me, but around my house, is very well covered. I don't want to confuse anyone that I am covering the entire 5 acres.I am thrilled with the quality of the video. The only thing hard about the install was due to our attic being so short you cannot stand up in it. If you have a stand up attic height you have it made!  I have had this installed for a couple of months and I would recommend this system to anyone.Update  august 30/2013 I have seen a few people on here that have had their hard drive fail.. Mine also failed. I guess the company got a bad batch. But I wanted to update my experience with customer service which was totally not like one I read. My system is set to auto overwrite when full.  When it got full, it stopped recording, notifying me of this with an alarm noise. I tried all the trouble shooting ideas in the user guide. Non of them worked. When you go to the defender website it doesn't post a number for customer service. It wants you to fill out a form and have them call you. I wanted to talk to someone soon, so I called the sales number and in the auto bot information there was a choice for customer service. I did have to wait on hold for 20 minutes but the customer service was excellent. The lady I got talked to me about the the trouble shooting and I told her what I had tried but we walked thru them again. She said I needed to send it in and she emailed me a form to include in the box for service. I did have to pay the postage to mail it back, but they paid it when they sent me a new one back. She told me it could be 2 to 4 wks before it was returned, but the turn around was much faster right now, but they are required to tell everyone that. From the day I mailed it back, to the day UPS delivered it back, was only 11 days including weekend days. Sometimes people are upset their item failed and get an attitude with customer service people from the get go, if you have ever worked customer service jobs, you definitely know what I mean. I still love my system and happy with my purchase, except now amazon is selling it 50 dollars cheaper than I paid! lol You can't win them all.

I did my research before buying the gold box deal, if you get an Optical to coax converter (http://www.amazon.com/Cables-Go-40019-Optical-Converter/dp/B0002GV876/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1356362129&sr=8-1&keywords=optical+to+coaxial+digital+audio+converter) this bar will connect digitally to any TV. You can use the analog cables, but for me there was a HUGE difference in sound quality. Ice connected this bar works just fine, for $39 I didn't expect it to blow me away, but it is significantly better than my TV's speakers.  For the modes, I leave mine in music for everything, games mode sounds like a hallway, and news just amplifies voices.  One thing to note is this bar can only accept PCM audio output, which is usually a setting change (on the PS3, Sony TV's). While certainly not a 5 star product, for the $39 gold box deal this is a good sound bar.

The bass is warm and rich, better than the majority of headphones I've owned.+ Set-up and installation of software was easy.+ Sits comfortably on your head and adjusts easily (comes with a con see below).+ Lightweight (also a con, see below).+ Mic is clear, bendable and retractable/concealable inside the left ear cup.  A great feature.+ Headset cord is entirely covered with a black and red nylon preventing tangling.  Anotherreally great feature.+ Headset controls are convenient, easy to use and include mic mute and volume buttons.+ USB cord extender included.Cons- Pricey.  Way more expensive than it's worth.- Majority of the headset is made of plastic making it feel rather cheap- Initial cord is a bit too short.- Ear cups don't swivel/twist side to side like many of the other higher end headsets.- USB extender cord is not covered in the same red and black nylon as the headset cord.- Display lights are not LED.- No mic adjustments included in the software.- Doesn't grant pure noise isolation as the ear cups don't completely cover your ear.- Headset will start to pinch and hurt the side of your head if you're a glasses wearer.Unfortunately, a very common occurrence with most over the ear headphones.- Rather expensive.  You're primarily paying for the license.Although a bit on the pricey side, the SteelSeries Diablo III Gaming Headset is quite good for PC gaming.  I probably wouldn't drop the cash for the $120 purchase price with the list of Cons I detailed.  As other reviewers have stated, this headset should be priced in the $60 to $80 range.  Of course these things may not be cons for everyone so it really depends on your personal preferences, especially if you're a big fan of the Diablo series.  Despite the Cons it's a very functional and all around decent quality headset.

$review_text.: The HooToo 7-Port USB 3.0 Hub works great with all of my USB devices
I have the HooToo HDD Docking unit, a WD External HD, my optical mouse, and my HP Printer
I also used the 7-Port hub to charge my phone with the USB cable, and it worked without error.USB 3.0 being the latest and extremely fast connection, I was pretty excited to test this device out
When you plug in a USB device and it's powered on, the USB 3.0 hub has lights dedicated to the port you are using and helps you acknowledge that it's working correctly.The power cable and USB 3.0 cable included are long enough, so you can place it most anywhere near your computer and your devices without it being in the way
I enjoy the nice black finish to it, makes it look slick enough to contend with some of my other devices

Since you can technically have up to 127 devices hooked up to a single USB port, you could theoretically have 889 devices connected to this USB 3.0 hub
(check my math!)I enjoyed using this device as I haven't had one before

It was perfect for me to not only have everything going to a dedicated USB hub, but it is also a USB 3.0 hub
This means blazing fast data transfers and an always reliable USB connection.I know HooToo put care into this product, and made it look slick

I give the HooToo 7-Port USB 3.0 Hub the White-Out Stamp of Approval, and if you are looking for a perfect hub to centrally connect all of your peripherals, this should be at the top of your decision making choices.

$REVIEW.: Here's my experience:1) Movie playback on this TV is stuttering and quite distracting.  Any scene with where the camera pans and zooms at the same time jerks and blurs it's way through.  It's a huge step down from my prior Sony analog TV.  The issue is with the TV and not the DVD player: other display devices are smooth and pleasant.  The default TV settings are, for me, unwatchable.2) Integration with a Samsung DVD player is poor, despite HDMI-CEC support.  While I can pause/play from the TV remote, I still must use the DVD remote to start the movie.3) The menus and functions are disorganized.  While I am plenty capable at using electronics, the number of remote buttons and the inconsistency in their operation is grating.  The &#34;smart TV&#34; features appear glued onto the rest of the TV.  The TV brings up unnecessary and distracting messages often (such as &#34;disconnecting BD live&#34;).  The modes for movie playback (e.g. 24 fps, Auto Motion Plus, etc) are confusing, overlapping, and not explained well on the screen menus.4) The TV supports a keyboard, but... that only works for the built in web browser.  When searching on Amazon Prime Video, or NetFlix, you must use the tedious on screen keyboard.4) The unit has required service twice.  This time for service, Samsung wants me to &#34;carry in&#34; the unit to Englewood Colorado.  From San Francisco that's a 19 hour drive over two mountain ranges, 1251 miles away.I'd really prefer a good quality &#34;dumb&#34; TV without all this complexity, paired with a good quality and frequently updated streaming media player such as Roku.
$SUMMARY.: Poor choice for movie playback.  Awkward smart features.  Infuriating keyboard.  1,551 mile drive to have it serviced.

$REVIEW.: -INCREDIBLY useful tool for Photoshop editing!-Takes a little time to get used to the feel of using the tablet & stylus, if you're not already used to them.-Super easy installation that took about 15 minutes to download from CD.-Numerous sensitivity settings make it easy to tailor to your preferences, & is very responsive.-The four buttons on the side of the tablet can be toggled on/off in the program settings. Each button has about 15 options to choose from.-The round end of the stylus can be used as the eraser tool, if you so choose.-While editing small spaces, I recommend turning the dynamic feedback off, as this can be distracting.All in all, this is an awesome tool for use in Photoshop. This tablet will drastically cut your workflow time when compared to traditional mouse. I LOVE this tool!!!Comes with Photoshop Elements plus other software.

$review_text.: I should have known better, but at around ten bucks, I thought it would be worth a shot.  Imagine how many people think like that, send their money off only to receive this 50 piece of junk.  As P.T. Barnum said, "There's a sucker born every minute" and they profited from my minute.The internal "padding" peeled right off and no matter how hard I tightened it down, the lens would still spin and wobble.  Besides the fact it would not grip the lens, I wouldn't want to trust my lens to it for any reason.It's flimsy, cheap plastic.  Save your money (as well as your lens).

Have purchased another set of 8 batteries and currently upgraded my 3A batteries also. Purchased a great charger than deep-cycles them and conditions the battery every time. Great investment!

$REVIEW.: It took me quite a while to get everything working (wireless and viewwebcam) that I needed.  The basic camera setup was not bad when doing the wired connection on my local network.  That's when the "fun" began.  The wireless difficulty mostly had to do with my uncertainty as to what needed to be put in on the camera woreless page.  I've setup several wireless devices but they have always found the network on their own and then I just had to enter the security code.  After I realized that the SSID had to match the name of my wireless router it all came together.  The viewwebcam issue was partly due to something called "loopback".  Apparently many routers do not allow you to do the external access through viewwebcam while connected (even wirelessly) to your local network.  Access from outside of my house worked fine.  The biggest difficulty was in understanding what I needed to do to get my router happy with external access.  There is something called uPnP and my router (Microsoft LN-700) has it always on.  That fact took a lot of web searching to find out.  I also dug enough to find that other users recommended disabling uPnP in the camera setup and just going with port forwarding setup.  New territory for me but eventually I got it correctly set in my router setup.  All-in-all a lot of work to get going but I got it cheap and it does what I want it to.

$review_text.: The OmniMount PLAY 20 installed easily into a single stud.  No problems with the lag bolts or mounting the wall plate.  The TV mounting plate had perfect left to right and up and down spacing, but it did not have the correct length screws for mounting to a Samsung 29 inch.  There were three sets of screws/bolts included but none worked, either they were too big in diameter or too short.  One trip to the hardware store and 4 dollars later I had two differnt lengths of screws/bolts and the longer ones worked just fine.  The instructions called for a part that was not included in my bags of parts.  It is called a threaded cap.  The bolt that is supposed to thread into the cap was included but no cap.  I contacted Omnimount and did an online chat.  As near as the rep, me and the others at OmniMount could figure, the mounts are coming with new instruction pages but they are still shipping the older mount hardware  package.  The older mount does not come with a threaded cap.  It is not a big thing but it did suck up an hour of my time with online chats, and repeatedly checking the boxes for a part that was not there.I think a nut and a couple of washers will work just fine, or not worry about it and leave it out completly, as the older version dis not have this additional part.This mount still works well for me, but one needs to seriously visulalize how it moves to be able to figure if it will work for your situation.  I deducted one star for lack of proper hardware.  This will be used for small TV mountings and the screws/bolts supplied were not suitable.  I'd buy it againregardless.
$SUMMARY.: A good sturdy mount

$REVIEW.: These started off fairly strong--they fit well and the sound was decent.  Hey, I didn't have high expectations for less than $20.  I work out at the gym almost every day and always use headphones.  Over the course of about five months, these began to fit worse and worse. I think the hooks actually warped a bit.  So the necessity to adjust them every few minutes now is annoying, but would be sort of tolerable.  Except in the last three weeks or so, the sound quality has deteriorated too.  Specifically, they are getting more and more tinny and the volume output decreased too.  I thought maybe I was having hearing problems or it was just due to the warping of the hooks.  So I tried an old pair of Sony headphones on the same MP3 player with the same settings.  Confirmed, the Philips headphones are failing.

$REVIEW.: I'm now two weeks into a very positive experience with the Logitech Pure-Fi Elite High Performance Speaker System.  If you're of the age that remembers vinyl LPs and table sized stereo systems (not table top systems, but table sized) like me, you'll be blown away with the Logitech Pure-Fi Elite High Performance Speaker System's capacity to fill the room with rich sound!  Using your iPod as the music source, the Pure-Fi Elite almost... almost... renders the multi-disk CD player obsolete.  Play lists and genre lists give you all the flexibility that you need.  But then, that's nothing new to the iPod owner, right?Where my enthusiasm comes from is the fact that my Pure-Fi Elite System frees me from the curse of the ear buds.  I like being able to listen to my music without tuning out the world around me, a situation that my wife appreciates as well.  I considered the little speakers that can be added to an iPod, however I had yet to listen to any that provided adequate sound quality.  That's where this system excels!  The tonal quality is excellent in every room we've tried it, even outdoors (albeit with limited volume, a pleasing aspect to any neighbors).  Yes, it's light enough and portable enough to move from room to room as you please.  No, it's not truly portable in that it does not work off of batteries, so if you're a hard core mobility person you'll still need your ear buds or boom box.  Once curious design quirk in that regard is the fact that the Logitech Pure-Fi Elite High Performance Speaker System has the type of power adapter usually seen with laptop PCs.  I'm not sure why, and I'm sure that Logitech had a very good reason for using that, but maybe they can fix that with a future version.A perfect player of this sort would feature a remote control that can completely duplicate the iPod's menu capability.  Unfortunately the Logitech Pure-Fi Elite High Performance Speaker System isn't perfect in that sense.  It's good, but not ideal.  Selecting a play list is best done through the iPod itself, although you can assign your play lists to preset buttons on the remote.  That just requires a little bit of effort in the setup.The remote does however take care of the most important functions though; power, volume shuffle etc.  It also controls the AM/FM radio that is built in to the unit, which provides excellent sound reproduction although not on par with the iPod (surprise... surprise).Setup is so easy that it barely qualifies as a setup as far as I'm concerned.  And getting back to the unit's semi-portability aspect, one of the nicest design features is the considerate use of a little extra plastic to provide a holder for the remote control.  I appreciate little things like that!First and foremost though, the sound quality is excellent within it's power limits.  For party background music this will do fine.  If you want to power a dance floor, hire a DJ with some more powerful equipment.  But if you want to fill the common areas of your home with whatever music you like (in my case an eclectic collection of rock, folk, pop and classical), I would suggest that you'll be well satisfied with the Logitech Pure-Fi Elite High Performance Speaker System
$SUMMARY.: Great... it could be perfect, but I'll settle for great.

$review_text.: Nothing spectacular but I like it because it's not bulky and I can clip it to my shorts when I'm at the gym. This is my third, the clips tend not to last very long if you're like me and constantly have to pull it off/on to change songs. For the price, I like it and I don't mind replacing them every once in a while.

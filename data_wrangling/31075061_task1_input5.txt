$review_text.: I absolutely love this drive. I burned, played and erased backups of blu-ray movies on a Sony 25GB BD-RE disc a couple of times with this drive. No problems at all. I even bought a couple of HD-DVD movies and had no problems playing those too. This drive together with a nice HDMI LCD monitor will make movie watching on your computer very enjoyable. The price doesn't hit your wallet too hard either.

$review_text.: This is a good item overall, and this is my experience of it.Pros:1


Easy to write names on the CD without a problem using a sharpie.2

Good quality


(I burned one CD wrong by accident, and tried to destroy it, took some time for me to bend the CD, haha)3


CD sounds quality was satisfied.4


Burn rate of the CD was satisfied.Cons:1

If you write the name with a sharpie or a permanent marker, if you look at the shiny side of the CD, you will be able to see through it


Which terrifies me
Doesn't make the quality bad


It's just something on my side :)

I wanted an ipad2 for a new job I was starting as a Director of a Pharma company, so I wanted something that was slim and looked professional.

$REVIEW.: ...this is a fairly simple relationship:  you want a tremendous amount of storage in a quality product, this provides it.  End of analysis.  As others have stated, it does precisely what it should do, works without any hiccups, is extremely small and portable and is quick and stable.  As others have done, I too deleted the proprietary software which comes with it.It's priced relatively well here, though I will state that I was able to pick it up at my local nationally-known electronics store, on sale, for about $20 under the price listed here.Highly recommended.

$review_text.: I have owned no less then 7 Onkyo receivers over the last 12 years (i worked for a big retailer in the early 2000's).  I have used denons , Harman Kardons and random other in this time yet i keep coming back to the onkyo brand (i only go away because i like to try new products).  I have owned a few in the SR series (no network older series circa 2002-2009) and a few in the NR series the current series.I have to say that every year they upgrade their product (sometimes they are not always winners think sr 609).  I will say that Onkyos are the ugliest Receivers in the world, 2nd would be denon, they are plain and have an industrial look to them.  Better looking receivers like the HK series cost more for the same features.  So why i like and prefer Onkyos, they are cheap for what you get, i have had great experience with the customer service.  Granted i must say that it has only been for little help here or there no major problems.  The reason that i have never called about Major problems is because i have never had a major problem.  I currently have 4 onkyo receivers that work the oldest being a TX sr 501 this guy must be about 10 years old by now, it is still kicking and works great. I have a NR 616 which is pretty good , and a RC 360 similar to the NR609.now to the NR828, I got this guy a while ago and must say that this model improves on the NR616 series from a year or two ago.  The firmware is must better to start.  The power of this thing is very good, sound quality is Very good.  The video is great, i use it with a 4k sony tv and i have to say wow to the picture.  The up-scaling processor is great and one of the best in the home video products.  I have used some Inifinity Alpha series speakers (great speakers), JBL, and a few series of polk including the RTi, older RT and 75T and 65T speakers (yes i'm a nerd who loves old speakers and try to find new ones because i like to try out new products).  The sound with each of these is excellent, i prefer the Polk speakers.Pros: price for performance, quality (so far so go, i mean i have a 10 year old reciever still working why not this one), power is great for 8 ohm speakers.  The video up-scaling is best in class.  I could go on and on but i think you get the picture. on and the wifi works well.Cons: The look, man this thing is ugly you almost want to hide it (except people like me don't care as much about looks as performance.)Conclusion:  Buy one, see some bad reviews but in general this has been a great receiver for me ( as well as the older ones being just as good )  I know you can buy a sony well unless its the ES series they are not very good ( the ES is the higher priced sony), I can't find a better receiver for the money from any where or find one with discrete circuitry ( this does make a different in sound quality) that is why so many of the high end receivers are in the Thousands, the only knock on this guy is the LOOK but if you can get over that you'll have a great home receiver.

$REVIEW.: Very disappointed in this drive. I bought the version for PC & Mac, as I own both a PC and a MacBook Pro. I currently use it on my MacBook Pro and only the first few file show up on the directory of files. The majority of my files are not listed when the drive attaches, making most of my files unaccessible. I have to "Force Eject" the drive in order to eject the drive. When I attach the drive to my PC running Windows 7 all the files appear. Evidently there is a problem using tis drive with a Mac and I am disappointed that Seagate hasn't informed its customers of this fact which they MUST be aware of by now. I'd give it zero stars for Mac compatibility if I could.

$review_text.: This does exactly what I needed and causes much less strain on TV connections. Was worried side connector would be bumped or worse case snapped off as it was sticking out 3 inches. This keeps the cable very close to the TV and still allows the TV to swivel on the stand. Using two on back of TV and one on the side. Rather than have any cable stick out 2 or 3 inches these leave very little stick out thus making it much harder to be snapped off.Well made, well packaged and received very timely.

$review_text.: I ordered this router via Amazon Warehouse Deals and was excited to improve my home network and especially the speed of my internet connection since my Netgear router was a huge bottleneck.Right out of the box, I was able to set this router up behind the AT&T; UVerse router and used the WAN port on the Asus router.I set up the Asus with the DMZ Plus mode in the UVerse router. Just as I did before with my Netgear router and which is proven to work.The first thing I noticed - it only showed my wireless devices in the network map. Wired devices were not showing for quite a while and only after adding those devices via port forwarding (putting in the IP adresses manually for the port forwarding rule) forced the router to discover those devices.The device detection was working much better on the netgear and usually only took a few seconds.The next and most important problem I ran into was, that port forwarding would just not work. It worked for one of my IP cams which utilized UPNP to map the port with the router. But the port forwarding rules I set up manually would not work and I could actually see in the SysLog that the router firewall was dropping those packets.I'm giving this one more try, but I'm trending towards sending it back.

$REVIEW.: The adapter is BIG and sticks up from the iPhone, and the headset plug goes into the Monster adapter making it EVEN LONGER! Just what you don't want


As another reviewer stated, this creates a big lever

It is easy to bend this and break something


So if you leave the iphone sitting on the car seat or your desk, it's great
The nice thing about this setup is that there is only one wire to the switch/control/Microphone, but there are 2 wires to the iphone.To FIX this and get the best from both worlds, buy a short heaphone adapter cable and use that between the Monster adapter and the iPhone.I also own the Griffen and that works well also.

$review_text.: Overall, I like the case very much - protects well, edges aren't slippery but the back is (these are good things), inexpensive, comes with a stand, isn't a lint magnet, and fairly easy to install.  The only thing is, after a month or so, the silicone strip below the home button split in half.  I trimmed some of the surrounding silicone so the loose flaps wouldn't bug me - it looks a little funny since the silver edge of the iPod that now shows really stands out against the black case but its usually in my pocket so I don't notice it that often.  If it starts to bug me, I'll probably get the "Inspiretech Apple iPod Touch 2nd gen slim fit Protect Case" here at Amazon.  My 2 cents?  Stick with a hard case.

Easy bluetooth integration with iPhone, nice microphone and sound quality on the phone.  I wish it had distinct source buttons as opposed to the single source button that causes you to scroll through the options, but... that's a minor issue for me (thus keeping it at 5-star).I found the install pretty easy, but I'm not afraid of the solder gun (to install into my '02 VW, I needed a Metra 70-9003 wiring harness) and I also found a couple videos online that gave me the extra info needed.  Check out your vehicle as to what adapters, etc you may need, if any.

$review_text.: This is an odd device. I can't figure out what the intended market is. It seems less useful than a Kindle Fire or an Android tablet, and there is no cost advantage. It does a number of things, but none of them really well. And it has some major flaws. The most obvious is that it has an attached stand that does not fold or adjust and is not removable. This makes it awkward to hold and to carry. It also has a battery life of only 90 minutes, so it works best as a stationary object plugged into an outlet, but then there is no advantage to it being small and light. I found it to be convenient for watching YouTube videos and listening to internet radio, and that is probably the only way I will use it. I tried Skype, but the person with whom I was Skyping said that the picture quality was very poor, so there seems to be a problem with my camera. I also tried using it for photo slideshows, but the resolution was not very good. And finally, it has an insensitive touchscreen which requires pressure for the touch to be effective. It basically feels like old technology at a new technology price. I think there is a lot of room for improvement.

$REVIEW.: Pros:+ Very good picture quality, color accuracy for the price+ Stylish, good looking TV+ Low power consumption (lower electricity bills depending on your previous TV's power consumption)+ Wide array of picture setting options which help optimize picture quality to your liking+ USB connectivity a plus for viewing/listening to content on portable storage devices. Interface is not bad either although I don't really use this feature.Cons:- Picture quality not as great if you are viewing from an angle.  This is common of CCFL LCD panels v. LED, and is to be expected.- TV speakers have mediocre sound quality at best, a non-issue though if you are using external speakers.Overall very good TV for the money.  The only fault I could find performance-wise is that perceived picture quality deteriorated fast as you view from an angle, but it is still very watchable.  This is more a limitation of the technology at the time, and again, at this price point I really can't complain.Highly recommended this set!  Hope this review helps.

$review_text.: I needed a large capacity SADA drive for my main work computer. This drive is OEM so it did not come with cable but I already had a spare and they are pretty cheap anyway. This drive is SATA II and has a max transfer rate higher than my old SATA I capable motherboard. However, it seem to auto detect my motherboard max transfer rate and so is backwards compatible. Even with this being the case, I still went back into the computer and shorted the SATA II drive pins 5-6 which locks it into the SATA I speed of 150 MB/s. 'Better safe than sorry I always say.

$review_text.: Ok,  first off, the price is not cheap but it is OK if I did not find below problems.2nd, I did not take a star away because I can deal with the set up. Their software is not that easy to maneuver you may need to call customer service for help unless you are a computer geek. Besides their customer service is based in the Philippines and it's kind of difficult to understand because of their accents.3rd, DLink customer service acknowledged that they have problem with its 4G connectivity, meaning YOU CAN ONLY VIEW FREEZE PICTURE AND NOT VIDEO. I tried everything and it is NIL.  They said they are working on the 4G problems but since last year? Hmmmm  So, that's taken one star away.4th, if you try to monitor outside activity from behind a window. It is OK if during daylight but not at a dark environment because infrared lights will reflect on the glass and gives you the glares that completely not viewable. That's one star taken away because it doesn't serve the purpose. BTW, it is black and white video at dark environment.So, you decide.

$review_text.: These days, everybody is honestly looking for the best remote control for our everyday lives. Now, with so many people are getting more hi-tech with our devices by HDTV's, and Blu-Ray players, our older universal remotes just don't seem to cut it, and we'd have to go more hi-tech for our products, as well as our universal remote controls have to be that same way as well. Logitech though does know how to make that simplicity with universal remotes. Their Logitech Harmony One is a simple and sexy designed remote that does handle very well, without the need of placing batteries into the remote. It is rechargable by a regargeable docking station, as well as simple to program. Just plug it into your computer, and install the software. Punch in the model numbers of your favorite TV, or DVD Player into the software that you'd have to load up via your computer through the remotes software, and customize it to your styling anyway your heart desires, and just like that. You have a great remote for all your home needs.Although the price is very high, there are other Logitech remotes you can also get at a more abundant price that I definitely also recommend like the latest model, the Harmony 300. Still, if you're going to get a simple universal remote control for all your uses, I really recommend Logitech as your one and only choice for the absolute best in electronics. This remote  like all their other ones, is a couch potato's best friend.Price: B 1/2-Convience: B+Setup: B 1/2+Overall: B 1/2+

$review_text.: Absolutely shocked that for the price this antenna works amazing! Here's the short and sweet of it:Pros: Small, Compact, Lightweight, and easily concealable behind a tv or entertainment unit
As far as channels go, picked up nearly every OTA (Over the Air) digital channels available in our area.Cons: It's completely negligible considering I haven't tested a more robust/larger antenna, but in the middle of our house the signal is occasionally sparse


I'm pretty certain it wasn't the result of the antenna but rather the layout of our house
We would occasionally lose signal for a brief second, but I don't think it was the result of the antenna.In short, for the money this is an excellent antenna and well worth the purchase!

$REVIEW.: I've had this video camcorder for right around a month now and I love it!  It's small, lightweight (even with the heaviest battery), and it's very easy to use.  I began using it for recording video and taking pics, and uploading to my computer without even cracking open the instruction manual.  The zoom is huge, and the stabilization of the video is among the best that I tested out over a variety of cam makers.  Some people say taking still photos isn't that great and it's true; but it's true because the resolution of the photos are near standard definition TV and people are used to much better quality than that nowadays.  In my opinion, the still images are fine if all you have is this camera handy and you need to take a quick shot of something.  Otherwise, buy yourself a real still-photo camera!  The only other gripe I have with this camcorder is that there is no active-IR night mode and when the lighting is low the autofocus doesn't work at it's peak (as with all cameras).  Other than that though, I've been very satisfied with this camcorder and I highly recommend it!  The hard drive is huge and the heavier battery that I also bought hasn't run out on my yet!

$REVIEW.: As others have indicated, this camera is truly an exceptional value for the money

 Everything about it is of high quality from start to finsh..


even the packaging it comes in is first rate


 I love Panasonic products.When doing my research on which brand and model of networked security camera to buy, I was a little concerned about not having an IR capable camera (such as this model)
 But after reading the excellent low-lux specifications and good reviews, I took the plunge and bought 5 of these


 After using them for a month now, I'm nothing short of thrilled!With the "Color Night View" option enabled (it's turned off by default), the camera will automatically slow down the image refresh rate to compensate for low lighting conditions, which has the effect of brightening the image

 Even on dark cloudy nights I can still clearly see the area around our home and detect when anything is amiss


 The only drawback to using the Color Night View mode is that fast moving objects can appear blurred due to the slow image refresh rate
 But even with this minor shortcoming, I can still see if someone (or some critter) was moving around in the darkness on the camera's images
 However, since we have motion activated lights outside around our home, it pretty much makes that a moot point!I'm currently running all 5 of these cameras using twoTRENDnet 8-Port 10/100Mbps PoE Switcheswhich have 4 PoE ports each
 I'm recording the video feeds using the excellent i-Catcher Console software from i-Code


 Using the embedded web server in the i-Catcher software, I can monitor, operate the cameras, and playback recorded images directly on my iPhone (and it's formatted properly for the iPhone screen)
 While at work I can check up on things around my home using either my iPhone or any web browser.To get the most from these cameras, and to be able to view the video feeds over the Internet, it helps to be comfortable around computers and networking
 But if you need help, Panasonic tech support is very responsive and helpful.I've posted a daylight and nighttime image from one of my camera feeds so you can see what it looks like


 I also posted a shot of the image playback screen from my iPhone

 Look under "customer images" directly under the Amazon product photo.

$REVIEW.: The main reason I purchased this is because I do amateur video editing across two 28" screens and was tired of having to lift the mouse to be able to cross both screens w/o leaving the mouse pad. It addresses this situation very well. If you have impaired dexterity as I do you may have a problem. I have a bit of shake in my thumb which causes me some grief trying to pinpoint on a small spot. This is not the fault of the trackball at all. If I adjust the travel speed to help this problem, it takes multiple thumb strokes to travel all of the way across both screens.Note: I previously used the Logitech MX Revolution mouse (the best mouse ever made IMO) but the laser burned out and the new version did not appear nearly as good as the original so I decided to try this.

$review_text.: Make sure when you're gaming, open the SCM and enable gaming mode! For some reason, it doesn't automatically switch to the optimal settings when I play.I just got done running FRAPS in Battlefield 3 with every setting maxed out and between three runs in the same server, I averaged 73 FPS. I don't have any other graphics intensive games unless someone wants to see my averages on Crysis 1.*Edit* I just played several more rounds in different servers and my averages ranged from 63-80 FPS.I came from a 15.6" DV6-TQE with a 2630QM + HD6770 @ 1Gb DDR5. Needless to say, this is quite an improvement as far as speed goes.Longevity - The HP lasted around 5-6 hours on normal usage (browsing the web, office programs, watching videos). The GT70 will get about 3-5 hours so carry your chargers, spare battery or external battery pack with you!Screen - It's no comparison since the HP had a reflective 720p screen but this 1080p matte screen is awesome! The viewing angles are great and there is not much reflection (sunlight shines directly at the screen). Luckily, mine came with no dead pixels.Size/weight - Initially, I was apprehensive about purchasing the 17.3" version and was originally going to buy the GT60 but for $50 more, I couldn't resist and I'm happy I chose this model. My HP laptop was about 6-7lbs with the 9-cell battery upgrade and this is supposedly just under 9lbs. Holding them in my hands, I can't really feel the difference in weight between the two but there definitely is a noticeable size difference. I had (HP laptop and backpacks were stolen) this backpack:Case Logic DLBP 116 16 Inch Backpackand it, unsurprisingly, didn't fit in the laptop slot BUT it did fit into the main slot. I'm currently debating on whether or not I should purchase the same backpack or buy one designed for a 17.3" laptop.*Edit*I just bought a Case Logic RBP-117 17.3" laptop backpack and it juuuuust fits in there. It's not a tight fit nor is it a loose it. It's just a bit snug. If you click on my username, you can search for the review.Keyboard - Backlighting is awesome! Yes, there is some color bleeding but since I'm not OCD, it doesn't bother me much. The keyboard, however, is laid out a bit strangely. It's nice that the Windows button is now on the right side so that it doesn't interfere with gaming (never did on my old laptop or desktop keyboard) but the backspace, 0 and right shift button got shortened and the arrow keys are positioned in such a way that you would need to look down to place your fingers correctly or feel for the slightly larger space between the up arrow and the 1 key. My thumb usually rests right under the 1 key but now that space is used for the right arrow key. Lastly, there are two keys for the "\ |" key. The other key is to the right of the space bar and I cannot make any sense of this key.Operating system - Some people hate it, some people like/love it. I hate it and all the bloatware apps it comes pre-installed with. Apparently, Windows decided to ditch the Start Menu because a study of theirs revealed that not many people use the Start Menu key. I use it all the time and I'm quite annoyed that there isn't a factory option to boot up to the standard Windows interface. I've had to "Pin" the Command Prompt and Run programs otherwise I'd have to jump through hoops to get to them (I like having a clean desktop and taskbar). I really don't like the idea of adding on a third party program to get the Start Menu back but there's no other choice.Speakers - Not as loud as I thought given the other reviews but they're relatively loud in comparison to other laptops. My HP had a Beats by Dre sound system/speaker setup and they sounded like garbage but I've never liked any of the Beats speakers/headphones in the first place so I could be a tad bit biased here. The Dynaudio speakers are awesome though! It gives a rich sound from such small speakers.Hard drive - Slow as snail balls! $1,500 for a laptop with a 5400rpm drive? No gaming laptop should be crippled like this. It has two storage bays (this specific model), just give us a 500 or 750 GB 7200rpm drive. Most of us will be switching out to SSD's anyway (Samsung 840 Pro being ghosted).Touchpad - It would be nice to have multi-finger gestures. Scrolling down on this laptop requires you to place your finger on the far right (computer set as right handed) and drag down. On my old HP which also used Synaptecs drivers, I could scroll down using two fingers anywhere on the touchpad and swipe downward.*Edit* It wasn't working before but the multi-finger gestures are working now.Palm rest - It does not get hot at all!Noise - Quiet during normal operation and then sounds like a desktop video card with its fans on max with the turbo fan on. It's a gaming laptop, don't expect to be able to game in a library.Network card - Has better reception than my dual band Asus USB adapter (USB-N53).MSI Afterburner doesn't seem to work on this but the Turbo Fan touch button is right there so no big deal.

$review_text.: Like many people, I selected this Panasonic DMC-FP8 because it was the Consumer Reports Magazine's highest rated choice in subcompact cameras.  Also because when the Sony I purchased recently got dust on it, the lens would no longer come out of the camera.  But the Lumix's Leica lens is sealed inside the body where no dust can penetrate. You just keep the outside cover glass clean. It is as good as advertised. It has all the features anyone could want, including image stabilizer and almost 5X optical zoom.  Low light pictures are clear without flash. It turns on easily with a switch and is ready instantly.  Other cameras take a minute to get ready. There is no lag between pictures, even when I use a 4 series chip instead of the faster 6 series.  It offers face recognition, etc.  The price at Amazon was terrific.  I got the black model which was $75 cheaper than red(?) The black holster with magnetic clip is a steal at just a few dollars.

When my computer sleeps, the devices remain active so there's no reconnecting at start up. I love the dual switches.

$review_text.: I bought this as a Christmas present for my sister and brother-in-law who live many states away...  I cannot give much feedback on setting up the camera, other than my brother-in-law received the camera on one day, and we were communicating with video the next with no hitches.What I can say about this camera is that we have used Skype and MSN Messenger with my sister on the other end with this camera and the picture quality is excellent.  The difference between this camera and others that sell in the $40 - $60 range is remarkable.  Part of the reason for buying this for my sister was so that my parents could see their grandchildren on video.  The picture when hooked up to a 52 inch television was outstanding.  The audio is also very good, and picks up nicely with little background noise, if any...

$review_text.: This is such an awesome light for the price! Works off my USB on my (tested) laptop and main computer. Bright enough for all those late night PC users!My wife likes this better than her Office Depot store bought 110v plug-in light.In less than 2 months I had to replace her bulb, it cost $18.00 just for the replacement bulb!This all LED design has not gotten hot and hasn't shut down with over 2 days of continuous use. I also like the tri-power button for the low(4),medium (12) and bright (all 28) LED's on at once is also an added plus. The squeeze clip with keep this mounted almost anywhere securely! Well worth the purchase price. I think I'll buy a few more for other family members as gifts. You just can't go wrong!

Some complain about how its smudging, well of course it is as of all touch screen devices are going to get fingers prints and smudges on them. The card that comes with the product i find to be a bit short so i would recommend using a slightly larger card to apply your screen protector.A very good protector for cheap price, Highly recommended.

I use them in almost any event requiring louder noise than what the conventional laptop can provide, and the best part is that the sound quality doesn't get fuzzy at high levels of sound. I also use it as a bluetooth speaker for my cellphone and that has served my rather well too. The battery levels are really decent and I rarely have to keep on charging the device, making it very convenient for me to use and carry around.

Even though the touch cover 2 is much improved over the original touch cover, it just can't compare to type 2. I loved the idea of the touch keyboard, its thinner and lighter. I used the Touch Cover 2 for about 2 months trying to get the hang of it, but I ended up selling it. It was great for browsing the web but when I had to write paper for my class, the Type Cover 2 is the way to go. No matter how good you are with touch keybaord, you will make more mistakes with it than the type 2.

The things I dont like is that there is no screw hole on the bottom to attach to light stand.  So you need a cold shoe. Second is the power switch, which is unable to reach once flash is attached.I read some more of the reviews and for some reason I missed the reviews that said it doesnt sync to 250.  So I ran my own test and found this to be correct.  I find sync speed to be about 225.  I absolutely must have a sync of 250.  So I will return one of them and keep the other as a wireless shutter release.  It works great for that.

There are none of the typical issues that you have with wireless speakers and I've tried a few - returned all of them.Another reviewer wrote that the remote does not work as expected.  I have different results to report.  I used the remote pointed at the downstairs RoomGroove to advance to the next song when then iPod is connected to the RoomGroove upstairs.  This system could not have been designed to work better than that.On the box Klipsch chose to display these words in large bold letters:Power Detail EmotionYes, yes, and yes.  The RoomGroove absolutely delivers what it promises.FYI - I just ordered a third RoomGroove.Update 12/15/08 - I just ordered a fourth RoomGrove. Using these for "surround sound" for my home theater.  No wires.  No hassle.Update 4/17/09 - OK, I own 5 of these now: 2 upstairs, 2 downstairs, and 1 in the garage.  One of them stopped transmitting.  The other problem that I have is that transmitting a recording of the ocean, it will cut out quite often and that's very annoying.  It does not seem to do this as often playing music as it does with the ocean recording.

$REVIEW.: I've had this bag for a few years now. I is a nice bag but, the giant velcro piece on the outer flap is very noisy! This is almost always an issue since photographers are most likely shooting in places where they don't want to be noticed like weddings, events, nature, special places, nature, etc. The outer flap is the only cover for the top of the bag so, you can't place it behind since it prevents stuff from falling out or being stolen.The shoulder strap is also permanently attached to the bag and is very wide. The strap padding is also very large and not removable. It gets twisted with the strap. Since the strap has no way to rotate where it is sewn on the bag, this can be a hassle.I think all of these issues are fixable but, will Crumpler address function over form?

$review_text.: Watt or Bass junkies, stop here and look else where.Those of you looking for a well-designed, highly-versatile sound system for peronal listening in an office or small bedroom; you've come to the right place.  If it sounded bigger than it looks, then I would give it another star.  If there weren't so many all-in-one speaker systems available, then I would give it another star.  If you still listen to local radio, then it automatically gets another star.  If you will be close enough to use truly audiophile grade headphones, then it deserves another star.Let's face it, the audio market is changing with each new iteration of smartphone from Apple and Android.  I believe nothing beats a simple audio cable for connectivity and future-proofing an investment, but the bluetooth on this sounds great with both most devices.When thinking of purchasing this product, ignore the speaker specs.  Focus on the receiver and it's feature set.  If the list looks right for you, then most likely you will give it five stars.  Unfortunately, though the list looked right for me, my wife disagreed.

DO NOT install the CD software or drivers2


make sure you have the &#34;WLAN AutoConfig&#34; service set up to run &#34;Automatically&#34; and that you start it up.3


plug the thing in a usb port - preferrably one of the higher ones above ground4

Add a network, etc....However,&#62;The thing is slow, and keeps dropping connections every now and then.&#62;With wired internet I have connection speeds up to 21 Mbps...with this device it is a maximum of 4.3 MbpsAlso:Do not let all the 5 star reviews on Amazon for this device (or any other product) fool you - many are paid for
However there are ways to detect that

E.g
if you see many many negative reviews, and then suddenly a batch of 20 5 star review, you can be sure they were bought for reviews

Just because these &#34;professional&#34; reviewers have lots of other reviews, does not mean they are not paid for, as a matter of fact, their companies are paid a lot of money to &#34;fix&#34; the image of many many products.

$review_text.: I've been wanting something like this for a long time.  GoGoGate, finally gets it right (mostly).Installation may or may not be easy depending on your skill level as well as unique conditions of your garage.  The instructions include a YouTube video that's really easy to follow and for most situations everything will be fine.  However, as you're reading the instructions or watching the video, pay attention to what they are doing and why.  It's understandable that they can't give instructions for every unique situation, so understand what they are demonstrating and use common sense to apply it to your own garage.My (3 car door) garage has the wall buttons nowhere near a power outlet. My wife wouldn't appreciate the controller and the wires being placed near the buttons anyway.  So for me the easy solution was to mount the GoGoGate on the ceiling next to one of the opener motors.  That allowed me to run wires to each of the 3 motors going through the ceiling and into the attic.  Other than the GoGoGate device being visible behind one of the motors, the entire system is hidden.My motor had 4 wires going to it, not 2 (one red one white) like in the instructions.  No problem, the GoGoGate is just a switch it completes or breaks a circuit.  All I had to do was find which of the two wire connections when connected would open the door (the other two were for the lights).The other issue I had was in placing the 3 sensors.  That was hard in my case because there was a metal rail between the doors and the wall.  This meant putting the sensor on the very top of the garage door and doing the opposite of what they suggest, that is the big piece needs to go on the door, and the smaller piece on the wall.  It took some playing around, but it was really easy to figure this out.The double-sided tape to secure the sensors works well if you make sure to clean the surfaces, and don't touch them (oil from your fingers will be a problem).  Then when securing, hold the sensors down firmly for 30 seconds (no wiggling).  Before doing this, tape your sensors in place to make sure they're going to work where you're placing them (with painter's masking tape).  You can't re-use the double sided tape.Make sure to remove the protective film over the phone light sensor before doing the set up.  Otherwise it won't work.  That film should have a notice on it, and I think that's causing a lot of problems.  On the other hand, you don't need to use the phone light sensor.  Follow the instructions and just go to "Find GoGoGate".  The first time you do this, you need to create an open wifi network with your router, but once you've set up GoGoGate to recognize your SSID and password, you're good to go.  Subsequent configurations and changes will work work without having to open your wifi.  For me this is easier than doing the phone light sensor syncing because I need to move a car and get a ladder to get to where I mounted the device.If your SSID has special characters it won't work with the GoGoGate, but that's exactly why your SSID shouldn't have special characters.  Do yourself a favor and don't use special characters in an SSID, you'll appreciate this later when setting up the Internet of everything.Room for improvements:1) Both pieces of the sensor should have holes for securing it with screws.  Currently only the small piece has these holes.2) The "Warranty Void if Removed" sticker is placed in such a way that it broke (95%) on mine simply during shipping and handling.3) The app has a funky web browser inside of the app.  This is better than sending you to Mobile Safari, but it clearly not the same user experience as the native app section.  I'd like to see this better integrated.  One major improvement would be to remove the pop-up that asks you to open the web page.  Instead, just open the web page.  Put the website address in the Settings part of the app.4) Alerts:  It's great being able to get an alert.  My wife used to forget to close the garage door sometimes.  This lets me know this is happening.  I'd like to be able to configure it so that alerts keep coming unless turned off by the app itself.

$REVIEW.: So this works well as a diffuser, if you figure out this one obnoxious trick. When I put this on my Canon t3i all the way, it thinks there is a flash inserted and will not raise or use the pop-up flash, even if you've already popped it up. The only way I've found to get around this, since the settings wont let you change them, is to only put the diffuser on 1/3 of the way leaving a majority of it hanging off. It's not terribly secure but it works. The key is for it to not cover the larger sensor on the top of the part you attach it to. So it works....but there's an issue you should be aware of.

$review_text.: We have had a Panasonic one similar to this that we loved


As a matter of fact, we just used our old cords to hook the new one up


It was very user-friendly to program and has all the great features we enjoyed in out old model.Of course it can play all the usual media: Blu-Ray, DVDs, CDs, SDs, etc
3D can be used with specified cable and TV
It is fairly compact, so it is not very clunky and comes with a remote as you would expect.Up to 4 individuals can customize their settings


With the Viera connect, you can enjoy online media via Netflix, Hulu etc.We feel like this is a great machine at a decent price from a brand that we have come to trust.

$REVIEW.: I just received this reader today, so I can't comment on it's longevity, but I am so far VERY impressed

I just transferred two HD video files (.mts) with it

One was about 2 GB, the other 120 MB - both transfered with no problems, and blazingly fast
No setup at all involved, just pop in the reader, stick it in your USB drive (I used a USB hub, and it was still very fast), and you can read your card like any regular USB drive
I'm on a Windows 7 machine.I did a good amount of research before deciding on this reader, and was almost set on theSandisk MicroMate Reader - for SD and SDHC memory cardsbefore finding this one
I was put off by the high price of the Sandisk MicroMate ($20), but at the same time, I trusted the brand

I have never used a Transcend product, and the $2 price tag seemed way to good to be true, but I figured it's $2, there's very little to lose.I was very suspicious of the $2 price tag, but the reviews on here assuaged me to try the product
The same happened to me, and I'm very impressed and happy with Transcend's card reader

I have no idea how Transcend can afford to offer this for such an absurdly low price

I'm thinking I should have ordered a few more just to keep around since it's such a steal right now
It does exactly what I wanted a $20 card reader to do.

$REVIEW.: I write this review not as a gamer but as a 110 words-per-minute humble-bragging typist.  I love every aspect of this keyboard - the look, the feel of the keys - but none so much as the clicking sound.  The clicking sound is unreasonably satisfying to listen to, whether you're hammering out a long e-mail or just doing a quick Google search.  It will make you feel like a fitter, happier, more productive human being.  It will make your boss give you a raise because you'll sound like you are working harder.  It will put your co-workers on notice because, hey, you've got a G710+, you know what you're doing.  It will increase your nerd cred with your friends.  It will make the ladies huddle close and seductively whisper &#34;Cherry MX Brown&#34; in your ear.Quit waffling and buy it already.

$REVIEW.: I bought this keyboard shortly after switching to an iMac, because I needed a number pad for data entry. I was happy with the design and build quality of Apple's included wireless keyboard, so I was wary of a third party option, but decided to give this a try. I have been very happy with my choice. This keyboard is aesthetically appealing, and matches well with the aluminum design scheme of the iMac. I do wish the body of it were actually aluminum, but not enough for it to bother me. The keys are very responsive, typing on it is fairly comfortable, and everything just works well. I LOVE the fact that it is solar powered as well, because I am never having to change out batteries like I have to in my mouse. I'm in a home office by a window, and it always has enough light to stay charged. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone who wants to keep the simple design elements associated with Apple but needs the functionality of a full size keyboard.

I can't tell the difference between 128 kbps and 160 kbps MP3s.For people like me, these headphones are perfect. They're simple and they work.Yes, the earbuds are a little hard in terms of the plastic, but they don't hurt my ears (I guess they're the right shape), and they're not the annoying kind that have one headphone line longer than the other.For less than $6, you can't really go wrong with these.

$review_text.: The Logitek Lapdesk is a great accessory for anyone that does a lot of computing from the living room. The angle produced by the bend is perfect for sitting comfortably on the sofa and browsing the web or even typing up a document. The padding is covered in the same cloth that a lot of high-end, high-use office chairs use. This allows your legs to breath and doesn't get your pants sticky with sweat during long-term use.The only down-side is the shiny top of the desk. While this makes the desk more attractive, it also ensures that you need a mouse pad if you are going to use the desk with a netbook and mouse. The desk isn't big enough for a full size laptop and mouse pad, however, so even having room for the mouse with the netbook could be seen as a positive.The lapdesk is much better than just holding the netbook in your lap or even using a small table. I'll be using it from now an whenever I need to use my netbook in other rooms of my house.

$REVIEW.: I have two sets of these headphones - one has been my companion in my gym bag for about 15 years, and the other has gone traveling with me over many trips in my computer bag as well as used frequently at home.I probably have a dozen pair of good to excellent headphones, including various sennheisers, grado sr 60, shure, super.fi pro 6, sony mdr v6 and v300, etc.Honestly these Porta Pros do not offer the best sound quality in the world

 But they might be the most comfortable
 And the sound quality is pretty darned good with excellent bass for a headphone so small
 They are easy to carry around, and I have found them to be surprisingly durable.By comparison I also have the Sennheiser PX 100s


 The Sennheisers are OK, but not as comfortable and the sound is more muffled


 I always go back to the Porta Pros
 In fact, no matter what ever headphones I try I always go back to the Porta Pros.These have been around a long time, but no one has yet made a better portable headset


 Usually I don't like to jump in with a me too review when there are this many people who have already written a review


 But these headphones are that good, and I recommend them to anyone with an ipod or other mp3 player.

$REVIEW.: I owned my last computer speakers for about 10 years, so it's been a long time since I've been in the market. I was pleasantly surprised to find these, which were inexpensive and obviously well-reviewed.Set-up was simple and the sound quality is terrific. It provides a really nice range of sound, and can get plenty loud. However, on day two, I noticed that my left speaker kept cutting out. After a little investigation, I realized that when I lifted up the control unit, if I held the wire *just so,* the speaker was fine-- so it was obviously a wire connection that wasn't working. I debated what to do... I had already thrown out my old speakers as soon as I saw that the new ones were working the previous day, so if I boxed these up to return them to Amazon, I would have had no speakers at all while I waited for a replacement. No good!So I wrote to Cyber Acoustics and asked them about their return policy. I showed them my receipt, and they apologized for the problem and sent me out a new control pod immediately, without making me return the defective one.The speakers look and sound great. There are two remaining minor problems: first, they're top-heavy-- the base isn't adequate, so if you move things around on your desk, they fall over a lot! I keep accidentally knocking them over, which is annoying. I'm thinking of Velcroing them to the desk! Second, the control pod looks cool with its blue glowing circle, but it's just one more thing to have to keep on my desk. My last speakers had volume knobs built in, which I preferred.Still 5 stars for value and sound (and good customer service).

$review_text.: So not much to review here.It's not a work or not work thing you can know. It simply will either protect you or it won't... Hopefully I never have to find out :)My only few complaints on this is the ground wire is short, though that should be the case, you always want things as short as possible.The other is the included patch cable. Very very short and does not really say if you MUST use that one or can use your own.Most would think just use your own but this is a special cable. It has metal inside it separating 4 of the 8 wires apart all the way up to and into the plug end itself which is probably to help prevent a surge or anything from jumping across wires to further add additional protection but at this short range it wasn't useful for me because I had to ground mine to an outlet and thus couldn't use the cable to reach my router.Overall if it had a longer provided patch cable or at least option to buy longer ones that feature the metal ground inside it would be even better.Will it still function and provide some protection using your own wire? I am not 100% sure but I imagine so as long as you are properly grounded, I think this was just additional protection and quality provided.That being said would I buy again? Yup, problem is a lot of back batteries only have 100Mb protection, I wanted 1Gb so this was my purchase!

$review_text.: I carry lots of "stuff" on my smartphone, which I increasingly use as a replacement for a laptop. (The Sprint HTC Evo 4G with a wireless keyboard is a fantastic combination. Smartphones and convergence are actually happening.)Usually I upload files that I might need to the "cloud" or email them to myself.But for music, movies and other voluminous masses of data, I use a USB cable - which I often don't have with me in the field.Enter this handy little gizmo, the SanDisk SDDR-121-A11M MobileMate Micro Memory Card Reader. Take my microSDHC card out of the smartphone, pop it into this gadget and plug it into a USB connector. That's all there is to it. Works like a charm without hassles.It is a lot more convenient than the SD card sized adapters because it has a lanyard and will fit on a key ring.Build quality is adequate and I do anticipate having to replace it somewhere down the line. A small price to pay for the convience.If you have a smartphone, MP3 player or other gadget using a microSDHC card that you want to transfer data to or from, this is literally the perfect solution.Jerry

If you order a case be sure that you check that the name  and number  size are  correct

 There are galaxy  note 2, and note 3 and those each are so many sizes that t is a nightmare

I have an Apple keyboard, a mouse and a flash drive
The two USB slots that are facing up are the powered slots that can be used to charge devices


One is charging my iPhone and the other is charging a Bluetooth speaker.I don't have a USB 3.0 on this PC right now, but this hub will be ready by the time I change to a PC with the faster USB ports
USB 3.0 is about 3.5 times faster in real-world (10 times on paper).The hub has its own 100-240v power brick so you can use it to charge your devices even the PC is off

$review_text.: These are really good screen protectors. They go on great using the scotch tape method (A couple pieces of tape to keep things aligned before you peel and apply - look it up), and there are no bubbles at all. The cutouts are also good, but there is one major drawback with the cutouts. Might not be an issue on the black phone, but if you havea white iPhone like I do, the screen protector does cover the proximity sensor and this prevents the proximity sensor from functioning. The solution is to cut the hole yourself, which is a rather annoying process, but certianly not impossible.For the price, these are great, and if not for that one problem with the proximity sensor being covered, they would be 5 stars for sure, because everything else is perfect.

$review_text.: I purchased the Clearstream 2 to replace an older DB8 and wanted to share my experience.The DB8 was bought a couple of years ago as the US was moving to a digital and I wanted to move away from my Direct TV satellite that could only deliver a low-def picture because of the trees and really didn't work when there was wind /rain / snow etc . The DB8 is a large UHF only antenna that I found quite difficult to point at New York but after some trial and error it pulled in 40+ channels of high def content. I was very pleased - except for the size of the antenna which as I said is large and is also not that attractive.When the analogue to digital transistion happened I lost ABC which moved back from the UHF frequency it was testing at to a High VHF frequency. Irritating. I then bought a RCA ANT751R VHF/UHF antenna that I mounted alongside the DB8. Between the two I now receive the High VHF and UHF channels. I still lost some channels in bad weather but overall pretty good. A little while later I bought another RCA (they are compact and do do a good job) and pointed that at Long Island to get some other channels. I amplify the signal at the roof using a PA18 pre-amplifier for the DB8 and a Radio Shack amplifier for the RCA.Fast forward to this year and I noticed that Antenna Direct had some new antennas coming out that I thought would be better (DB2e, DB4e). I have no experience of these antennas so cant comment on their performance but I decided not to try them as they are still quite large.So, I then decided to try the Clearstream 2. It arrived quickly from Amazon in a remarkably small box. On unpacking I noticed that it hadn't been assembled properly (the hole that the antenna cable was at the top of the antenna and not at the bottom), but this was a 2 minute easy fix with a screwdriver. Swopping the DB8 for the CS2 was also quite easy as the hard work of positioning the antenna on top of the roof was already done.For me the CS2 pulls in as many channels as the DB8 and is visually much better. The antenna is much much smaller, is easier to point (the DB8 was quite directional, the CS2 just needs to be pointed in the general direction and has a broad angle of reception which means for me that I was able to remove one of the RCAs by pointing the CS2 between the direction of the RCA and the direction of the old DB8. The antenna seems also to better equiped for bad weather (being smaller and mounted to a fairly sturdy mount helps) and so far we haven't had issues. In fact during last week's storm the CS2 survived unharmed but the RCA was damaged by a falling tree branch.The CS2 does not replace the RCA used to receive the ABC VHF channel, but otherwise this antenna is simply excellent. Cheaper than the DB8, much smaller and much more attractive.I'll wait for reviews of the DB2e and DB4e but I think I have finished experimenting with antennas as the CS2 and RCA between them do a great job.

It does its job maintaining cool temperatures for a I5-3570K and does it quietly even underload mostly gaming.Installation was easy enough. The manual has detailed diagrams and simple worded instructions. I had to buy a new case in order to install the radiator and fan but this is bad planning on my part. If your case can mount 120 mm fan/s towards the rear you can install this cooler.

$review_text.: I purchased this item to keep in our car and use only when there is a traffic tie-up on the freeways.  In the past, we had several times where the interstate came to a complete halt and we encountered nearly an hour delay each time.  With a CB you can hear the truckers coming from the other direction explaining what happened and how long the backup might be.  This unit is relatively small and the short antenna seems to provide pretty decent reception. The whole thing can fit in a cupholder!  If you really needed to transmit with more range you could buy (for about $4) a BNC to SO239 adapter and use a standard CB antenna with this unit.The only thing that surprised me, though, was how the display blanks out if the squelch is turned up.  I never had a CB that did this.  When I first powered it up the display showed a 9 and immediately went out.  I thought the unit had burned up because there was no sound or display.  However I discovered (by trial and error) that turning the squelch all the way down restored the display and resulted in background noise.  As soon as you use the squelch to cut out the background noise the channel display goes out until a broadcast is received.I don't think there is a better CB available for the money.

$REVIEW.: I got an Ipad early for Christmas.  Of course I had to use it right away and day one it is laying on my big arm chair and my little long haired chihuahua comes and jumps on the chair and down the ipad goes to the floor.  It was not damaged and did not break but I decided to search for a cover.  Apples cover that was bought with it flopped open when it dropped so that cover is really useless.Back to this cover.  At first I didn't like it.  It had no instruction but I thought hey, just follow the hole openings on the ipad and it will fit.  But I left the foam insert in the cover and it was way tight.  I realized since the camera hole was not showing that that insert is to be discarded.  I don't really know why that big foam pad with a hole in the middle is in the case.  There is a magnet that closes the cover and puts the ipad to sleep.I don't really get the idea of the handle.  It seems out of place somehow.  If I wanted to use a handle it would be to carry it not to hold it in my lap.  When I did try to use the handle to hold the ipad my diamond wedding set got hung up and I nearly dropped the ipad. My advice is if you use the handle and wear jewelery be careful.  On the plus side of the case I feel much better having it on the Ipad because I can put it in my purse don't fear the screen getting scratched.  As I later learned no scratches but a broken glass caused by my dropping it an an inferior cover.UPDATE:Yes, I dropped the ipad and the screen broke in the top right corner.  I returned it to apple care for repair and that is a whole other story.  I have purchased an otterbox for the ipad since I know I can and will drop it. Had I have done what a friend recommended which is buy the otterbox I would not be out $250.00.  This case was no protection in this instance.  Here is the story on the apple care repair center.I go to apple care and they say it is under warranty but I really didn't buy that at all. And I was right. Here are the steps for repair. You try and navigate the apple care site, get a repair id, take the ipad to UPS Store and they wrap it and send it overnight to Apple. Apple gets it and says, oh it is damaged with a cracked screen and you must pay $241.77 for us to repair. I say ok. I go online and pay the $241.77 to repair the glass. They send another email a couple days later and say we didn't hear from you so we shipped it back unrepaired. I call apple care. They say, we see the emails and the payment we don't know what happened but let me connect you to a supervisor who can suggest a couple things. After being on the phone 20 minutes with them they have the dude call me back and he says, I don't think I can intercept the ipad but if you will send it back we will repair it. I said look, I already had to drive 10 miles to a UPS store and paid $241.77 only to be told it was returned unrepaired. There was no solution offered to me only that I could call this manager back. I said for what. You had your chance and I am disgruntled with apple and expected a whole lot more from Apple. The moral to this story is forget their repair center. IT STINKS! I understand my town has a company that repairs for the same amount with a two hour wait. That would have been a lot easier.

$REVIEW.: It works just fine with my 2GB Western Digital hard drive and my new Mac Mini (which is one of the few Macs so far to offer USB 3.0)


But I can't say I'm thrilled with the quality


My smart drive case arrived with the small plastic piece (that covers the front light) loose and rattling around inside

I was able to carefully wedge it back into position


The exterior case is mainly aluminum, but the front and back of the case are plastic, as are the interior surfaces to which your hard drive attaches

I'm used to hard drive cases that are all aluminum and show much better quality control, but to be fair, they cost twice what this one does


I bought this one, because with new 2 or 3 TB USB 3.0 external drives going for not much over $100, it's hard to justify the economics of an expensive external enclosure

This Mediasonic enclosure works, the on-off switch is a plus, and it's worth the $29.99 I paid for it


 If I'd shelled out much more, I'd have had higher expectations.UPDATE: The product has served me well enough that I actually ordered a second one


No loose pieces on this one, and no problems


Definitely worth the money

(And I corrected a typo to change GB to TB, per a comment that was offered.)

$review_text.: Let me start by saying that I HAVE NOT used this yet and will revise if the product doesn't function as it should (in late November/early December 2011 when I return from vacation).This item is VERY heavy...I think my iPad weighs less with it's case! With the weight restrictions imposed in carry-on luggage internationally, it may be an issue. I tried this out on plugs that will be in Germany and everything fits snugly. I also plugged it into the outlet at home (US), and it did not sag in the outlet. All electronics that I will be bringing fit perfectly in the sockets. The only thing left is for me to try it in Germany in November! Product is well-packaged and is simple to figure out.Edit update: okay, so I went to Germany and tested this thing out. Perfect! I didn't have any hair dryers or high wattage items, but did plug an oldish phone into the outlet and it charged up just fine. I actually left it with the hotel I stayed in to benefit other travelers because I truthfully didn't need to convert anything with my iPad and iPhone...I just needed plug adapters for the journey. Good little item at a reasonable price, however. I would definitely recommend this if you have low wattage older electronics that you would like to not blow up. ;)

Cost to sound ratio simply does not get any better than this.One minor con:  the terminals don't make for an easy setup with banana plugs if hung from the wall..

in fact, it's impossible if you're mounting the speakers directly to the wall instead of a mounting plate or shelf


 But of course this isn't a big deal at all.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this item specifically for my HTC EVO Shift.  It greatly increased the capacity and allows me to take endless pictures and videos.  However, navigating from one screen to another all of a sudden took forever and for the first time I started getting the "waiting" message as it navigated from screen to screen.  I thought that maybe because it was only a class 4 card, did I need something faster?  Did I go to big?  Should I go back down to maybe an 8GB?  All of my fears were squashed when HTC came out with an update.  I'm not sure what really got updated, but it's as fast as when it was new.  There's no more waiting when I navigate from screen to screen, it just does it.  So the card works fine. Most likely, the card was never the issue.  I also use one of the in my VuPoint wand scanner.  No issues there, scans are fast and instant.  I scanned a whole book and it seems like I'll never fill up the card.For the price I picked it up at, I definitely recommend one.
$SUMMARY.: Slow at first - but HTCs fault, now everything's good.

$review_text.: I consider myself a middle-of-the-road computer user, and have been looking for something to back up important files at a low cost for a while now.As far as storage goes, the Seagate Backup Plus works fine. It's cheaper than buying the equivalent amount of memory in memory sticks, so that's a plus.But it's not the easiest system to use. First, several additional programs had to be installed on my machine before I could even set it up. This annoys me--I have an older computer and like to keep the clutter to a minimum. Plus, it took quite a while for all that stuff to download/install/reboot.Second, the "instruction manual" was an utter joke, explaining how to plug it into the computer, but nothing else (maybe also something about the warranty--I don't have it in front of me, but it didn't add anything helpful).The box says you don't need to install the dashboard software to use it, but I had to. Again, annoying. The default option is continuous backup, which again--annoying. Most people don't need that, and it slows things down considerably. And in any case, I can't get any sort of scheduled backup to work. I could probably figure it out, but it's easier just to remind myself to back up stuff once in a while. The really important files I need to back up don't change all that often.

 The cleaning bit that you rub on the glass seems flimsy as well

 I'm seeing small bits and pieces of the circular pad rubbing off and I have to use the rocket air to blow all of the dirt (I can't use the brush because it would leave more smudges!)Overall the cleaning is good after the whole process but it just doesn't seem as efficient as it could be .

$review_text.: I'm writing this review after owning my iAudio 7 for a couple of years and I've got some pretty serious gripes about the cheap material this thing is made out of, the glitchy firmware and the problems this creates over time. Most of the reviews for this product are positive because they are written while the device is brand new. The problems I encountered in terms of the iAudio 7's physical quality could be easily fixed. I really hope Cowon addresses these issues because this could be one of the best MP3 players ever made if it always worked like it was supposed to.First, the screen cover cracked because it's just thin cheap plastic. I wasn't too upset about this, I could still see the screen for the most part. Not long after that, the buttons on the top stopped working one-by-one. When I sent it in (still under warrantly, I had to pay for the shipping) Cowon demanded that I pay for the repairs to the buttons and I had to argue with this guy for an hour to get it repaired. It took over a month to get it back.In addition to the physical problems with this device, how ever they index the files on it messes up regularly. Songs are consistently out of order and albums are often split into two or more listings. Sometimes songs don't even show up even though they show up in the directory. If you add new songs and it re-indexes, the songs that didn't show up before show up but then other songs do not. This device also freezes intermittently and takes a very long time to boot up after adding new songs. At the time of writing this review, I am using the most current firmware and these problems persist.Also battery life, while very good, is not as advertised.There are positive aspects of this device (covered in other reviews), but for me the problems have overshadowed the features.

$REVIEW.: Compared to the Hero 2 I have this camera has some advantages.First among them is battery life. This is a drastic improvement over my Hero2, even with the battery backpak. It is also a bit smaller and lighter. The lens is a bit of an improvement in areas like near object sharpness. The new video modes for HD don't really impress me as the frame rate drops to get them. I find the color to be superior to the Hero2, it's quite a bit more vivid, without looking fake.  It's also far superior to the Hero2 in low-light shooting. WiFi is an &#34;upgrade&#34; of sorts from the Hero2. It isn't a simple setup and it drains the battery quickly and doesn't have a very long range. The close stills are as good as my HTC phone, not as good as my iPhone 5.  Sound capture was very good, I found it clearer than the Hero2.The major con for me is that objects about 8-10 feet away are blurred. I find this unacceptable for action video as the background is as important to me as the foreground. The still shots suffer from this as would be expected.The camera is constructed every bit as solid as the Hero2. I would still expect to use bacpak batteries for longer shoots.Also, all my shooting was done on fast, high quality class 10 SD cards.  Don't cheap out here or you will definitely be unsatisfied with the video!Overall, it's a decent camera for the price, the blurring of slighlty distant objects may not bother others as it does me, so I can't not recommend it based on that.  The near objects are very crisp.  However, if the budget allows, I would look at the Hero3+ Black Edition and compare.

$REVIEW.: I have been using this device for a long time, so I feel qualified to go through the ins and outs. If your reason for looking at this is the same as mine, which it probably is, you are looking for a cost effective way to extend a wireless signal from your router that is either too weak or does not cover your full home.SITUATIONI use an Apple wireless router in an 1800 square foot home. The issue is that the Internet connection comes in at a corner of the house, which is very poor planning. If it were in the middle of the house, I would not have bought this device, as the radius would easily cover the whole house. Instead, I send a range to my neighbor even though he can't use it. Roughly 500 square feet of my house has awful signal due to this. I needed something that could reach living room devices, an Xbox, and wireless security cameras at the other end of the home.PROSSetting this device up is a snap. It syncs quickly and gets signal quickly. It is obviously $30, so I was concerned even about this simple concept. When the device has connection, it transmits a solid signal of its own and hands off to the Apple router very well. My Xbox can maintain three bars for online game play. Streaming videos lags a little, but not significantly.CONSThe device, like many extenders, does not truly amplify your current signal. It essentially creates a new network (in layman's terms) that connects to your original. This creates a big problem. If your network is under the SSID ACME, then the Edimax creates a new SSID called ACME001. Any device you have can ONLY connect to one SSID at a time. It typically will not switch SSIDs unless it completely loses the original signal, even if a stronger signal that you have authorized is closer (at least not Apple). I think you see where I am going now. So if I am in one room when I arrive and it attaches to ACME001, it will not let it go, even if I am standing next to the actual router with a super signal on ACME as long as it can even barely see ACME001. This is a big problem because it is slow and it is relaying off an inferior device to get to the original connection. The other issue is that the device periodically stops transmitting to the original. I am not sure if this is due to being idle or a technical problem, but you have to turn it off, wait a few seconds, and then turn it back on. I have to do this fairly regularly. It is still showing in your networks and you are connected, but it is not relaying data anymore. You do not know this until you try to do something online.CONCLUSIONThis is a $30 device. Keep that in mind. I feel that you get more than $30 value out of the device, even with these negatives. I simply work around them as needed and most of my family does not seem to notice or care (although my young son knows to reset it when he needs to go on the Xbox).  In the long run, I think anyone, including me, needs something better. It just can not be consistent to be a powerful tool. For the price though and quick fix, I am not sure it can be beat.
$SUMMARY.: A great value...If your expectations are right

I am happy with them


I have used my surround sound system everyday (literally) since installing them and I like to feel my movies and video games I play (I like the volume way high)and so far no problems and am in fact still satisfied almost 1 year later
The only reason that I gave these a 4 star instead of a five is that I'm sure there are better out there (actually though even if I found them and paid the premium price) but I'm sure that I could not hear the difference personally although some total audiophile might be able to.

$REVIEW.: This remote is very easy to program through Harmony's (Logitech) web site


 However, I ran into some minor glitches with certain controls in the "activities" functions when watching a movie or playing a CD, mainly that the "hard keys" (previous track and next track) would not work properly

 It wasn't that the remote didn't understand them (they would work when I specifically asked to control my Yamaha DVD-CD Player) it's just that they weren't preset correctly.Also, if you use your original remotes as well (for example, for your TV), then this could make for some confusing use, since the control "memorizes" what it did last (for example if you were watching a movie and used the original TV remote to change your TV's source back to cable TV, when you selected "Watch TV" on the Harmony, it would change your source, thinking it was still using one of your line ins.Other than that a fantastic product.

 I would strongly recommend everyone to return their rental modem to TWC (unless you enjoy donating money to a bullying monopolistic corporation)
 it's not that hard, it just takes about 2 hours


 buy this modem, call up TWC, tell them you want to hook up your own modem and return their leased modem, and they'll walk you trhough teh steps and hook you up to the internet with the new modem
 the hardest part is returning the leased modem, because they MAKE you drop it off in person at the store, and it's like being at the DMV


 i kid you not

$review_text.: This was one of the only well reviewed cases I found for my first generation iPad. I recieved the product and found that  it was black leather rather than the brown pictured. The bezel around the screen when the iPad is on the case raises up, which doesn't do anything negative, except make the product look used or worn. The iPad sits well in the case and has various slits to adjust the angle, however, there is a little too much wiggle room in the case. This makes it so the iPad can slip a little too far down, resulting in a little bit of the bottom of the screen being covered up.Now onto the goods:The  keyboard is very nice and  easily connects via bluetooth. With waterproof keys there is no worry about spilling or cleaning. However, this silicone keyboard does lend to an interesting feel that is somewhere in between squishy and tactile. All I have to say is that it takes a bit of getting used to, but that's it. It has great battery  life and shortcuts for iPad specific functions, and near complete lack  of the typical  clacking sound.This is a very nice looking case with  a plush leather feel, it will also fit the newer iPads, I just hope they change the picture for future buyers.

$REVIEW.: I had a lot of trouble applying this screen protector.  No matter how slowly I went, I still got tons of bubbles.  Very frustrating.  I am hoping over time they will smooth out.  The good:  The screen protector really does not show fingerprints.  That I really like.  When the Ipad is on, you really don't see the bubbles but it still bugs me they are there.  There is no smoother to try to minimize them (like those plastic scrapers you get when you buy other screen protectors for ipod and phones).  If I could minimize more bubbles, I'd be really thrilled with this protector because it really doesn't show fingerprints.  I watched the youtube video on how to apply but still got bubbles.

$REVIEW.: I've used this multiple times to steam vegetables or even steamers (a type of shellfish) for dinner.  I also use the bottom pot for making anything I would normally do in a pot.  The size is convenient for a family of 4 or to augment the average kitchen.  So far it feels very sturdy (as Farberware tends to be) and is surviving my working kitchen (and dishwasher requirements for all my cookware).

$review_text.: It's hard not to give the ZN9 solid ratings, if only because the number of products that can compete with it is so limited.  I went out specifically looking for an alarm clock that could work with my original Zune 30, and I was unable to find anything else that fit the bill.  Specifically, all I really wanted was something that would allow me to wake up to music on my Zune with an alarm, and the ZN9 does the job adequately.The only big weaknesses would be the sound quality, which is just mediocre.  However, the inclusion of both AM and FM radio is fantastic, and it was incredibly easy to use and set up.  Having two alarms is also incredibly useful.  Honestly, I don't have any complaints other then the fairly steep price, but again since there isn't much else out there I'm not sure what else I could recommend anyway.Overall, it's a solid alarm clock with some cool extras that aren't found often.

$REVIEW.: I purchased the Nuvi 1350 when my old Garmin IQM5 GPS/PDA combo started getting glitchy.  I'm very pleased with the unit, for the price.  The screen is clear and easy to read, it finds the satellites quicky, it recalculates almost immediately, the voice is better and clearer than on a more pricey model that I tried, and its very easy to set up and start using.It's worth going on-line and reading the manual (it only comes with a quick-start guide), as there were a few features that I couldn't figure out myself, and other features that I wasn't even aware of until I read the manual.I was lucky that one of my camera cords fit the Nuvi, so I didn't have to purchase a USB cord.  Not including a cord is very cheesy on Garmin's part. I called Garmin to be sure that I could use the camera cord, and customer support was very helpful. The unit fit right into the case that I already had from my IQM5The pre-loaded Favorites are very complete and well organized.  One of my complaints, however, is that there's no way to add your own address, then place it into a "Favorites" category.  You have to choose a pre-loaded location to get it into a category, otherwise your location just gets lumped into the main Favorites menu.You probably need a more pricey unit to get more options.I've also found some mistakes in the maps, and a very glaring typo in the name of a pre-loaded favorite, and there's no way to edit this.  Again,you'll probably get more advanced editing features with a more expensive unit.  There is a "detour" feature and a way to add via points, but not a way to save routes in advance of your trip.  I like the turn feature, which lets you see at a glance whether your next turn will be right or left.  I also like that you can turn off the GPS to save the battery when you're looking at a route indoors.  There's also a pedestrian mode and a bike mode, which makes the unit more flexible.I had tried a much more expensive Garmin that had the traffic updates, and didn't like that feature at all. It was very inaccurate and not very useful. I think that's only helpful in metropolitan areas. I don't think its worth the extra money.For a fairly sophisticated GPS that will get you where you want to go, at a really nice price, I'm quite satisfied with the Nuvi 1350.

$review_text.: One biggest gripe with Nintendo is that it does not support a HDMI connector (not asking for 1080P, just a simple connector). There are too many on the market. I was simply looking for something that Amazon sells directly. Since I did not find one, the next best option was a Fulfilled-by-Amazon (same return policy, makes life easier). I got this based on the reviews I read. Got it on Tuesday, plugged it and did not work. I was like "damn". I looked in the back and tried to push it in, and it went further in and a had a blue light glowing. The video and audio then started working immediately. A sigh of relief. Remember that it does not come with an HDMI cable, so buy one if you don't want to be disappointed. Also, remember to switch to 480P on your Wii. Definitely helps reducing the number of cables I have to get thro the small hole we have on our TV stand.

$REVIEW.: I am using this in a Sony HX300 and so far it has worked very well, although there is definite room for improvement.As I have seen around, many people stressed following the included set up guide. So I did and things went smoothly. Things need to be done in sequence during the initial setup, thus I can see why people stress folloing the guide. It's not simple plug and play.I set up the card to use the internet mode by default because most of the time I use it to transfer photos to my PC. Once I had it set up, it has worked flawlessly. Some tips to make things easy in internet mode on the PC...1) On your router, assign a static IP address to the Transcend card. This way you will always know what the IP address is.2) I downloaded Chrome specifically to use with the card on the PC because Transcend has an extension that allows you to select what you want to download and it will download them all at once.3) I set the homepage in Chrome to be the IP of the Transcend card(I only use Chrome for this purpose) so it starts right up(it will prompt you for the login info but you can save that in Chrome)4) Now this is where the improvements can be made. On the cards homepage, there is a button for "Photos" clicking that does NOT bring me directly to the photos on the HX300. I must still drill down another level to see the pictures. It would be nice if it dropped me in the actual pictures directory directly.5) After opening the pictures directory, I can then goto the Transcend Chrome extension and see all the photos, select them and download them. The shortcoming is you won't see anything in the Transcend extension unless you goto the picture directory in the regular interface first.I'd LOVE to see an actual PC program to do the downloading(something like the camera companies have when you connect the camera to the PC) instead of having to use a web interface.The phone app isn't bad, as it has a little more refinement than the webpage. The only issue I have had is when trying to upload a photo to Twitter on the android phone app(Samsung Note 2 Android 4.3). When I select it, it gives me a spinning wheel for a second then says upload cancelled. It never gives me the chance to initially authenticate with Twitter and authorize the card, like when initially uploading to Facebook did.I've also noticed another bug, when I browse the photos on the camera, it sometimes will not create a thumbnail and I'm left with a generic icon and no way to know what the picture is, unless I open(and wait for it to download) the picture. Frustrating.Otherwise, the download speeds are OK, nothing to write home about, but then again, the pics on my camera are 20.4 mega pixels so that's a lot of size to download.Overall, this works well, but could use some serious user interface improvements to make it a better experience..**EDIT 3/8/2014**I've lowered my score to 1 star. I switched from a Sony HX300 to a Canon SL1 and it's been a nightmare. The SL1 is supposed to be supported but it had serious problems.I used the same method of using the card as I did with the HX300, having it auto connect to my network. I open Chrome, it sees the card, I see the thumbnails of the photos fine but when I try to download one, it starts then stops about half way thru and never goes any further. I have to close Chrome and start again. I tried Firefox and managed to get the photos to download individually but could not get a 1 minute movie to download. It would start and about about 10 seconds into the download would die and stop.Not sure why it worked with the HX300 but is having so much trouble with the SL1 but since I'm keeping the SL1, this has to go back.**EDIT 3/10/2014**So the issue is wifi RANGE. When the thing was in the Sony HX300, I could connect ok, from various points in my house. HOWEVER, when this thing is in my Canon SL1, the range is about FIVE(5) FEET and that is it. If I don't stand within about 5 feet with a CLEAR LINE OF SIGHT to my router, the thing won't transfer. I was only about 4 feet from my router but didn't have clear line of sight and it STILL didn't work. There is something about the Canon SL1(I see some other with Canon cameras with the same issue) that seems to REALLY reduce the signal coming from this card. I am not sure why it is, it is, so this is going back.
$SUMMARY.: Works well in Sony HX300, but is terrible with the Canon SL1

$review_text.: (update below)I moved from a high-end Android phone to this one. I was eager to move away from very expensive phones and was curious about Windows on the phone. It's very, very different than an Android phone and my initial reaction was negative. Android is a simpler OS (from a UI perspective).Two days into it, I'm liking this phone a lot. Getting used to Windows, and appreciate what it does. At first I was concerned about missing my apps. I got those replaced with Windows apps. I can't get the same apps and don't have the same number of choices, but they work just fine.I was also dismayed that this phone doesn't do USB tethering. What?!?!?! No tethering? How am I going to get a network connection from my phone. It has this "internet sharing" thing, which I begrudgingly tried. This feature is great! Much nicer than having to use a 3rd party app and a USB cable and fighting problems with those. It's things like this are making this phone attractive to me.So far this seems to be a great smartphone and I'm expecting to like it more than my Android phone - will give an update in a couple of weeks. For the price this seems like a great value.---------------------Couple of weeks later and I am really liking this phone. One caveat: it does not have the same number of apps. I'm missing one or two that were convenient to have. For me the number is that small. Otherwise, it's been great. The features are good - better than on my Android phone. The UI is different. Not better or worse than Android. This phone is a fantastic value.

$REVIEW.: From the looks and feel of this product, I had high expectations for these speakers even though they were about $25.00. Granted I wasn't expecting Bose quality but still I had hope these had good decent sound and volume. Unfortunately I was disappointed.  Although there is some adjustment it doesn't help the sound quality much. It's pretty flat. Vocals sound awful. With the volume, even at it's loudest, it's not very loud. You would expect speakers of this sound to have some punch, or make some noise, but falls short in both areas. I had a pair of $15.00 no name brand speaker, and the sound quality of that set and the volume was much better than this set...

$REVIEW.: I got these as a replacement for an old set of Sony MDR-V150 headphones and they work just great

I found them to have a crisper sound, particularly in the mid tones, so I adjusted my equipment to reflect that, since the old Sony headphones had a more blended sound
I find that individual instruments and vocals are more distinct with these headphone
This model seems well constructed; however, the headband is a little stiffer and the ear pads are a little smaller than I would like (not as noise-cancelling)
For that, I took away one star; but, in general, I find them to be a worthy replacement for my old headphones
I also like the red mark and the tactile dot on the ear pieces to make it easier to figure out what goes where, so, if I could, I'd add back a half a star

I thought I wouldn't like having a shorter cable, but since I'm doing more listening with small music players, it's actually better to have it shorter


I've never been disappointed with Sony products, and this is no exception here


For a good-sounding, well-made product, you can't beat the price.

$REVIEW.: When I first received the tablet I was full of joy and excitement. The thought of a windows tablet was exciting, especially one that is in essence, a 32 bit PC!First off the unit was extremely sluggish and slow at responding. Doing a complete restart (turning it back into factory defaults) fixed that issue a bit and the response to my touch improved, as well as loading webpages. After further playing around I had issues downloading windows updates. The unit would show having full signal, can load webpages, but when it came to updates and downloading apps nothing would budge.So I'm both pissed and wondering what is the issue here, I researched WiFi issues with this tablet and a few months ago there were reports of issues with the WiFi card. This was pre-April I believe, but I still felt something was off.Called Lenovo support and they immediately had me download certain updates that could fix the issues. It didn't help, but the folks at Lenovo did something that was surprising to me. They sent me a repair box the next day by UPS one day air. I'm not kidding, called them at 3pm and before 10am the next day I had a box on my doorstep to ship the tablet to them.Due to the Labor day weekend there was a slight delay in it returning to me, but that has nothing to do with Lenovo. The tablet arrived back yesterday September 4th, via overnight UPS shipping and guess what, tablet works beautifully! This doesn't even feel like the same tablet I sent in, amazing! All of this from IMB\Lenovo support without paying a dime, just an hour on the phone with them. The repair form from Lenovo repair shows issues with the mainboard and WiFi card, I'm glad I sent it in. You are certainly buying more then just an amazing tablet here, you're getting Lenovo support. I also purchased 3 year square trade on it, but the standard warranty from Lenovo is surprisingly well, I'm not used to overnight shipping from any company unless I've had multiple issues with the same product over a short time, but first time excellent service like this is nice.Only complaint I may have is I bought this before the new CPUs from Intel arrive, other then that I've already replaced my laptop with this.Excellent support from Lenovo, and a very nice 32 bit windows tablet. I'm very happy I went with Lenovo over other brands.

When searching for a good cover, I came across this item - the combination of leather cover and Bluetooth keypad made this item very attractive. I was still skeptical of the ability of the functions to work well.  The item arrived in 2 days thanks to Amazon Prime. I charged it for 4 hrs as instructed and followed the instructions (a bit dated for my iPad mini because the Bluetooth setting is a bit diff then the instructions) - it worked perfectly!  Very cool to type - needs some getting used to a cramped keyboard but way cool! Nice leather (faux?) case. So far so good and I'm very happy after the bad experience with the previous cover from another seller. Two thumbs up!

$REVIEW.: Simply put, this lens is amazing, but is for wide-angle fanatics only!If you're just looking for a normal wide-angle lens you're probably better off with something like theNikon 16-35mm f/4G ED VR II AF-S IF SWM Wide Angle Zoom Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras, as it will cover most of the same focal range as this lens, includes VRII, and will save you about $800.But if you crave that extra 2mm, you absolutely will not be sorry for purchasing this lens.Of course there's a slight amount of bowing, but I haven't seen a 14mm lens that keeps straight lines as straight as this one does, and the images are exceptionally sharp and clear.The biggest drawback of this lens other than its price and weight is the fact that the shape of the front lens elements precludes the use of any sort of protective filter, so if you're not careful you WILL smack your lens on something, and you've just created a $1800 paperweight


:-(Also given the front lens surface it's guaranteed to get dirty/wet in anything but the cleanest environments, so carry some type of lens cleaning kit with you whenever shooting with this lens.Note also the lens cap is a unique design that does not snap on, so be careful or you'll be spending $10 or so for a replacement, as there's simply no other way to cap the front of this lens.In short, if you need it or just want it for its capabilities, you won't be sorry you made an investment in this lens, one I can guarantee you'll be using on your next several full format bodies or 35mm film cameras
 (If you've a DX-format Nikon, look elsewhere as there's no need to purchase this lens.)Note that NASA apparently agreed, as just last December they purchased 11 D3S cameras and seven copies of this lens to document the construction of the International Space Station from the Space Shuttle:

$review_text.: I purchased my Onkyo TX-SR805 mainly for the number of HDMI inputs.  I am very happy with it so far.Pros: 1) very clear sound output 2) functions and options galore, including 3 working assignable hdmi inputs, a number of digital and optical sound inputs, 7.1 surround sound, etc.Cons: 1) runs really hot 2) the size can be good and bad, but make sure you measure your tv stand/table before you buy.All in the pros far outweigh the cons, and I would purchase this again, especially for around $650.

$review_text.: I like this TV, but the problem is when I wanted to see my local digital TV station on channel 13 it would not pick up in my first floor apartment

 I will have to take it outside and see if it can receive stations outside
 Still right now it's great for watching cable television or satellite TV channels like Free to Air broadcasts while being outside since it has a excellent connection to cable television

 I would recommend this LCD TV for connecting your camera, satellite receiver, or your video game system since it has a input for audio video signals, you can even connect one of those cheap DVD players to it and watch a movie.The digital reception needs a lot of work such as having a tuned amplified VHF/UHF antenna and if you are still unlucky you need to put the antenna outside on top of the rain gutter or outdoor installation
 Cause of the F Jack you could use it to connect a microwave down converter to see wireless cable stations or TVRO
 I recommend this LCD TV for RF engineers who are still using a black and white set, still the blue screen could be annoying, but all new TV's have that anyways so get used to it.I am glad I bought this television and soon I am going to get a second one so my girlfriend can watch her favorite show and I can watch mine

 I am going to to use the cable line to get expanded basic cable and use the converter box, and antenna signal with A B C switch, but first I have to get the second set to complete the project.UPDATE:  I have some great news,  the TV works better outside receiving local and semi localstations
 During the test,  I took the TV to another location to see if I can get more stations, the good news I received the most DTV and analog signals in the Virginia Beach, Virginia 23464 area up to 21 stations

 While I put the magnet mount telescoping rod antennaon top of the SUV, the scan came up to 19 stations plus the rare signal of WSKY-DT channel 4came in, which was rare

 This LCD TV is great for trips, but the signals were not strongenough to stay put, but there is another approach I may consider for this TV with the rodantenna or any other antenna is the active antenna kit that you build with a soldering iron.This TV is great for portable use according to my outing tests, but a RF pre-amplifier is recommended for indoor use and outdoor use for HDTV signals.Coming up next: The test for the road trip to Augusta, GA

$review_text.: I bought the Metz 48 flash along with the Lumiquest Pro bounce system to use with my Pentax K20d


I have loved the results of the camera in general, but the Metz in combination with the Lumiquest  opens up a whole new world of possibilities and great photography.Using the Metz alone immediately paid dividends with broader, softer lighting and with the ability to swivel and bounce the flash the potential, in my opinion, is better than that of using the Pentax 360
 The build quality is good - at least as good as the Pentax flash - but the menus are a bit arcane and take a bit to master
 Most of the time the flash starts in an appropriate setting but it is worth a quick look to verify that it has not shifted into another setting, something that happened to me once

 But the immediate benefits with both indoor and fill shots was amazing


 Adding the Lumiquest system simply adds flexibility and softens the light even more, but it also means more to learn how to get the most out of


 Starting with the Metz is highly recommended!  Master that first and then add the additional benefits and flexibility of the bounce.Overall, the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is the menu system


 But the flash build and light quality are certainly worth the price and far, far exceed using the built-in flash for all but emergencies.

The aluminum and plastic are thick and heavy giving the hub a high quality feel and look.I've tested this with multiple usb 3.0 and 2.0 products like usb sound card, 128,64,32gb usb 3.0 drives and a usb 3.0 1 tb external all without any performance lag.so my pros are-Great feel and looks very premium.-Reliable connection ports.-5gbps allows use of all 7 ports with no lag.-Charges multiple devices at fast pace.-Power button works as a quick eject for all device.-Easy to set up plug and play.-Tapered design allows hub to look great under monitor.-Can't really find a negative on this device best hub on the market.

$REVIEW.: I'll keep this relatively short. Everything that's been said is correct. This system sounds amazing for the price. Check that...it sounds amazing, period. Typically, the speakers in HTiB systems are a bit tinny and cheap. Not this one. The Boston Acoustic speakers packaged with this unit sound as good as any speakers I've ever heard for their small size.The receiver itself is what you'd expect from Denon: lots of features, solid build, and that general aura of quality. It's not flashy to look at, but it doesn't set out to be. The fact that it includes Denon's Audyssey calibration system, which uses a mic to auto-calibrate the speakers, is insane, given that traditionally this has been a feature restricted to their much more expensive receivers.My ONLY knock against this HTiB package is the instructions. You get two sets: a brief one for the BA speakers, and a big one for the AVR-591 receiver. This complicates things because neither was written with any explicit knowledge of the other product in the package. My recommendation: once everything is plugged in, throw the speaker instructions back in the box. Also, the receiver instructions are a bit wonky at first glance. A quick reference/quick setup card specifically for this package would have been nice.It's all worth it, though. I've watched Blu-Rays, DVDs, and played PS3 games through this sucker so far, and it's simply top notch.

$REVIEW.: Update April 30, 2007.  I have spoken with a number of people about how to fix this problem, which I've been told is called "stiction."  None of the adjustments on the head fix it, nor can you fix it with lubricants.  Bottom line: I have no choice but to return it to the manufacturer.  Their service department emailed me today asking me to mail it back and noting "this ball head is not easy to repair."  So I'm not too pleased about this and would change my rating to 3 stars if that were an option on this site.I agree with the many positive remarks about the Bogen-Manfrotto 322RC2, but on my model at least, the action is very sticky: when I squeeze the grip and swivel the head, nothing happens until I increase the pressure, and then it leaps.  If I'm trying to swivel the camera upward, the result is that the camera hits me in the eye.  Adjustments of the rotating knob don't seem to help at all.  If anyone has a fix, I'd be grateful and would change my rating to a full five stars.

I would have given them 5 stars, but the headband does not adjust quite small enough, if you are of small stature.  The ear pieces go down a bit low, on my head, even when I have the headband at the smallest setting.  The headphones are light & comfortable, but a bit loose on my head.  If you are a smallish person, alike myself, these headphones may slip around on your head, if you are moving around quickly in them.

 These discs have the most space to write on, and have the best face for writing on then any I've used or seen

 I don't like making labels for discs, and the Sharpie is the quickest and best way to annotate discs, as far as I'm concerned
The printing on these discs does not get in the way of me writing on them.Some of the name brand discs have a high failure rate

 One name brand starting with an "S" is the worst, and on one occasion about 10 out of a 100 were bad

 These Amazon disks have all been good so far with no failures, but that's only with the first 10 that I've used so far

$REVIEW.: The product worked, but is very flimsy. There is a plastic screw that keeps the tension on the iPod Holder, and everytime you remove and replace the charger you put more and more pressure on the cheap plastic stock.. So it broke within a month of my very careful useage. To stream the music through your car radio, you have to find a fm frequency that is not in use on your car radio, and then sync that with the same frequency on the charger,& they recommend that you find an fm frequency with unused bandwidth either side of it, to avoid high pitched interference.. I found it almost impossible to find an unused frequency (and I live in rural Massachusetts..) so if I were you, I would spend 5 or 10 minutes carefully searching the FM frequencies on the car radio & make sure that you find one that isn't taken before you order this.. -Even though I couldn't find one with empty bandwidth either side, the slim gap was enough. I can listen to the iPod through my car radio with just a little bit of interference here and there, and it charges my ipod touch 2g, which makes it worth keeping, returns are so time consuming and such a pain. However, I will buy some black duck tape to hold the thing together. I really don't think it's worth the $40 that I paid for it, but I couldn't see anything for less money that did the job.. if you see something for less money, try it, because the quality that comes with this product isn't going to be any better than a cheaper alternative. If you can't find anything less expensive, and it's not worth your time to keep searching, order this, but also get the black duck tape. And tape up the stock before it breaks, that might make it last longer.

Memory card is also quite good, it's a 16GB Class 6 SDHC card and I got it for my new Canon Rebel XSi DSLR Camera to save the images in RAW format


RAW file size is huge, around 16MB for 1 photo

So with this card I can comfortably take 1000 pics without formatting


As it is a class 6 SDHC card, camera read/write speed is also fast


Another great stuff is the card reader


I am using MacBook Aluminum and it doesn't have in built card reader

So this external card reader is great help for me


I don't have to connect the camera with USB cable with MacBook
Just pull the SDHC card, put it in card reader and plug the card reader into the USB port of MacBook


Then iPhoto or Adobe Lightroom instantly detect the storage and transfer it fast.

And so...I called Nikon.After the rep checked for about 60 seconds or more with someone else, I get this response, confirmed in writing: "Thank you for calling Nikon today. I am sending you an email confirming that your D600 is not compatible with AI lenses. If you have anymore questions please feel free to give us a call back."THANK YOU, THANK YOU KEN ROCKWELL (A HERO, like travel advocate CHRIS ELLIOTT): "(rude word)/use the NON CPU LENS data menu and you're good to go!" And so I would be, except seconds after the Nikon ruling, I obtained a return authorization from B&W; (generous, since just past 30 days), and immediately caught the postal carrier. So out about $35 for two-way shipping on the aforementioned lens.Support Rockwell and Elliott for the betterment of humanity, or something short of that.PREVIOUS:Reconditioned D600 arrived with a mini-minor issue: the rear screen protector kept falling off. From examination, the top tab seems to have been broken.A call to Nikon Service brought a shuffle, with the first representative indicating that this might not be covered -- after two days from purchase. The next representative started grilling me on whether I knew how the screen worked, if I had broken it. To hell with Nikon. I hung up and order another from China for pennies. And for this it has totally annoyed a 48-year customer, before retirement a member of NPS (Nikon Professional Services).

$REVIEW.: As a person familiar with an older version of Photoshop and someone who has always enjoyed painting and drawing with real oils, acrylics and graphite, I was stunned at the possibilities and the intuitive ease of Corel PAINTER X3.  Although I am still learning, I cannot imagine a mode of painting and drawing or paper and canvas type that is not already a pert of this amazing software.  Whether chalk, pencil or paint, prints of final art renderings are impossible to discern from "real" world media.The range of brushes alone makes digital painting a delight whether dry brush technique (which I prefer) or working with "wet oil" or watercolor.Numerous "helps" include perspective guidelines and "jitter" that simulates random elements of muscle movement but can also be further enhanced by Opacity, Grain, Size, Feature, Angle and other adjustments.I am learning how to use custom palettes and brushes and save them for individual works-in-progress.The product description does not do this superb creative software justice. If you are an artist or just enjoy dabbling on the weekends, but have never tried digital art, you are in for a huge surprise.  The best thing is that my work space remains clean and my paints and brushes don't dry out.Corel Painter X3 is of course compatible with Photoshop.  Tutorials are clear and easy to follow.  Many more tutorials exist on line.The creative possibilities are seemingly endless and totally up to you.I use an older Wacom tablet and am very happy with the results.Highest recommendation.

$review_text.: Works as expected

Somewhat lighter than the OEM adapter, which is great

The cord from the computer to the adapter is relatively short so you cannot put the adapter on the floor easily and reach the computer


The other end from the adapter to the wall is also shorter than what comes with the OEM adapter

So I switched them  because I use the OEM at home (heavier) and travel with the lighter one
If cords were longer on this, I would give it a 5 star rating.

$REVIEW.: After having some experience with someone else's LX-3 I decided a Lumix would be my next point and shoot purchase.The numerous external controls keep you from having to menu dive during shoots, while having enough presets to allow one to just power up and take pictures. Image quality was rather fine after a firmware update as others have mentioned. Overall I have been very pleased with this camera and would totally consider another Lumix in the future.

$review_text.: These batteries are similar in size and offer similar performance to the OEM batteries.  They don't generate any nag messages or errors in the camera, nor do they get oddly hot or otherwise seem less than the OEM batteries.  The price is a great savings, and having a spare (or two) is a huge plus when shooting with a proprietary battery.  These days SD card storage is so cheap and so big that you really never run out of space in the field, but batteries are the new limiting factor (ala film), so grabbing a spare battery is a great idea.  I don't hesitate to use these in myPanasonic DMC-FZ150K 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom (Black), but I still tend to use the OEM as my primary and these as backups.  I didn't bother with screen protectors, so I cannot comment at all about them.  The microfiber seems nice enough, but I haven't used it yet.

$review_text.: I find these to sound extremely neutral and a little boring to listen to without an EQ and headphone amp.  They have a true monitor sound.  I prefer to listen to them with my headphone amp - this is where they really shine.  When amplified these little guys can put out some impactful sub-bass down to 35htz while keeping the balance of your music in check.  Meaning, the mids and high's are not distorted.  I will say the 4k area of these IEM's can be a bit harsh sounding, but a simple adjustment to the EQ can correct that.I have around 80 hours on them currently.  I do not know if they need a burn in, but I did the usual day of alternating pink-white sound, then the rest of the time with a variety a music ranging from rock, metal, electronic and dub.  I wish i could say the sound changed, but I don't think it did.  Unlike some headphones that really re-shape themselves after a burn in, these just seem to remain consistent, clear and fun to listen to.If you are going to listen to them on your phone or tablet, you might not be too excited about them, but with a good amp and equalizer, i find these to be a very warm, full sounded IEM, and would purchase them again should I lose or break mine.

$REVIEW.: I am using this in a WHS 2011 Installation with an HP Proliant N40L. I had no issues at all getting it up and running with the most recent drivers from StarTech's website. My main reason for using this controller was for the port multiplier support. Currently I am using only one port on the controller with a 4-bay external enclosure. You could use two 5-bay enclosures for a total of 10 drives, which means that you could have (10) 4TB drives for a grand total of 40TB on this single card.  I've experience no issues with drives mounting within the OS. The drives stay online and overall performance is phenomenal for this price-point. I think that for a home users or enthusiast this is the best value on the market currently.Pros: For me the biggest pros are that it supports hot swap via esata and it has LED headers for HDD activity LED indicators.Cons: I have encountered none thus far, but it looks like others have verified that it doesn't work on within Mac OS X.
$SUMMARY.: Great performance and overall value.

$REVIEW.: This camera sells for less than the cost of a good lens so when you are reviewing it try to keep that in mind. I find all of these point and shoots excel in bright sunlight (don't all cameras). While you can get a decent picture indoors, you should set your expectations as moderate in that endeavor. Indoor lighting is more than opening a blind on one side, turning on the dining room chandelier (because it is annoyingly bright) and turning on an incandescent or cfl bulbed lamp in the corner and thinking you have achieved some proper lighting scenario. Lighting is complex at best and most indoor lighting sux for photography, plus you are using a stock lens. I mean do you really think at this price point all your pics are gonna look great? Well only in direct sunlight maybe.The video is touted as 720p and while I don't know about that, I will say that I am very impressed with the detail and clarity achieved in outdoor shoots. I stuck a class 6 card in there as suggested in the owners manual (even though a regular SD card seemed to work) and it is very smooth. I can rapid fire still shots as the data writes very quickly to the card. The feature set is rich and the menu friendly and intuitive. Overall, a great little performer AND I got it for a buck and a half through my employee discount. Oh, and great battery life as well!!!

$REVIEW.: While on a recent wildlife cruise in Valdez, Alaska, it was great having this battery as a fully-charged and ready to go replacement for the battery that went dead in my camera (I had used that battery for high quality scenery and family pictures long before going on the cruise).  Between the two batteries, I was not only able to take all the pictures I wanted on the cruise, but I also had plenty of juice to take lots of pictures in Denali Park, and still have enough power to take many more pictures.  With these two batteries, I will never need to worry about a lack of battery power to take as many pictures as I want on trips or at family gatherings.

$REVIEW.: I don't want something that pretends to be a toaster a bumper jack a telephone and a shiatsu massager all in on.  I want something that does a few things well.  I want my address book, and a calendar and a handy calculator to be easily accessible.  A priortizable to-do list as well.  The Z-22 has exactly that.  I bought a sudoku add-on for when I'm stuck in waiting rooms or wherever.  It's light --- hardly even know it's in my shirt pocket.  It's got all the convenience I want.  I'm very skeptical about those "Ron Popiel" type devices that do everything but take a shower for you.  SThe calendar view even integrates your actual calendar, your to-do list, AND birth dates from your contacts list.  It's hard to beat for the price --- and does EVERYTHING it says it does with no further strings attached.  Very easy to sync, too.  Mac users be warned, however.  Its software is compatible with OS 9.xx and not beyond.

$REVIEW.: There is plenty of technical information that you can spend hours and hours looking at. As a consumer of electronics, myself, I enjoy hearing the "nuts and bolts" reviews from honest consumers who want to make sure they are making a sound purchase.If I could stand on my computer chair and scream, "You'll LOVE this Kodak Easyshare P850", I would do it for you. I have had digital cameras since the very beginning, even long before people could even entertain the idea of a 1 Megapixel Digital Camera. Kodak has come through, once again, with another EASYSHARE Camera with 5 Megapixels and a 12x Stabilized Zoom.I have a friend who likes to tell me that I paid too much for this camera. He likes to remind me that he can find a 5MP Digital Camera on a popular auction site and the cost is less than half of the well-priced Kodak Easyshare P850. What I have to tell him is that "You Get What You Pay For" when you purchase a higher-end digital camera. He doesn't realize, until I spend time explaining this to him, that the cameras he has shown me might advertise that they have 5 Megapixels but that is ONLY when the enclosed software interpolates the digital information. With the Kodak Digital Camera you are getting every bit of what you have paid for and every megapixel that is offered in this fine and intelligent camera.You will find the camera to be a friendly one, many of the menus are so easy to navigate through-you'll feel like an engineer as you manipulate the many features with total ease. I've literally owned more than 10 digital cameras and as a film photographer I have spent the past few years comparing the quality of the digital cameras I had. The software, even ALONE, is worth as much as the amount you'll pay for this great camera. Taking photographs is simple, transferring them to your computer is done with absolute ease, and making changes (reducing red-eye, adding more brightness, etc) on your computer is easier than I have ever experienced.I hope this review has been somewhat helpful to you. Please spend time in reviewing the many, many features that I have not touched on. There are sites, [...] that allow consumers to compare honest reviews (and competitive prices too) on incredible digital cameras like this one.Don't feel that if you spend the hard earned money on this camera, that technology will soon make your camera seem like a dinosaur. Technology is always changing, however the Kodak Easyshare P850 5MP Digital Camera will compete with the best of the best for many years to come. Enjoy this intelligent, durable and uncomplicated digital camera.Thanks again for taking the time to listen to my opinion on this camera. I always worry that people, like my Mom, might get suckered into buying a camera that isn't as advertised. I would not hesitate to pursuade my Mom to buy this attractive and totally functional digital camera.Sincerely,Peter CannicePhoenix, ArizonaFeel free to email me if I have left something out or if you need anything at all.

$review_text.: When the installer first showed me this unit after he put it in - I was pretty thrilled. It was my first bluetooth-through-stereo, and it worked great with my iPhone 4. Good sound quality (both ways), shows me who's calling right there on the screen; easy to make calls and answer them .But then I tried to use the everyday functions, and the whole good feeling went south. There's multiple menu clicks (requiring more than one button) for almost everything. I think there was at least 3 clicks to go from FM to AM. You kidding me? I'm driving! I can't be searching through menus to do s---t like that...Going from random play back to non-random through the Flash drive (via USB connection), something I do often, was all kind of clicks. Couldn't wait to get this thing outta my car. Switched to an Alpine CDE-123, and despite needing to get an extra unit for the Bluetooth for that particular unit (haven't done that yet), I am thrilled. Alpine's navigation is vastly superior.Sorry Kenwood - but your engineers might try actually driving around with one of these things before taking it to market...

$review_text.: I got this camera strap with my brand new DSLR


 After just an afternoon of shooting with it, the paint on my strap attachment points has been almost completely chipped away by the metal fasteners at the end of this strap!  I couldn't believe that Lowepro would make such a nice comfortable strap then put two metal rings with sharp edges as the fasteners

 Then I realized that you're supposed to take them off before you put them on the camera, although you wouldn't guess that from the product picture

 After I took the rings off and mounted the nylon loops as I think was intended, the strap doesn't jingle and rattle around and doesn't tear the paint off my camera


 The strap is a little longer than the stock strap, which makes the camera sit right over my bellybutton (I'm 5'8") if it's hanging straight off my neck

 When worn like a bandolier, it's the perfect length, can't get stolen as easily, and you can tuck the camera away when you don't want a camera bouncing off your chest and stomach as you walk around.

However, I tried the charger briefly in my car to see if it at least charged my Kindle Fire.  It did work well with my Kindle, but I was surprised at how hot it had become in the short time that I had it hooked to my Kindle.  I don't know if this is normal or if it would have continued to getter hotter with longer use.

The jacket comes with a belt clip, arm strap and of course the jacket itself. I have to agree with the reviewer that said the jacket seems too tight for the ZuneHD at first, but all the jackets I've bought have been like this at first but eventually loosen up after use. I was able to take the ZuneHD out of the jacket with no problems. I think the jacket is a good fit and I'm confident it wont fall out in case I forget to strap the bottom velcro. The last jacket I bought lasted me a few years with heavy use and I'm confident this one will last just as long with moderate use.

$REVIEW.: I just bought a 160GB iPod Classic and this dock with the idea of storing most of my CD collection in lossless format and play through my home stereo system.  I love the iPod but the dock is a joke.  Like all Apple products, it comes in fancy packaging, including a nice black box and a collection of neatly arranged dock adaptors.  That's where the fun ends.  Some issues to note:1.  No cables whatsoever come with the dock.  No 3.5mm to RCA, no 30-pin to USB, none.  So, in addition to the $49 price tag, you need to supply all your cables.2.  To add insult to injury, no AC adaptor is supplied.  Docks are meant to be plugged in, right?3.  The remote can basically control de volume and back/forward songs.  It doesn't seem to want to do anything else.4.  The audio quality from the line out is surprinsingly lousy.  I thought all line out connections were the same, but apparently not.  I did not test the video output.To test my suspicions I bought a Dynex dock to compare.  For basically the same amount of money, I also got: 1. S-Video output, 2. AC adaptor, 3. 30-pin to USB cable, and 4. 3.5 mm to RCA cable.  In terms of performance, the Dynex blew the Apple's socks off. The audio quality is noticeably better and the remote actually does what it is supposed to do.In summary:  Unless you absolutely NEED to have the Apple brand in your dock, don't bother.  This product is not worth it.  Unlike other Apple products that match design and packaging with performance, this one really does not perform.

I only watch TV in there once in a while and don't want to pay all of the monthly fees. With this cord (which is the perfect length to attach to my TV and keep the laptop within reach) I am able to hookup within a couple of minutes and stream anything on my TV that I can stream on my computer. I compared the price to similar products at Best Buy and found this to be a pretty good price. Also, if you have Prime shipping or super saver, you save money and don't have to deal with the big-box-store hassles.The quality is very good. It feels like a heavy-duty cable that won't give me any issues. The connections are quite easy and worked well with my Sony flat screen 1080 whatever. The High Def seems to be very high quality as well (that is such a man-thing) Overall, this cord does exactly what it should and I highly recommend it.

$REVIEW.: Before ETSU started using Rebel T3i's in their DIGM department to film, they used Sony FX-1 cameras that you had to download off of with Firewire. When I had bought my Dell, my Mom didn't see a point with getting that option with it, but five years later down the line, and ETSU kicking out all their old computers out the door with beastly new machines that did not have this feature, I had to search for a card that would give my Inspiron 530 that capability.This card was recommended by users on a Dell forum that would give the same performance as the original OEM part is extremely hard to find. In conjunction with the internal cord off an old machine to put the plug up front, it had the connecting pins on the card to connect that as well. When the time came to plug the camera in and download footage, it worked wonderfully. Needless to say I was able to film like I needed to.

$review_text.: I bought these a couple of months ago as a "knock around" pair of ear buds for when I didn't want to take my more expensive Shure earbuds.These are very, very comfortable and have good bass response.  In fact, these are the best earbuds I've used that were less than $30.  They don't have the bass response of my Shure's but these are also a fraction of the price.  The bass can be a little muddy from these but generally it is quite good.The build quality is very good.  The only thing I'm not crazy about is that I don't think you can buy replacement rubber caps for the buds.  They seem to be very well made, but they're only going to last a set amount of time.  I like these enough that I'd like to be able to buy additional caps instead of buying new earbuds.In conclusion, these are worth the money.  They are comfortable and have very good sound.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy them again.

$REVIEW.: Small, but not extremely small, optical mouse. It has a yo-yo mechanism that extends, holds and retract the cord. The only "problem" is that the yo-yo mechanism, tends to fail when the cord starts rotating. It's not a big problem but if you are to picky to hassle with the cord choose a wireless mouse. Can't beat the value for this mouse.

$REVIEW.: This is a simple little piece of plastic that does just what it is supposed to do. It will work with any GPS unit that uses a flash shoe mount and I recommend it for use with the Promote GPS unit. At $13.00 it is grossly over priced for what it is, but if you need it, go for it.

$REVIEW.: Good SubWoofers have gotten a lot smaller over the years and this one is a good example. It is self powered AND it recognizes that it needs to turn off or on the amplifier when needed. It has both speaker inputs and line-level inputs for  signal acquisition. It has a small footprint and has a downward firing speaker. You can adjust the bass cutoff point and what phase it occurs.

$review_text.: This remote is a nice upgrade from the 880. The button layout, the comfortable feel in your hand, and the surprisingly well executed touch screen are all very nice. As others have mentioned, this thing is beautiful but it picks up smudges and fingerprints ridiculously easily. Hopefully Logitech will address this minor annoyance, and perhaps add RF support in version 2.0.UPDATE: After using this for a month, I would never want to do without it. In terms of both function and comfort, the Harmony One is light years ahead of the 880. It would be a bargain at twice the price.

$review_text.: Considering that other similar, in every way, units go for less than $10.00, yes, this is overpriced.  But hey, people like me are willing to pay it (for now), so why not.  Good for them.Is is worth it? I think only for the peace-of-mind factor.  You spend as much as a car for a camera and lens, yes, you do want to feel it is secured by proven accessories.  Is it truly more secure? I own this one and a $10.00 equivalent, and I have had no problems with either.  Ever.  I just make sure that for both that the fastener is ALWAYS tight, and use a little common sense.As for comfort, the neck strap is a little thinner (i.e., more comfortable) with this one, but for a fat guy like me, the $10.00 one has a little longer (i.e., more comfortable) strap.Conclusion: would I buy it again? Yes,  But then again when the time comes to buy the double strap for two cameras, unless I have $5000.00-location shoots by then and both my cameras are Canon 1D's with L lenses,  I think I will go with the cheaper alternative ($130.00? Seriously?).

$review_text.: After trying several other wireless keyboard/mouse sets, I decided to spend the extra money and came back to Logitech. And it was money well spend. Total quality & functionality. Feel & ease of use are excellent. It handled the somewhat rough use of daily work and even survived a cup of coffee being spilled on it. I use this set for several hours every day and only change batteries every 6 months. The ergonomics are perfect for me.UPDATE: After several months use, I have found 1 annoying problem. Under heavy use, like typing 40 wpm or better, some of the keys have a habit of jamming. I'll go back and proofread what I've written and find missing letters. Either the key wasn't pressed hard enough or the switch underneath didn't contact. I've tried other keyboards and don't have this problem. So it has to be this keyboard. I own 2 (1 at home & 1 at work) and they both suffer from this problem. The key force is a bit heavy for my taste as well.Update #2: After 2 years of home use and a year of office use, I'm tired of this uncooperative keyboard. The keys malfunctioning has gotten worse. They fail to function randomly and they are slowing me down considerably. The letters on many of the keys are long gone. The mice still work fine, although the side switches on the older one has gotten a bit touchy. Clearly this keyboard is not designed for constant professional use. in comparison, the wired Dell supplied keyboards used by everyone else in the office are reaching their 6th year of use. Most of them hardly look used and function flawlessly. I'm looking for a new keyboard. And it won't be Logitech this time.

I downloaded an app Photopills to help calculate my needed exposure length and hyperfocal distance.Paired with my Hilti range finder (PD-4 and PD-30) to find my subject's exact distance, the app and filter enable me to take some pretty awesome images. I am still learning, but it is a lot of fun.Highly recommend this filter if you are wanting to take long exposures during the daytime or of brightly lit objects.Package came fast and as expected from amazon. Filter wasn't dirty upon arrival as with other filters I have purchased. Solidly built.Completely satisfied, thus far.  Happy shooting

$REVIEW.: My son received a used computer (PC) as a gift which had no wi-fi card. He got wi-fi by running through an older laptop (Mac) which did have wi-fi, but somewhat of a pain to always be sure the laptop was awake so he could get wi-fi.This little baby did the trick! He now has wi-fi on his new computer with no problems what-so-ever and the price was really affordable! Sure it may not have as strong a signal as a PCI wi-fi card, but it's also easy to transfer to other computers.

Plugged it in, very nice build quality and love the size.  Two folders pop up with two apps...one is called RunClubSandisk and the other RunSandiskSecure.  I can tell you right now that RunClubSandisk is just for appearances only...just like a politicians family.  In order to use your &#34;password protection&#34; you have to first run your SandiskSecureVault setup. (it crashed the first time I launched it)  Then you create your secure password and drag and drop files to what looks like a flash window.  Key point, this is pointless to me, for reasons being I use this at work.  I shouldn't have to take files out of the &#34;vault&#34; and onto my desktop every time I need to use them.  Having to take them out and put them back in is not very productive.  It's also not really private, is it, if I'm putting it on my works computer.NOWHERE DOES IT SAY IN THE MANUAL HOW TO CHANGE THE PASSWORD.It's also VERY SLOW!  When editing or deleting files from your vault.  So from a privacy stand point it's crap but it's a great design.I did like the tiny LED...that got it a two star...

$REVIEW.: Zune is Cool!  Overall I'm very happy with my purchase.The thing is exceedingly easy to use - with most electronic devices, I play with them for a while and then break out the manual and read through it.  I've had my Zune for about three months now, and I just realized the other day that I've never looked at the manual.  Took me about 5 minutes to figure the whole thing out (as opposed to the dang i-pod which is a DISASTER on the user interface).The sound quality is excellent.  Using WMA-VBR and professional headphones, I can not tell the difference between the Zune and uncompressed original source (again, beats the tinny i-pod sound with no comparison).Battery life is surprisingly good.  I'm always surprised when I need to recharge it because it runs for so long.I love the screen, the way it handles pictures and video as well as music, and the overall "feel" of the device is quite solid (although a little heavy for jogging).The only issue that I have (and the only reason I give it four stars instead of five) is that the player won't sync using the Windows Media Player - you need to use the Zune player.  I don't WANT another player on my computer!!! I don't want Real Player, I don't want Quicktime or itunes or winamp, or whatever.  I just want one player that does everything.  It's quite frustrating that after I rip a CD onto my computer using the Media Player, I need to open a different piece of software to copy the files to the Zune.  I just can't figure out why they would do that.Other than this one complaint, it's as close to a "perfect" music player as you can get.

$REVIEW.: Pros:-Ergonomic Mouse and Keyboard-Long Battery Life-Soft keys-Stylish-Programmable/Customizable KeysCons:-Connectivity Issues-Mouse takes awhile to get use to-Some keys are smaller than I liked (e.g. "Backspace", "Esc", and "Pause")Other Thoughts:I initially plugged the transmitter into the back of my computer tower.  The keyboard and mouse worked fine when I was just using them for surfing the Net or using a word processor.  However, once I loaded a game (Dawn of War: Dark Crusade), there was a very annoying delay from the mouse and keyboard.  It made the game unplayable.  I figured the transmitter was not picking the signal properly because of its location.  I thought about placing the transmitter in the front end of my tower, but it looked intrusive (hey, I'm an aesthetics type of guy). Thankfully, I had an USB extension cable.  I plugged the transmitter into that and was able to place it closer to my mouse and keyboard out of sight.  Whoa-la, connectivity issue fixed.So in summary, if you are experiencing connectivity issues, just relocate the transmitter closer to the keyboard/mouse, either by putting it in the front USB port of your computer, or use an USB extension cable.

$review_text.: My brother and I set up this up in about two hours.  Most of the time was spent finding a ladder, figuring out exactly where to put it and working out where the studs in the wall were.  You definitely will need to anchor this into solid wood or use wide mollys for straight sheetrock.  It's big, about 95 inches across and weighs about 15 - 20 pounds, so make sure to measure your room before ordering.  Installation will go much smoother and faster with a helper, but one person could do it.  As far as quality goes, the screen is fairly heavy construction and the roller mechanism seems good.  The picture looked great.  I'm sure it will last a life time with proper care.

$REVIEW.: I would highly recommend avoiding this item

 I read these reviews, and I considered myself technically savvy enough to figure out any problems I encountered with this product
 Right out of the box, half of the ports consistently didn't work

 I tried using the ones that did, and every few minutes the hub would disconnect and reconnect, causing my two external drives to reconnect as well- if I had been writing data to them, it could have been very bad..


 So I played around with safe devices for a while and didn't have any successful attempts to get the hub working.Long story short: don't be dumb like me and ignore the bad reviews- if you get stuck with a lemon, it's essentially worthless

 Unless you like returning things.(Two stars because if it had worked, the small size and amount of ports is a big plus.)

$REVIEW.: While the majority of photographers have survived using a stack of books or a table in lieu of a tripod, I admit that owning a decent tripod adds more dimension and convenience to taking photographs.  I cannot deny that the VANGUARD ALTA PRO Multi-Angle Tripod covers all the bases (and then some).  I also cannot deny the fact that this particular tripod may be overkill for the everyday "picture-taker" that wants to take the occasional portrait or nature scene.The VANGUARD ALTA PRO is a rather complex tripod that is probably best-suited for "serious" photographers that require a precision-level instrument needed to photograph at multitude of angles.  I avoid using the term "professional" solely because the VANGUARDA ALTA PRO can be used by photographers of any skill level, but the steep price associated with such a precision instrument is logically geared to those with a more serious and dedicated approach to photography (which includes amateurs).Having been quite satisfied with an old Quantaray tripod I've used for the past 20 years, using the VANGUARD was like going from Volkswagen Beetle to an Abrams tank.  The tripod is extremely rugged, and while it is made of carbon fiber, the heft was a little more than I expected.  One the positive side, the solid heft of the VANGUARD provided me with peace-of-mind in ensuring my camera was stable and secure when mounted (probably my biggest concern when using a tripod).  This stability extends to every angle to tripod offers as well ... the camera and the tripod stay firmly put. I do find the myriad of angle options to be somewhat overwhelming in that I will likely never utilize the tripod to its full capacity (think Swiss Army Knife).  With that being said, it also opens the door for additional experimentation.The only issues I really had with this tripod are minor convenience frustrations associated with the legs.  First, I found the twist locks to be aggravating and uncomfortable to adjust.  Second, I would prefer a graphic (numerical) indicator for a quick, no-nonsense adjustment alternative on the telescopic legs.I found the VANGUARD ALTA PRO to be a high-quality and multi-functional tripod that should accommodate the needs of most serious photographers.

 Since Amazon has the best customer service of any store I have ever dealt with, they let me return it and gave me a full refund

The price of this sub fluctuates between $160 - $250 DAILY! Sorry AmazonAll of that being said, this sub is extremely compact for a 12&#34; speaker
 It looks very nice for a sub too

 It hits extremely low and extremely hard
 It doen't go as low, or hit as hard or tight as a more expensive SVS sub etc, but it also costs less

 I am using it in an 11' x 16' room and I have it at 25% volume and it still rocks the room

 I have turned it up just to test it and WOW can it hit


 Everyone who has heard it has been impressed.I needed a small sub to fit under a shelf, but didn't wanta 8&#34; or 10&#34; sub that only went down to 40Hz


This fit the bill perfectly

 Again, it is very small for a 12&#34; sub.

$REVIEW.: I owned many chrome devices

 This has the best display

 Easy to set up like all chrome devices


 At first the touch pad appears to be unresponsive

 After some experimentation, the best solution is to connect it to a remote mouse


 This chromebook responds to mouse control beautifully


 I like most about this one is its robust connection to youtube


 I can play through my playlist without interruption  of connection wheras other chrome devices tend to lost connection frequently

 This one works like a charm

 I now use this exclusively to chromecast youtube program to my TV without interruption as I play through my playlist from beginning to end.10/23/2013 updateThis chromebook seems to chromecast better than other chrome devices
It works seemlessly in casting youtube, that is very important for me
I wonder if others have similar experiences.


$SUMMARY.: This chromebook has the best display.  Love its robust connection to youtube.

$REVIEW.: Bought this about a year ago, and it was quite easy to set up, and worked smoothly though a bit slowly with all the computers on the network. After a couple of months, I would have to do a hard reset of it to be able to actually access any of the data on it, and the hard drive seemed to be constantly in use, even if we weren't accessing it in any way. Eventually, after about 10 months it simply stopped booting. I'm hoping I can somehow access the files on it by putting the drive directly in my main computer, but I wouldn't recommend the product to anyone.

$REVIEW.: Love this case! My husband bought me the Kindle Fire HD for the holidays and I love it! But being the super clumsy person that I am, I knew I&#8217;d need to get a case asap.Portability - I like taking my Kindle with me sometimes and carrying it in my purse, traveling with it, etc. so I knew I wanted a case that was slim and didn&#8217;t add a lot of weight or bulk. Also, I find that the battery on the Kindle goes quicker than I&#8217;d like and I didn&#8217;t like that without the case I had to turn it off and on to preserve the life of the battery between charges. So I LOVE that this case puts the devise on automatic sleep mode when the case is closed. Then when you open the case back up&#8230; VIOLA! The devise wakes back up and you just need unlock the screen to start using it again.Function - I also like that you can charge the Kindle with the case on and closed &#8211; this is something that was important to me, as I wanted to make sure the screen was protected while I was charging on the counter. Also, I found the volume and power button on the Kindle Fire HD a little difficult to find without the case. The case actually makes it a little easier to locate and use those buttons.Fit - Another thing that was important to me was the ability to take the case off easily. I have the older (now called Paperwhite) Kindle version as well. And I have the Amazon Kindle case with the light for that one. I find it near impossible to get the case off! When I&#8217;m on vacation, I like not having the case on that one so it&#8217;s lighter (that case added a lot more bulk and weight than this case does&#8230; a definitely improvement by Amazon!). Meanwhile, this case for the Kindle Fire HD is great in that regard. It&#8217;s very easy to put the case on and off. Although I&#8217;ll be honest, I haven&#8217;t taken it off since I got the case and tested that feature out a few times. Since then, I&#8217;ve left it on indefinitely. It&#8217;s not bulky and I just haven&#8217;t had a reason to take the case off.Color - I got it in the honey color which I love! I was on the fence about it, but figured I wanted something different. I&#8217;m so glad I went with something other than black. The colored case is easy to spot in my laptop bag and/or large purse. For those considering the honey colored case, I will tell you that it&#8217;s not a bright yellow, more of a mustard yellow like other reviewers have said on here. But I like that. It seems like it won&#8217;t get dirty easily either, which was a concern I had when I picked this color. It&#8217;s something that I think will hide blemishes easy.Material - The material is soft and the pebbled leather is great because again, I think it&#8217;ll withstand a lot and not show blemishes, scratches, etc. I did A LOT of researching, reading reviews, etc. before buying this case.Value - I had a hard time dropping this much money on the case (yes, I&#8217;m frugal), but if you can swing it, I recommend you do. I just couldn&#8217;t find a case with all that I was looking for besides this one (lightweight, slim, allowed me to charge with the case on and covering the screen, not crummy material that would look like garbage after 2 months of heavy use, case easy on and off, etc.).

$REVIEW.: This softbox is great for someone like me, that is just an amateur photographer that sometimes do some pro work. I had bought one of these softboxes and also a Rogue Flashbender for some pro indoor work I would do for a friend. This softbox is compact (just like a letter envelope), easy to install, high quality and produce great results, much better light than the Rogue flashbender. Since I would have to make a second photo session for my friend, I decided to buy another Fotodiox softbox just like the first one to use instead of the Rogue Reflector.My only comment is that, if your speedlite flash has a difuser, use it inside the softbox to produce better yet results, or you can also use one of those white plastic difusers too.Recommended!

$review_text.: This webcam is supposed to be top of the line from HP. However, in my trials it does not compete with the flagship offerings from other makes, such as market leader Logitech C910 or Microsoft Lifecam Studio, which I also own. In fact I think it barely compares with a 2nd tier products like the Logitech Pro9000. Let me try to break it down:Likes:-It is smaller than it looks in the picture and fairly slim and light.-The microphone seems to pick up mid-ranges pretty well, or the voice spectrum. It works well for video conferencing.- Skype certified onboard compression yields better video (at 720p) for conferencing.- Seems to be able to generate a saturated and bright image in low light conditions (though not sharp. See Cons.)-Plug-and-play support in Windows 7 with drivers automatically installed.Don't like so much:-While the pixel count is there, the resolving power isn't. The details are sorely missing for a high end webcam. In fact a 2nd tier Logitech Pro9000 is obviously better in a side-by-side comparison.- The viewing angle isn't quite as wide as most other top tier cameras are able to offer. While it claims to have 73 degrees angle of view, or around 24mm equivalent, it has a fairly average field of view, and obviously narrower than Logitech Pro 9000's.- The microphone's sound, while okay for voice conference, is not exactly full spectrum. There is a general lack of quality of the sound pick-up, without bass and highs in the resultant sound clip. Again it falls short of a 2nd tier Logitech Pro9000 which I pitted it against, nevermind the higher end C910 and MS Studio which this is supposed to compete with.- While subjective, I am not sure if I like the styling which has a hint of 80's design to it. The construction quality also doesn't become that of a high end webcam, with mostly plastic and a pressed sheet-metal front that has some rough edges, and exudes a bit of pretentious cheapness.Other Notes:-The physical buttons aren't terribly useful for me, and it requires HP's driver software to run in the background.- 1080p recording isn't possible without some updated/highend/expensive hardware.- Draws more power than other webcams mentioned here (logitech c910/pro9000 and MS Studio). It will not run from an unpowered USB hub, while others mentioned here could.- The much maligned clamp is almost identical to the one found on the Microsoft Webcams. The only difference is that the cam body on the HP is lighter, and the cable thicker. That may contribute to an easy pull of the cable to topple the cam from its mount. As I lodge it on top of a desktop monitor, so far there hasn't been much problems for me. However, the lightness and relative instability makes pressing those stiff physical buttons on the camera a bit tricky.Final Thoughts:This camera yields subpar results for a top-tier webcam. While on camera compression is a plus, but if you are looking for absolute image quality, the "glass lens" and auto focus doesn't contribute much to sharpen the prevalent softness. The color is saturated and it can look fairly bright, but for a premium webcam (and priced as such), it needs a bit more. The field of view is also decidedly narrower than claimed, and with somewhat unsatisfying build quality. Add a tinny microphone characteristic, the price is just unjustified. For the money, you are probably better off with the competition, notably the leading makes like Logitech and Microsoft. For other than onboard compression and Skype certification, even a relatively dated mid-tier Logitech Pro9000 performed better in many of the side-by-side comparison tests, in sound and image quality.

$REVIEW.: Having come from a Nostromo N52 I had high hopes for the Logitech G13. I am a fairly avid gamer, playing Wow several times a week. I was really looking forward to the added functionality of having the extra buttons on the G13. Unfortunately, after using the unit for just a few days, I ended up sending it back.Here's why:1) Poor Ergonomics. The joystick can not be used the same as the thumbpad on the N52. It is set too far back to be used comfortably all of the time. Also, the Joystick is too sensitive. Sometimes when I move the bar up, it would trigger as if I pushed it to the side and vice versa. My real issue though is that the unit just isn't as comfortable as the N52. Not even close. 45 minutes of gaming, and my hand was cramping.2) More buttons did not equal, well....more abilities. The extra buttons are not easily reachable....at all. Honestly, I found all but two of them unusable because I could not reach them easily. I shouldn't have to be a contortionist to use all of the buttons on a game controller. Add the fact that it is missing the scroll wheel from the N52, and I found that I really didn't have any more buttons.Build quality is stellar. It really is built FAR nicer than any game controller from Belkin. Nice and heavy, good tactile feel on keys and buttons. Backlit keys change color based on shift state. The software that comes with this is incredible, giving you the option of what you want to view on your game controller display including Battleground Stats (Wow), CPU stats, Date & Time, etc. The software for the Mac side worked great as well, and lost no functionality compared to the Windows software.I really wanted to like this product. I got sick of Belkin's non-existent Mac support for the N52, and thought this was the answer. Sadly, due to it's poor ergonomic design, it wasn't.I guess I'm now looking at an upgrade to the N52-TE.

As other reviews have stated, the headphone jack has to be pulled out slightly to connect properly to this device. The red LED light bleeds over the entire device, making it much brighter than it's supposed to be. The deal breaker for me, however, is that the output is mono. I checked this on a computer with a working sound system and and confirmed that the mono output was due to the USB sound card. If you're replacing a faulty sound system, I'd swing for a slightly more expensive stereo device.

I have to remember to transfer my data before I go to bed each night or the data is lost.

I doubt though, that there is anything else brighter out on the market today due to technology limits. One thing to get used to (for me, at least) is how to use the thing, as this is my first handheld unit. It's not very intuitive at first until you get that "A-ha!" moment. It would be nice if the user manual was actually useful. What would be a great touch for Garmin support is if they posted written and video tutorials on how to familiarize oneself with at least the basic functions of their various devices. Four stars for lack of decent user manual and tutorials.

With the garage door open it gets amphitheater type sound that the neighbors can clearly hear, but the base really pals in comparison with my Logitech 2300 that I use in the house, but the cyber acoustics satellite speakers sound better than the Logitech's


If your goal is to pound some old school hip hop from the subwoofer, you may want to spend a few more bucks, maybe something north of a hundred

$REVIEW.: This is not a glam product

It simply does what it is supposed to do and does it very well
One can set it up in two ways; either as a base for remote speakers or as a portal for wireless surround sound


Either way it works well
Signal is superb with no interference

I set the Xmod up for remote speakers and plugged it right into my audio card


I then attached the front right and left jack into the base unit to recover my computer front speakers and another set of speakers (actually two pair of L&R;) attached to the remote unit for the bedroom
So now whatever is playing on the computer in stereo (Media Player, Rhapsody, etc.) plays in the bedroom too.The Xmod could be set up for surround sound by plugging into a computer USB port


It self configures
I tried it and it worked fine.

$review_text.: I love these headphones!  The fact they are compact was good enough for me - I could always use a good pair of compact headphones since I travel so much.  Usually I break my headphones on the first trip, which is why I typically get cheap $20 products.  These fold up very nicely and come with their own handy pouch.  They  must have had air travelers in mind when making these because they also come with an audio-in jack and auxiliary cable so that you can turn the bluetooth function off and use these as traditional headphones.  They have an internal rechargeable battery which I have yet to charge after 3 trips!  My only negative really isn't a negative at all: I don't think the noise cancellation works extremely well, but - reflecting back on all the noise cancelling headphones I've ever owned - they work on par with all the rest (but these are the most expensive pair I've ever owned.  Perhaps if I go all out and spend $300 for a set of headphones then the noise cancellation will actually cancel all ambient noise).  I don't know if it's the technology that just doesn't seem to work very well or if it's the quality of headphones that I usually purchase.

$REVIEW.: 12/01/12 update - I've reverted to using my prior USB Microsoft mouseMicrosoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 - Black

 This Bluetooth sculpt mouse just disconnects too many times for my liking

 At first, it only did it once a day at most

 It now disconnects pretty much every 20 minutes or so

 I've tried troubleshooting and it's easy enough to reconnect by powering the mouse off and on but it appears to be dropping the signal for some reason

 I've confirmed it's not the computer or software


I've tried everything from replacing with fresh batteries to using a different computer

The best solution: going back to my old mouse


 Besides, that vibrating trackpad idea never really grew on me either


It's an unnecessary gimmick and another misstep for Microsoft

If people want the feel and response of a track-wheel, they'll buy a mouse with, well, a track-wheel...Out of the box, the Bluetooth connects really effortlessly
 Pairing mode automatically activates the minute you insert batteries for the first time

 You then have six minutes to pair it with your device

 It paired effortlessly with my Win 7 notebook

 I was already using a Microsoft Mobile Mouse 3500 which is slightly larger (mostly in height) and also has BlueTrack technology


 In comparison, the Sculpt Touch is flatter and more aerodynamic

 I prefer the feel of the 3500 which fits the grip of my hand nicely

 The Sculpt feels a little (not much, just a little) more awkward because I can't quite grip it the same way as a traditional mouse, but that may end up being a better healthier benefit
 More on that later

The big selling point is the touch-sensitive multi-directional scrolling bar, a horizontal silver strip down the top middle portion of the mouse instead of a track-wheel like the 3500


 If you want full body touch surface, like Apple's Magic Mouse, Microsoft also offers theMicrosoft Touch Mouse, which has full body touch surface like the Magic Mouse
 This mouse actually works pretty good
 The BlueTrack is and always has been very accurate and reliable for my needs
 I already had BlueTrack in the prior mouse and it truly is remarkable

 They aren't kidding when they say you can use it on just about any surface but some of those reports are a wee bit exaggerated

 See, having the capability to simply do something doesn't mean it can be done well

 Sure, you can use this mouse on carpet and it will work
 Just don't expect the same accuracy as a flat solid surface

 I tested it on medium thickness carpet and my cursor jumped around like MC Hammer at times

 Microsoft coyly says "airport carpet" in their BlueTrack technology page, hinting that maybe you should only use this on flat industrial carpet

 That makes sense
 Flat commercial carpet works much better than the typical thick home carpet


 I tried it on a flat runner and had much better results than on standard carpet


 This is a three button mouse
 In addition to gestures, the middle strip can be used as the left-click button as well
 It also has dedicated left and right click buttons that blend flawlessly into the body
 It's pretty attractive

 The biggest problem I have with this mouse ironically is the gesture strip

 It has tactile feedback that borders on annoying
 I have absolutely no idea why Microsoft thought this was necessary
 And it feels terrible

 Instead of nice reassuring gentle feedback like haptic devices, this vibrates (harshly at times), feels clunky, and makes rattling noises like it's about to fall apart when moderately swiped

 It feels particularly bad when scrolling through long documents or pages
 The actual scrolling motion works well both vertically and horizontally


 I'd love to tell you if the batteries last nine months as claimed, but I will update after waiting nine months, or whenever they do finally deplete, to inform how long they lasted
 It's a nice mouse and I actually think the sleeker design may end up growing on me to the point where I like and prefer it over the bulkier 3500
 When my hand gets tired during long sessions, sometimes I tend to accidentally click buttons


 This mouse causes the bulk of the weight of your hand to rest on the palm instead of evenly distributed along the mouse like the 3500
 It means less fatigue and less bending of the joints as the hand lays flatter.

$review_text.: This was my 4th L lens and my 2nd L Prime (35L is my other.)  Initially I was a little frustrated by the lens and kind of had to get used to it.  After doing some trial and error and applying a +6 micro focus adjustment, this thing is crazy sharp.  Even wide open, the sharpness is just unreal.  I can see peach fuzz on my 2 year olds face in pictures!  This has quickly become my favorite lens, particularly on my 5D2.  Focus speed is very good, color is great.  I think it has the least CA of any lens I own.  I can't recommend this lens highly enough.  For the price, it's the sharpest thing going.

$review_text.: I purchased this blu-ray player on impulse about a year and a half ago. I wanted a nice blu-ray player with 3d capabilities. It had all the features i wanted like some Sony made apps, wireless internet and could be controlled by my smartphone. The body of the player is nice, though i feel it is a bit on the large side and takes up a bit too much space on the stand. If you don't use the remote as much, the glossy front gets smudges easily and they aren't that easy to wipe off without making it worse. The interface is very good, and Sony had won awards for it as they are well deserved. The video it outputs is beautiful on my dlp tv. The quality is as good as anything I've seen at any department store on any system. The reason i give it a lower rating is because of Sony's Netflix app it comes with. I found I watch Netflix about 90% of the time on it (as DVD's get old) and ever since i bought it, I've had a lot of trouble with it connecting and buffering. The firmware is updated about every two months which is nice but they still haven't corrected the problem with it. A movie can freeze up as much as every 3 seconds of play time, and be frozen for minutes or indefinatly. I usually have to reboot the machine to get it going again. I have seen many reviews and complaints from people with the same problem. Sony blames it on the fluctuations of my internet providers speed which i know to be untrue. I have had the machine itself mess up to where it could not play anything including disks. After calling Sony support, they said that it needs to be unplugged every now and then to clear the memory and capacitors. For about the same price I could have bought a PS3 with all the same features and more. I actually did get a PS3 sometime after and the Netflix on it works flawlessly only showing the software issues this player has. Over all it has stunning video but glitchy software and hardware that can mess up. I like Sony but i can not recommend this exact model to anyone.

$review_text.: I am using the Case Logic bag for a 14-inch MacBook. I've used it for several weeks commuting to work, where it's been handy, and once for a weekend trip.Before, I was using an Oakley vertical computer bag (similar tothis bag), which is a great bag, but I haven't moved back to it.The Case Logic bag has been useful for several reasons:Pros:Although the bag is designed for a larger laptop, there are velcro straps to hold it down that fit on the smaller machine, as well as a plush strap (with strong velcro) on the inside that keeps the computer from sliding around in the bag.The pocket in the main computer area is handy, I store my laptop plug and external drive there. I like that they can be right in the same zippered compartment with the computer without harming it.The bag maintains a straight posture that means it almost stands up by itself, I think the stiffness also protects the computer from external moving -- and protects it from the items in the same compartment, so they aren't pressing against the laptop.It's skinny! I can fit the bag in the car with no trouble, even when it must share space with my feet.I like all the different pockets, it's easy to access whatever I put in there by touch alone. I like that there aren't a million compartments making the bag bulky.The zippers seem strong and move easily.The handle is cushy, easy to hold, and seems strong enough for whatever I can fit in the bag.The should strap feels nice, and keeps the bag close to my body so I'm not unbalanced when carrying several items.The inside fabric is nice and soft, so when digging for small items it doesn't hurt my hands.Though I haven't used it yet, I like the idea of the strap at the back that allows the bag to fit easily over the handle on a rolling suitcase. I'm not sure this would prevent the case from sliding on a smaller roller (where the bag would stick out over the suitcase), but it seems it would make travel easier.It's incredibly light! I dislike those cases where the case is about as heavy as the contents; this bag weighs almost nothing.It looks nice.Cons:The bag is very stiff, sometimes I find it troublesome to insert or remove items. When in an airplane or moving vehicle I don't want things to spill out over the floor, so I only open the zipper over the top, which means I have to hold it open to get at the inside.The zippers are pretty soft, but there is a stiff lining on both main compartments that is uncomfortable on my hands/arms when reaching in the bag.A couple times the shoulder strap attachment has come loose on one side between setting the bag down and picking it up.I have not been carrying any really heavy loads, so the strap has worked fine, but I see in a couple other reviews people had the strap clips break on them. Since the case is designed for a large laptop, it should be able to carry what it fits....When I took it on my weekend trip, I was able to fit my computer/plug, a couple other electronics, and a couple books. Not bad. Like most packs/cases, however, it ended up with the bottom half stuffed and the top empty. It does have a couple progressive pockets in the extra compartment, but they aren't very large. (It doesn't bother me much, and is no problem with my normal commuting load.)Overall:I'm not sure how it will prove over time, but it has been working quite well -- I like the bag.

$REVIEW.: I had been researching through Amazon reviews and the AVS forums for a good upscaling DVD player. I have a Samsung 56" 1080P DLP with the Faroudja chip. So I had to rule out buying my first choice, the Oppo DV-981HD. Apparently, both these use the Faroudja chip so it causes bad macroblocking. So my decision came down to the Samsung DVD-1080P7 or the Oppo DV-970HD. I bought the Samsung because it costs less, is 1080P, and has a better looking design.I got the Samsung player a couple of weeks ago and was impressed by the picture from a DVD. Some DivX clips looked great, but some were pretty noisy or didn't upscale correctly. Some didn't even play. To Samsung's credit, it did play more DivX clips than my older Philips DVP642. So I decided to return the unit and take a chance on the Oppo.The Oppo didn't have a significantly better DVD picture. But the DivX pictures were great and it has played every DivX clip I've put in there. Even though the Oppo player doesn't have the best looking design and costs more, I am still satisfied with it.If you want a player that is under $100 and only watch DVDs, then I recommend the Samsung. If you watch DivX also and have $150 in your budget, then I recommend the Oppo DV-970HD.

$REVIEW.: Dual band WiFi, "X-Treme N," "gaming-ready," USB "SharePort" and other sorts of "features" all sound good but it is lacking some basics.  The DIR-825 is nice looking, except for the blindingly bright blue LED front panel lights.  The fact that it tries to do all the thinking for you actually makes setup and configuration more complicated because you need to learn their supposedly "idiot-proof" terms for common things.  NAT = "special advanced super tools" etc.  After hours of testing I don't think this router passes the "magic packet" to wake a server on LAN.  I think this flaw is linked to the fact that to power save the device shuts down ports that are unused, thus the server goes to sleep and falls forever off the grid (at least to incoming requests)  Wow!  How much power could turning off one port possibly save anyway?Oh well.  I returned it and picked up a TRENDnet TWG-BRF114 since I was only using it for the wired router function for the moment anyway.

The product is very good, except for one or two small flaws that prevent it from getting the coveted 5 stars.This is a case that is slightly larger than a desktop 3.5" drive. It works equally well as an eSATA enclosure and an USB 2.0 enclosure. The included screws make mounting the drive a snap, and everything just works. I've tried it on Linux and Windows with eSATA; USB 2.0 with my Macbook Pro. That's the really good news.There are a few annoyances, however, that prevent a 5-star review. First, they include these screw-on stabilizers. Throw them in the trash. I couldn't get them to be on tight enough without fearing I'll strip the aluminium casing with steel screws. Instead, the case also comes with a detachable external stand. These make the case feel stable. Other than wasted resources, this really isn't an annoyance other than aesthetics.Second, I really wish there was a built-in mode for always-on operation. You can jump the wires as suggested in another review, but that kills the power indicator LED.Finally, I haven't been able to turn the hard drive off, except via software unmounting. The blue LED unnervingly stays on constantly, and unless you hear the drive's motor power down, it's not a sure bet the eSATA connection has fully terminated. Those in noisy environments beware.

I hope when their is a electrical surge I will be protected,I'm going to ground outlet to metal box w/8 inch grounding wire/pigtail available at most hardware stores for only $3-4.

$review_text.: Maybe its to soon to make a review. I received it two days ago. But i am impressed with all the functions this camera has. If you like a thin camera style maybe this one its not for you. This camera is heavy, and a little big for the ones you can get like panasonic or sony.  Someone wrote something about a dust in the lens and this one  has something, not to big but has a little point inside.Actualization:Ok. I received this camera 3 months ago and i am really pleased and happy. The wide format is perfect to capture every thing you want and dont lose anything. The M mode let you choose the iso, aperture, speed and all this help you to take better photos. Im not a expert photographer but i think with this camera you can capture very good pictures.Some one wrote (in spanish) something i think its really true. "Say a camera take a good pictures is like saying a guitar plays a good songs".

$REVIEW.: Based on the good reviews on Amazon I bought this camera as a present for my wife. We went on a vacation and it seemed a good idea to have a better-quality alternative to smartphones cameras with their tiny optics.  We shot 900+ pictures under various condition using the new camera. We also made a few hundred pictures with the iPhone 4 and 4s, so we could make a fairly objective comparison under various lighting circumstances.The camera looks good and feels well-built. It seemed a worthy successor to our excellent 4MP PowerShot ELPH S400 from 10 years ago. Based on the first impression, we had high expectations of our new top-of-the-line compact camera.Unfortunately the ELPH 500 camera disappointed badly. The picture quality is really poor, essentially ruining our vacation pictures. For most picture types, the ELPH 500 was significantly worse than the iPhone 4s (which has a much smaller lens and 25% fewer pixels). In none of the shots was this camera any better than the iPhone.The main problem is the image quality. Many pictures that our ELPH 500 produced were simply unsharp. The autofocus seemed to misjudge the situation often. Also, the poor focus seemed to be worse on the right half of the picture which might indicate a manufacturing problem unique to our camera. In any case, Canon's quality assurance should have caught this issue. Low light performance was no better than the iPhone, while high-contrast performance was noticeably worse. The only redeeming feature of the ELPH 500 is its optical zoom and stronger flash.The back of the ELPH 500 is a good-looking large LCD touch screen. While the screen quality is great, the touch interface is pretty poor. It does the job, but its a huge step back compared to any smartphone. Most notably are the lack of multi-touch zoom and the inconsistent response to gestures. As the other reviews noted, battery life is inexcusably poor, running empty after about 150 pictures.We are returning this camera back to Amazon. If it doesn't produce significantly better pictures, there is absolutely zero point in owning a dedicated camera that is bigger, more expensive, lacks geotagging and has worse battery life than a smartphone.

$REVIEW.: AmazonBasics Wireless Remote Control for Nikon works with most Nikon DSLR (including D3000, D40, D40x, D50, D5000, D60, D70, D7000, D70s, D80, D90) and Nikon P7000 camera. This is a simple product. One button to trigger the camera shutter. To use this remote, first remove the clear plastic battery insulator sheet (just need to do this one/first time), and it's ready to go.  This remote can be used with the delayed remote mode or quick response remote mode. It can also be used for the long time exposure by setting the camera to M mode (manual mode) and when the remote is pressed 2 seconds in delayed remote mode, the shutter will remain open until the remote control is pressed again/the second time.Three additional things (general condition to note when using this remote):1. Sometime the camera will automatically cancel delayed remote or quick respose remote mode after idling for a while so you might need to set it again and this is normal (you can set how long you want the setting to stay before it revert to the normal mode)2. When using built-in flash, the shutter remote will only trigger the shutter only after the flash is completely charged (with external flash it will not wait the flash to charged up fully so sometime photos can be underexposed if the external flash doesn't go)3. The camera will autofocus (if it is set to autofocus mode) prior to taking the photo after you press the remote button so you don't need to autofocus beforehandThis is a comparable replacement for the Nikon ML-L3 remote control (i.e. both products are good, and work as it is intended). It is great for self/group portrait (using tripod) and long time exposure (reduce shake vs pressing the camera shutter button directly)Sidarta Tanu

$review_text.: This case does protect the device to some extent, but for an OEM case it seemed loose and fairly cheaply built

For a mere $10 more you can get a TransCover that doubles as a stand and fits perfectly

The TransCover also turns the device on automatically when you open it


That alone was worth the extra $10 for me because of the rather odd placement of the power button on the HD7.If you are really strapped for cash this isn't a terrible purchase, but if not just spend a bit more and get the TransCover, or you'll end up regretting not spending the extra $10 and then have to buy both like I did.

$REVIEW.: Tech support was nice, but unhelpful. The problems that I've had with this TV, along with its inconsistent operation leaves me longing for the wonderful days I spent with my Samsung DLP TV. (1) Remote is crap. Buttons are hard to press; (1A) Cannot use the remote in front of the TV, only off to the side or if I hold the remote high up. (2) Menu options randomly locked out in certain viewing modes, including 1080P, the highest advertised box setting! I had to switch BACK to 1080i with my PS3 to access most menu settings! WHAT THE HECK?! (2B) Smooth Motion -- ON by default - will make video look BLURRY, JERKY, and of POOR QUALITY. I finally found that was the cause of my weird HD TV viewing after wasting an hour on the phone with a Verizon tech who had to suffer with me. I turned it off, and the TV finally look sokay... (3) Switching between inputs is HORRENDOUSLY slow. My old DLP (3-4 years old) switches inputs twice as fast. (4) What's up with the VIZIO logo being lit up, whether the TV is on or off? Highly unnecessary... almost pretentious... For a TV of this 'quality', I would have to say I will pass on ever buying another VIZIO if this is what the fastest-growing LCD TV seller in America is up to... back to Samsung for my next TV.

Takes pretty good shots, same size as this, and costs just $200.Save the difference and invest in a decent camcorder like, perhaps, a Canon Optura 600 or similar. There are plenty of great camcorders in quality and size in the sub-compact camera category.Also,in my opinion, the new Sanyo Xacti suffers from the same problem of poor quality night shots.There is certainly a compromise in quality when you move to mpeg 4 compression.

$review_text.: A little over three years ago, I had grown very tired of migrating data, fishing various different drives for different media, and potentially losing things in the process (which happened more than once).  So I bought he BIGGEST Hard Drive I could afford at the time (which was a slightly older model of this one, but still 1TB) and just put everything on there and started working exclusively off of that from whatever computer I happened to be on. Of course, soon after I got all my stuff in one place (which was easy) I realized, Oh no, all my stuff is in one place". So I got another, identical drive and mirrored everything over to it. I don;t like things like time machine for backup because they don;t preserve everything as literal usable drives... you have to use time machine (or whatever) to get everything back out, which can be a hassle. Also I don;t need everything backed up every few minutes. Once or twice a week is fine for me. So I do a manual copy and replace at set times each week, or on demand, as newer valuable data is added. My disks are over half full a this point so the process takes several hours, but I do it overnight so it's not a big deal.  It's not perfect but it sure is convenient to have one local drive for everything on any computer and the parallel backup gives me enough peace of mind for now. The one risky spot in the whole workflow is occasionally I totally wipe disk 2 right before copying to it (as opposed to a copy & replace over it) so if drive 1 goes during that copy I'm hosed. That's why I usually just to the copy&replace;, It's just that I'm never sure how well that's really mirroring EVERYTHING. There's also risk that both drives could fail at once, but you have to draw a line somewhere I guess. I'm open to suggestions, BTW, I've been tweaking my methods for a long time and am always looking out for safer, easier ways.Anyways, the main point is that I've been working this way for 3+ years no and so far have had 0 problems with it. All drives fail eventually, but usually not without warning and that's what backups are for anyways. So far these drives have been as good and reliable as anything I've ever used. I am looking forward to bigger, faster, and even sturdier ones int he future though.

i was immediately relieved of that concern when these were delivered


if anything, the holes are too big! this is not a problem at all, except that on the exterior wall i have them installed in, i swear i can feel a draft coming through them...the only thing i didn't love about these wall plates are the sharp angles
the corners are all squared off, and they tend to make pulling cables through them a little snaggy (is that a word?)
if the corners were rounded off, even just a bit, it would reduce the drag on the cables when fishing them through the wall

small thing really, and not a big enough problem to even knock a star off the rating


these really are great for the price!

$REVIEW.: This is a really great ipad keyboard from Belkin

I am currently using Logitech ultrathin keyboard which is great and pioneer in the slim kind of ipad keyboards
The one negative with that keyboard is that if does not offer any real case-like protection to the ipad (I have had some close calls with the ipad slipping off)
This Belkin keyboard case solves that problem by combining a nice case "rubberized hard case" and the keyboard.The keyboard is as slim as the logitech one and functions equally well
one difference is that this keyboard has three magnetic strips to hold the keyboard at different angles instead of the long slot in the logitech keyboard


These appear to hold the ipad well for typing on a desk


However, be careful if you move the ipad in that position - the magnets are not that strong to allow lifting the setup! These magnetic strips also appear to act as power switches
The keyboard turns off if you take the ipad off of them!! I sometimes use the ipad and keyboard both flat down on the table during meetings - This wont let me do that
The other negative is that you cannot use the ipad in vertical (portrait) mode w/ keyboard - I normally use portrait mode when skyping.The rubberized case is attached to the keyboard and has little magnetic strips near the "hinge" just like the ipad smart case and logitech keyboard


The case hugs the ipad well and has openings for the camera, charger port, speakers and switches
The box shows what Belkin calls as handheld mode with the keyboard behind the ipad; be cautious that the ipad cant be locked in place in this mode!Overall, a very functional keyboard and protective case together!

And guess what? It holds MEMORY, who knew right?But for real, why are you looking at the reviews right now? You have much better things too do, if you want to know if this is legit, yes it is, product as advertised, other than that, what is there to discuss??Pros: it holds memory, the design is nice and durable, slides in with satisfactionCons: um, the fact you're still reading this.Conclusion: Yep, it's a memory card, it's plastic and places in a camera nicely, and makes that satisfying click, happy now?

$REVIEW.: So, I'm replacing the stock stereo in my 2013 Hyundai Veloster and I purchase this harness from Crutchfield because their website AND one of their &#34;experts&#34; tell me it fits my car
Of course, my sound is all jacked up after installing the new stereo with this harness

I call Crutchfield again and am reassured that this is correct
NOPE


 Still all jacked up
 They tell me it's the stereo that's having problems, not the harness

Well, after trying a different stereo, nopt.....it's the harness....has to be


 I come here to Amazon and see that they actually show this as NOT fitting my car
 Hmm.....Well....I buy it anyway since it's so cheap and sure enough,  still a jacked up sound
 I call Crutchfield a 3rd time and insist on speaking to someone higher up and get a technician who actually does his homework and finds that this doesn't work in my car


 Wow


While I'm happy to finally get to the bottom of my sound problem, I'm a bit blown away that Amazon had better information than the website that's supposed to know this stuff better than anyone else

 Crutchfield has since changed their site to show this isn't the harness for my make/model/year
But....Amazon is now my new audio site to shop from.

$SUMMARY.: Amazon is more informed than Crutchfield

$review_text.: This is a very nice HDD enclosure, sturdy, sexy and works without issue: mounts and can access files easily and quickly. The one problem is it will not fit all 1TB, 2.5" drives. Specifically, the WD 1TB variety. They are too thick and the case does not close completely. This was easily corrected with a bit of tape. Considering the price, I was not bothered by this at all. I was actually counting on that happening and didn't care because of the price!So if you're going to travel a lot with this, make sure the drive will fit before buying as tape is good for a stationary drive, which is my case, but moving a lot will not work.

$review_text.: Put these in my G6 after the stock Monsoon speakers died

 They worked great up until the day it was crashed into by a poor driver ran a read light and totaled it

 I wanted to get them back out but it takes too much effort to remove the rear package tray, so they probably ended up crushed


 They sounded great and hit hard when I had them wired up to the Pioneer 5200 HD head unit.

$review_text.: I purchased this particular USB hub in an effort to reduce the mess of USB cables up on top of my desk.  By running a single USB cable under my desk to this Belkin USB hub, I was able to hide everything on the underside of my desk.  My initial plan was to zip tie the hub under the desk, but when it arrived and I saw how much smaller and light it was, I ended up using some of those 3M Command strips (velcro like) to attach it.As noted by others, the power cable is a little on the short side.  It worked for me because of where my power strip was, but could cause problems in certain installations.

$REVIEW.: I was an early adopter of this camera and am still using it...It definitely is rugged and pretty much does what it says.  I ran into one problem -- at the beach.  The sand pretty much eroded all the rubber off the casing making it pretty ugly.  This also caused the battery case to not close (obviously making it not water proof).  Casio sent me a replacement pretty quickly for free.

Can't beat the price!My only concern was the first couple of times, I let the thing run all the way down to 0% -- and it did seem to take a while with the Mac running on power before it finally started charging the battery... to the seller / manufacturer credit I believe they warn NOT to do this -- only to drain close to 0%.Life happens -- like a 10% charge on the Mac left in standby for a couple of days... like I said, it scared me a time or two -- but a few weeks into owning this replacement battery, I'm comfortable giving it 5 start for the $$

$review_text.: I've been using public cloud storage for some time, but this little jewel allowed me to centralize all my files, programs, etc in one location, protect them while having them all within my complete control. No more worrying about whether the dreaded G-monster was going to siphon information to target me. Better still, I can access my cloud from any device in any location. With the USB port, I can attach a second unit for total redundancy and backup. One of the better features of this NAS is that it doesn't connect through your computer -- it connects directly to your home router, so you can shut down your computers at home when on vacation and access your files via phone or tablet (or another computer) wherever you are. Sweet. I got the 3Tb version and after dumping EVERYTHING I have accumulated over the last 10 years including movies and pictures, tax records, medical records (me and my pets), email .pst's, and music mp3's and mp4's, I still have 2.3Tb in reserve. If it receives a patch, it will automatically install, reboot and notify you by email about what's going on. Same with unanticipated power losses (although my next purchase will be a power-loss-sensing UPS to give it time to shut down nicely. Well worth the price for peace of mind.

$review_text.: [EDIT:  Update:  I am now running this with a Samsung 32 inch LN32D550, and it is a match made in heaven.  Colors every bit as good as mentioned below, games are immersive and lag-free, and the sound through the HDMI cable on the Samsung is superb!]You can get plenty of game specs for this, but what excites me is how amazing the colors and punch of my older Samsung 22 inch LCD have become with this card.  I'm using the DVI cable because the monitor does not have HDMI.Suddenly my photos look like National Geographic quality, Windows 7 various themes are jaw-dropping, and DVD's and Media Center TV are as rich as on a plasma.If you are into photo editing or anything else demanding great color and contrast, you will probably be very satisified with the 460.Plus, it seems super stable, and the software makes fine tuning easy.I'm running it with a Core i7-950 and 12 GB of RAM on a Gigabyte x58a-ud3r motherboard (Windows 7 Professional).  The whole setup is running very cool, even with ambient temps near 30 C.After all that obsessing over specs and just trying to get the best bang for my buck, I feel great about using this for moderate gaming and serious photo-editing (plus watching TV while playing poker!)  I'm pretty stoked, because what I was trying to build was a solid, long lasting multimedia and business software machine that could handle some games now and then.  This nVidia card is an excellent part of my new system.(Actually I'm a little afraid to load up games--there is still one month of school to go!)

The night shooting they brag about is NOT TRUE. It's terrible and so many reviews complained about the fish eye results and its true - I have the same complaint. The night video is horrible for the price. My questions to SONY is - Really? There are better cameras for a lot less and I will be returning the Sony TX9.

$review_text.: This cable isn't super high-end coax, but it isn't junk either.  It's just a fairly decent, basic cable.  When you take one of these apart, you'll notice that the dielectric is almost 100% covered by the shielding - which is a good sign.  They didn't skimp on copper to save a buck.  These don't have quite as effective of a shield as the upper end coax does, but they still shield around 95%, which is enough for most applications.If you are experiencing a lot of engine or external noise, you will want to invest in a more premium cable.  If you're a CB enthusiast who needs the best of the best, you probably wouldn't be happy with this cable either.  But if you just need a decent 18' coax, this is a pretty good buy for your dollar.  The ends stay together well and the coax is fairly flexible and easy to route through and around different things.  All in all its a durable, good quality cable, with passable shielding.

The product works fine, also takes still photos and allows you to record audio (only) files using its microphone. Audio quality is pretty good. I've also used this web cam to embed audio and video clips in emails (think "happy birthday" video messages). It easily adjusts for mounting different ways.The only thing to know, though not a problem, is that the software takes forever to load from the CD--so long that I was convinced there was a problem, even though there was not.

$review_text.: I bought a Garmin Dakota 20 to replace a top of the line Magellan handheld GPS (Triton 2000- very poor GPS)) and I am very happy with my Dakota 20
I normally buy from Amazon but found a much lower price at a major sporting goods store


At $[...]I think it's an excellent buy


If I had bought it for more than $[...] though, I think it would strike me as a bit pricey and my review might not be quite as glowing.The Dakota 20 has all of the features I need- a compass was important to me and its geocaching capabilities are excellent

There have been a lot of reviews that bring up the poor readability of the Dakota's screen in sunlight


I have not found this to be a problem at all


 I did increase the backlight setting from the factory default and that is all that I needed to do

I really don't understand all of the visibility issues I've read about in other reviews


I've used the Dakota in bright sunlight, in shade and in the early evening with no problems at all


 My batteries don't last as long with a higher backlight setting but I'm okay with that- I still get over 30 hours of power from Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries
(Interestingly, I've gotten more power from Energizer's cheaper Advanced Lithium battery than their Ultimate Lithium.Yes, the preloaded basemap leaves much to be desired but I've found that to be the case with every GPS I've ever used or owned

You will end up having to spend money for maps
Some have complained about this but my experience has been that if a unit comes with preloaded maps, the cost of those maps is going to be in the price of the GPS unit so one way or another you're going to pay for more detailed maps if you need them.My advice to anyone in the market for a Garmin Dakota 20 would be to look for sales and rebates

A $[...] rebate for this unit ended last month
Also, if you find a lower price at a competitor's site, Amazon will normally match that price.The manual leaves a lot to be desired but fortunately Garmin's support is very good.The Dakota 20 is a small unit

I like that because it can be stashed just about anywhere but there is the downside that obviously you don't see as much of the map compared to units with larger screens


This has not been a problem for me, however
The convenience of a small, really great little GPS far outweighs the downsides
I really the Dakota 20 and highly recommend it.

$review_text.: The FAVI Mini Pocket Projector is light weight, and relatively easy to operate.  The unit comes with multiple adapters for the power supply which was nice and it comes with a mini tripod that is needed.If you are planning to only use the unit to display images or presentations to a very small audience then this should work for you.However there are a number of draw backs:1. I could not get the projector to both show on my laptop screen and on the wall simultaneously.2. The room has to be very dark to use the projector, and even then the MS Windows screen projects very pale.  I found it difficult to navigate using the projection screen.3. This is not a projector to conduct a working session, especially if it involves numbers such as using Excel as it is impossible to read unless you increase the magnification view in Excel to an impractical size.I purchased this unit in the hope to avoid the standard bulky and hot projectors; although it does satisfy this criteria, the actual projection is too weak for business working meetings.Would I buy this unit again based on my experience?  My answer is no.

While this is a reasonably powerful wireless unit it has not been as reliable as several other units.  It seems prone to freezing up following any kind of a power disturbance and needs to be restarted by unplugging the power and starting it over.  While the initial setup seems easy it is impossible to turn off the guest network later by accessing it through the network.  It requires a different program and seems to need to be connected by a USB cable to work.  I would recommend seeking a different device.

 iPod dock is sturdy and the whole unit appears (thus far - nightly use for over four months) to be well constructed

 The volume and forward/reverse selectors are easy to use and well placed at the top of the unit (my six-year-old easily learned how to use these)

 The clock is nice and bright and easily turned on/off; it also tracks DST for you and time zones...cool!  My son & I listen to nature sounds every night on this and it works wonders, totally drowning out my loud, obnoxious and vulgar neighbours
 Only thing left is that I haven't used the remote yet, as I haven't found the right battery for it

I've not had any failures to record, or discs that would not play.So maybe there was an issue with a certain lot or lots of these discs. So far, they have worked flawlessly for me.I will keep using them and update if things go awry.

$review_text.: Actually this little piece of plastic for which I paid $19.99 worked and the sound from the back of the iPad was redirected to the front.  However, the basic design was flawed and the item would not stay attached.  I do not have a case for my iPad, so that was not the problem.  The device slid on easily and had the magnet been larger, or stronger, and the arms a bit longer, it might have worked.  The minute you leaned the iPad against your legs, or on a table, or any surface, the little piece of plastic fell off.  I am returning it.  Too bad, the thought was good; the design was not.

$review_text.: It does eliminate ground loop hum, or very nearly so. I could still detect a very faint hum after installation, but not enough to intrude on anything but the quietest, high-fidelity musical passage. That is, if there was any high-fidelity left.The real problem with this product is what it does to the audio signal. It filters out ALL the bass and many of the mid-range frequencies as well as ground loop hum. So much so that I prefer listening to movies/tv/music with a loud ground loop hum in the background than listening to the tinny, volume-reduced sound produced with this device in the circuit. In short, this product is useless for audio.

$REVIEW.: This is a decent back protector for the iPad that fits great with my Logitech Keyboard SmartCover style bluetooth keyboard.  It covers a majority of the back to protect it from scratches so I don't have to worry about laying it down on hard surfaces, but has a few glaring holes (four quite literal ones).First, the fit.  It's not quite 100%.  I couldn't get it to line up perfectly with the camera and the Apple logo in the center of my iPad 4.  As a result, the camera is slightly off-center.  Luckily, I am not afflicted by OCD.  The corners are also not quite perfectly fit; they have small bubbles no amount of smoothing will remove at the center of the bubble cutout.Second, the coverage.  It doesn't cover where the SmartCover connects to the iPad.  I was hoping to remove the chance of wear from the magnetic connections.  I don't think it would be hard to provide protection without impacting the viability of the magnetic connections.  It also doesn't cover the actual corners of the device.  In order for the flat protector to fit the rounded corners, the corners themselves are cutouts.  I've found dropped devices invariably land on corners, and am confident if I drop my iPad, it will leave a mark on the corner.  (The four corners are the four actual holes in coverage).  It also doesn't protect the black plastic iPad logo directly, although the thickness of the protection does leave the logo slightly recessed.  Again, I don't worry about putting the iPad down on hard surfaces any more.Finally, the build quality seems decent.  I have two clear creases on the back of the iPad; one where the black plastic at the top of the device meets the metal back, the other three quarters of the way down, I assume a result of peelling the protector from the packaging or repositioning it as I installed it on the iPad.  Aside from those and the rough corners, it looks great and seems like it will help the device hold up much better than it would otherwise.I don't have anything to compare it to, but think the cover is solidly a three-star product.  It's okay, especially wihen the price is considered.  If you're trying to retain resale value of your iPad without distracting from the looks of the device and loathe screen protectors as I do, this device should work great for you.

$review_text.: I recently got the Fuze, and was really excited about it

It looks very sleek, and it has quite a bit of space for mp3s and video (and the screen is surprisingly crisp, too).However, after plugging it into my computer, I got a series of USB error messages from Windows (never had this happen before, and I do use other USB devices)
It let me transfer files, though
I figured, "eh, as long as it works I don't mind." After plugging it into my computer a second time, all my USB ports failed, followed by total computer failure.I can't be entirely sure what role it played in the computer's death
From what I read online, it is possible for a USB device to fry your computer if it delivers too much power over USB
Maybe I got a malfunctioning unit that zapped my computer


Maybe my computer was going to fail anyway

The extremely strong coupling of events, though, has me suspicious.For the brief period of time I had it, it was pretty good, although it did freeze on me once (to reset it, hold the power button up for ~20 seconds).5 stars for audio playback and surprisingly good video playback


-1 star for the freeze and possible role it played in my computer dying.

$review_text.: Today's compact cameras offer (almost) no advantage over the smartphone cameras


SLR cameras and the new generation mirrorless cameras (such as Sony NEX) do provide better quality but are too large and heavy to schlepp around unobtrusively
The RX100 is a camera that is pocketable while giving a dramatic quality advantage over an iPhone 5s


Its beats the larger NEX camera in nearly every aspect

And it is equal or better than bulky SLR cameras (unless you need a true zoom capability).Amazon sent my pre-ordered RX100-3 just in time before leaving on a vacation to Spain

This offered a great opportunity to test my brand-new camera under many different conditions: in dark churches, bright beaches, city panoramas, pictures in musea, selfies, concert videos, etc
After shooting over 700 pictures I am more enthusiastic about this camera than any camera I have owned until now


The pictures are very good
The RX100-3 seems to do most everything right
On top of that, it feels great in the hand as its made of high-quality materials.It shoots razor sharp pictures that are a feast for the eye
The quality difference is immediately apparent when viewed on an retina-display iPad


Thanks to the large 1" image sensor and F1.8 lens it can crank up the ISO without introducing noise, resulting in spectacular low-light capabilities


I hardly used the flash as there is little need with such great hardware


In bright sunlight the built-in ND filter allows to perform some background defocussing.The built-in viewfinder is unique and turns out to be very useful in practice, especially if you need reading glasses such as myself


Popping it out automatically switches the camera on, popping it back in switches it off again
The regular LCD screen can be tilted 180 degrees to shoot selfies, which is a nice touch
Apropos touch: the LCD screen is not

All controls are with tiny buttons, making for s steep learning curve given the many options of the camera
Sometimes I accidentally pushed one of those buttons, and it turns out to be hard to quickly recover from that

This camera is not for you if you are easily intimidated by options and buttons, or prefer a zen/Apple style minimal user interface


To make things worse, the built-in help feature is borderline useless
One has to consult the paper manual to understand what the DRO1 or HDR3 is, and what the sweet spot for each is.The easy to grip ring around the lens controls the zoom, focus or exposure (depending on the shooting mode)


Compared to the RX100-2, the ring operation is much faster, allowing for smooth zooming

The default 24mm is nicely wide-angle, great for most shots

In some situations a slight zoom in is better to prevent the unavoidable distortion from becoming noticeable

Maximum zoom is only 70mm, which makes this camera no suitable for birdwatchers
I do not mind as most of my shots did not require zoom


I enabled the digital zoom to get a little more zoom range

Given the super high resolution the penalty is not too bad.It is strange that all expensive cameras lack GPS geotagging and easy connectivity

The good news is that the RX100-3 has a built in wifi which avoids messing with adapters and wires
 I used it many times to send pictures to my smartphone and iPad
That still requires a bit too many button clicks, but it does work well and does not depend on external wifi network.I did not have the time to read the manual, but I discovered a few other interesting features in the past 2 weeks of shooting:- It has a built-in 'beautification' tool for those hedonistic selfies: skin smoothing, eye-widening, teeth whitening and more
It worked remarkable well even though it seems a bit of a marketing gimmick.- Sweep panorama pictures can be shot either horizontally or vertically
I found the vertical sweep panorama to be an excellent way to get a wide-angle view without much distortion


All panoramas are shot at 1/500s.- I still need to figure out when to use 'intelligent auto' and when 'superior auto'

If seems that superior auto is more creative with HDR (multi-exposure) in high contrast situations.- The built-in flash can be aimed upward to the ceiling, resulting in a softer effect.- The viewfinder can show an artificial horizon that helps shooting straight pictures.- Digital zoom has 3 modes: 'off', 'clearimage', and 'on', where 'clearimage' seems to cleverly adjust zoom range to avoid too much resolution loss
(I have not read the manual yet ;)- Battery life turns out to be quite good
I short over 200 pictures on a day and still had 20% battery left.- The camera has a tendency to focus on the front object and defocus the background in auto-mode

That is great for portraits, but not always what is intended
Forcing a larger depth-of focus seems to require using the A or S modes instead.The RX100-3 is probably the best portable camera currently on the market.

$REVIEW.: I use this on my D90 for any action shots.  The fast aperture allows for lightning fast shutter speeds and really lets you capture the moment in crystal clear detail.  The lens will never give you a bad looking shot - any shots that look less than perfect are a result of user error.  f/2.8 allows for a shallow depth of field, working well for isolating your subject.  This lens does well for portraits too.  This lens is a monster size wise.  You will NOT be inconspicuous when you've got this attached to your body, so you get a lot of attention when carrying it around.  That said, it's got very solid construction and once you see what it is capable of capturing, you'll be spoiled.  It also retains its value very well.  Would buy again for sure, I just wish it cost less, but I suppose sometimes you have to pay to play.

$review_text.: What took me so long to clean up my hodgepodge of wires, cables, and cords? Aesthetics and safety are important to me, especially in my study, which is also the library, piano room, and yoga room. I desire a calm ambiance, surrounded by my 2000 books. However, until I bought this BlueLounge box, the floor between my desk and pedestal looked like the center of the "Dallas mixmaster" of interstates, with prominent dust bunnies collecting on this untidy collection of cables. Now, it is clean, orderly, and unobtrusive.The box is plain, rectangular, and deep, with a matte finish (I have the black one), made from fire-retardant plastic. If you are using a precarious device to store your cables, like a shoebox, it is a dangerous fire hazard; it is well worth the money to protect your home from turning into a fireball.Dimensions are 398 mm/15.6 in long, 154 mm/6 in wide, and 134 mm/5.3 inches deep, with rubber feet to prevent it from slipping. There's plenty of storage space--looks about the size of a shoebox.I placed a large 12-outlet surge protector in the BlueLounge box without needing to unplug anything. I could have easily fit a second one in there, also. The outlets or openings on each end of the box are about 3.5 inches long and  inch wide, plenty of room for the mass of cables. I tucked the box on the bottom shelf of my pedestal, and voila! From helter-skelter to harmony, all in a few minutes. It's like a 3-minute manager for just 25 bucks.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this radio for it's AM radio capabilities
I like to DX the mediumwave band and this radio failed a very simple litmus test for me
Being located in downstate NY, I tune to WBZ in Boston on AM 1030
A relatively easy catch
With WBZ being sandwiched between 1010 WINS and 1050 ESPN this radio could not hear WBZ because of the two powerhouse stations above and below it and lack of sensitivity


All I heard was bleed from the two neighboring stations


Fiddling with the twin ferrite control and trying the radio in multiple locations made no difference to reception
My Sangean PR-D5 had absolutely no trouble tuning in WBZ


The difference between the radios is like night and day

If you only wish to hear 50K clear channel broadcasts and 1-5K local stations, this radio may suit you, but for more critical applications and those of us who enjoy the world of MW DX I cannot recommend this radio

It just does not have the selectivity to get the job done, twin ferrite and all.

$REVIEW.: I just received the fan and one of the rubber grips for the inclination stand are missing

I looked in and around the box and didn't find it, so I'm just going to assume that's an error on their behalf


It is a little noisy.

not too much that I can't stand, but enough to make a difference

However, negatives aside, it is sturdy and the airflow is pretty good


I haven't used it yet doing high-functioning stuff on my laptop but for now my laptop is pretty cool.

$review_text.: This is just a regular usb charger, one of these even came with a 5 dollar lamp I purchased, and they can't throw it in with a 79 dollar kindle?  You can buy one anywhere on the net or in some stores starting at 99 cents or less.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS, it is an easy way to trick kindle owners out of an extra 9 to 14  dollars. It is Outrageous to prey on people's ignorance like this, especially with such a popular product. I can see my older relatives getting tricked into buying this.Edit: It is Currently 20 dollars! Now it is 20 times more expensive than a reasonably priced adapter.

$review_text.: This is a perfect case for my iPad Mini.  It only weighs 3.9 oz and the material is not bulky.  The auto on/off works perfectly.  Of course the auto on also eliminates the need to "unlock" the device which is an additional time saver.  The iPad Mini is inserted into the case so that the front of the Mini isn't covered by any material.  This is the same insert system used on the Kindle Paperwhite case offered by Amazon.  However, if you want to take a picture with this case and every other case I have seen you can't have the cover folded back 360 degrees because it covers the camera lens.  So it is a challenge to hold the cover partially open and take a picture.  Of course this is just something to accept with all covers, unless someone wants to offer one with a hole in the front of the cover that would allow the lens to be exposed when the cover is back 360 degrees!Just purchased the iPad Air case from this vendor:This unit weighs 6.4 oz and when added to the 16 oz iPad Air the total equals the weight of the iPad models 1-4 without a case!  I have had this same model case on my iPad Mini, since it was introduced last year, and it has worn well and is a holds the Mini properly.  The iPad Air fits into this case perfectly and is lightweight as well.  Seems to me this is a bargain compared to the iPad Air Smart Case for $79.00!  Highly recommended!

$REVIEW.: I ride my bike along  a curved mountain road and cannot use earphones with my ipod for obvious security reasons but I still wanted my music with me and this tiny speaker worked perfect for me.  The road has little car traffic so most of my ride is very peaceful and quite and I can hear the music loud enough.  It's not even necessary to use the highest volume level in my ipod, and I don't recommend it either because the quality of the sound will diminish.  This is just what I needed for my bike:  small enough to take along and loud enough to enjoy my music.  Maybe adding the word "personal" to this speaker will be useful for buyers to understand that this speaker is intended for one person and will not work on large, loud, open spaces with a lot of people around.  One of its best features is that it is not loud enough to bother anybody.  Not everyone wants to listen to your music anyway.

$review_text.: This is my second Magellan GPS system - the old one still works but did not include free map updates so it seemed like a better choice to purchase this model, which does offer free map updates.I just returned from a long road trip. and found pluses and minuses to this model.I like the larger screen size, and love that now street names are announced along with the distance of any turns.This model is less inclined to recalculate your route when necessary, and continues to tell you &#34;when possible, make a legal u-turn.&#34;  There was one case where the GPS did not recognize the highway I was on, and several other instances where it missed telling me when to turn. I always print out directions to refer to if necessary, and this time it was a very good thing that I did.In summary, I don't think I trust this model quite as much as my last one, but the inclusion of street names is incredibly helpful.In terms of accessories, the power plug goes in at an angle that does not allow you to lie the GPS down flat. The suction cup on the &#34;stand&#34; that accompanied it would not stick onto any part of my dashboard, and is not angled in a way that you could attach it to a window and see the GPS screen, so it was useless.

The cable it thicker than the standard apple charging cable and works on my iPhone 5, my wife's 5C and and ,y son's iPad mini

$REVIEW.: Make sure you get a "GEN 2" version, and that also goes for their 1TB external drives too. They fixed the time out with software supplied.  You can change it to anything you'll want.The hard doesn't have the "CD" software eveyone complains about installed anymore.  You can add it with the CD it comes with if you want.Last, sorry AMAZON, but I bought the drive elsewhere on clearance for about $108 at the best "buying" place in the store.  New drives are on the way so look for discounts in the stores that you won't see advertized in their flyers.I was able to check the firmware and it matches my "SAMSUNG Story 2TB External drive disk."  So it must have a SAMSUNG hard drive.SAMSUNG has had problems with their drive so they offer some of the longer warrantees.  So the three year warrantee for the Toshiba is a plus.  BTW, I've read elsewhere that some manufacturers want the drive back in the original boxes for warrantee service, so save your box for three years to be safe.It is heavy and not a light weight portable drive.  So if you think it is, it's not.Since it is a SAMSUNG hard drive, it is slow at 5400 RPM and 8 MB cache.  SAMSUNG drives have had problems, I had to return a 1 TB drive for a replacement.  So far that drive hasn't had anymore problems and the "Story" drive has been working well for months.  It has the same problem that Toshiba fixed with software, in turning off,  to save power.  However, I didn't need to turn it off and on again to bring it back on line.  It looks like software is the fix and Toshiba fixed it.  I'll have to see if there's a similar fix to the "Story" drive.They appear to have solved of the problems that people were complaining about with the "GEN 2" version.Check the model on the box or drive and it says PH3200U-1EXB (GEN 2) for the latest version.  Also it should also list WIN 7 on the box now.  The older versions didn't.

$REVIEW.: I listen to music through ear buds more than six hours a day.  I also listen to a variety of musical sources (Lossless and MP3).  I upgraded those poor IPOD ear buds once (for a $29 pair) and still was not getting what I wanted: flat musical response, base clear but not overbearing, maximum reduction of that high end buzz that results in ear  fatigue after too many hours of high end listening.  So I decided to go to the next price tier.  After spending the bigger bucks for these little beauties I am delighted.  The sound is pure (better than full sized head cans), the base sounds real (we are talking "Abbey Road" quality real) and the play at high volume is a pleasure.  The only problem is not the fault of the buds.  These phones are very unforgiving of the poor quality of many commercially available MP3.  I wonder if this is why Apple ships such poor quality buds with its IPOD line? The buds shipped with the ZUNE are much better than the Apple version but no where nearly as good as these Klipsch! If you listen too  a lot of music and/or you want to hear CD quality recordings as they can sound - you could do a lot worse than these.

$review_text.: This is a nicely built and well designed external hard drive.  However, the users manual is too complex and the software WD Software is difficult to follow - so be careful to review it carefully.  It keeps track of your initial backup and updated file if you use the WD Smartware software in the correct way.  I found that I was not scrolling down far enough on the WD Smartware Software screen and so I wasn't using the Backup options correctly.  I found that my best bet was to backup only daily at a specific time and to then click on the clock icon at the bottom of the backup tab and choose "backup now".  You don't have to do this, but I found it best for me to avoid confusion and also because I do casual backups from time-to-time and don't need continuous backups.  It can be used on more that one PC/Laptop and keeps the files separately identified - that's another reason for me not doing a continuous backup option.  It also only backups files that have been changed after your initial backup.Also to avoid confusion and problems - when plugged into a PC, it will often popup a message asking if you want to backup "using MS Windows backup" - "DON'T DO THIS" or it will just give you a fragmented backup that is hard to track.  Use the "WD Smartware" only to do your backups and it will track your files and revision just fine.

I have replaced three Startech 70mm fans on the SAME PC in just over a year, which by industry standards, a CPU fan should be the LAST fan that should go out on you!

Only complaint and this is half on the tablet i was using for not having a higher powerer audio output in the first place(which most dont), but when you split the sound it loses some volume level in both sets of headphones. i was using what i thought would be good, a large high quality set of headphones. And my girlfriend was using generic little earbuds. Due to the plain engine noise she could hear cleary since the buds were shutting out outside noise but the large phones i was using was letting some in since my ewar canal was not directly sclosed off. She could hear i had to struggle. So in conclusion this item works just as it was described but with a small amount of volume loss versus just one set of phones.

I am glad to have found these headphones, because they certainly convert stereo into mono and I can hear both channels on my good side. However, for some reason, sounds such as s and ch don't sound as clear as when I use more expensive headphones. And these headphones fit tightly; I have to remove them after about a half hour. Despite this lack of clarity and the tight fit, I've enjoyed hearing music and not missing any of the instruments that I know are there, especially on older folk music albums.

$REVIEW.: I bought this about 2 years ago and it worked flawlessly most of the time, depsite the occasional disconnect (over wireless) and being really really slow. But otherwise it was fairly dependable.The last 2 firmware and software upgrades has completely broken the SC101. It doesn't work sometime... it doesn't work. I should point out that if you're wired it works fine. But the wireless is completely broken. I've poured over their website documents (which currently ironically isn't working) and I've poured over their forums and absolutely nothing works. I haven't tried contacting Netgear. One look at the comments about their support on the forums and you'll understand why I passed. Well it's complete junk for my needs. I'm preparing for a trip and I'll be coming back with several hours of video footage and when I get back I need a product that works. Not a product that I have to spend days pouring over forums trying to figure out how to make it work. I suppose I had a good run for a couple years. But as soon as I transfer my data to a temporary drive, I'm throwing the SC101 right in the trash.

$review_text.: I tried a similar item from a dollar store that was no brighter than a firefly.  This one is nice and bright, and the flexible neck stays right where I put it. It does just what it says; it illuminates my keyboard without disturbing others.  At two dollars & free shipping, it can't be beat.Update 5/24/13:This product worked well until I disconnected it to move my laptop.  When I reconnected it, it no longer worked.  What's more, as long as it was plugged in, it shorted out my other USB port.  I quickly disconnected it and it does not appear to have damaged my machine, but I think I'll spend a little more cash on the next one.  My reassessment would have been much higher had the product just stopped working.  The fact that it affected my other port concerns me.

$REVIEW.: I own all vista computers, but my next computer will be an Apple for sure.  I bought this for one feature alone, to have wireless itunes in different rooms.  I owned a Roku, but I lamented for years that I couldn't wirelessly sync the music to different rooms.  Those days are over and my Roku is going on ebay tonight!I was up and running in SECONDS and perfectly sync'd music between my living room (vista) and bedroom (express).  I want to get another one soon!  But I found out that there's shareware out there that'll let my use my other pc's (a sage box) as an airport express outlet so I can sync up pcs, macs AND airports!And if you have an iphone or itouch, you can use it to remotely control all your devices too!  To think I was on the brink of buying a sonos, but this solution is so much cheaper, upgradeable and all around wondeful.Not to mention all the other benefits:--portabe wireless router when I'm traveling--portable usb power for ipod and other devices (blackberry?)--wireless usb printer--802.11 access point (this alone is worth at least a hundred bucks!)--wireless bridge to expand the wireless range in your homeI can't believe I was on the fence for so long, now I can't live without it and I've only had it for a few minutes!

$review_text.: I thought this would be a fun experiment to use my new meter to measure the voltage coming into my LCD TV and to see if the voltage varience would be tighter with the Panamax MFP 400.  I still used my original surge protector to the wall outlet when testing with and without the Panamax in between the surge protector and my TV.  I also took measurements with the TV on versus off, and space heater (which draws a fair amount of power) on versus off.  We did not have any power interruptions, though at one point I did have some power hiccups, but could not get to the TV fast enough to read the P3 meter.  Well, after writing down a bunch of numbers (gee, I didn't know voltage varied so much over course of the day), I did not see much difference in using the Panamax MFP 400.  Maybe I was expecting tighter voltage control than is necessary for good performance, but I have to admit I was a little disappointed.  It's probably most useful in a place where frequent brownouts roll through in the summer (like CA).As for picture quality, I honestly could not tell any difference in quality with my over the air antenna (in the attic) coaxial feed through and bypassing the Panamax.The surge protection rating is pretty good, but you can also get that with a good Belkin surge protector.I agree with other reviewers that  the build of the unit is solid.Overall, I personally did not see much difference at all when using this item, but maybe I have a good set of circumstances for clean power feeding my electronics.

This is for the gamer and enthusiast in you, who spends the time to do your homework and doesn't mind spending a little more to get the best of the best out there.  I have only one recommendation of a better card, and it is the FTW edition of this same exact model.  The only reason I didn't purchase it, was there was a few month waiting period.  This thing is a horse.  Put's up amazing numbers, fully overclockable, and stays cool and stable with EVGA's patented cooling system.  I would buy 2 of these over a Titan any day and enjoy twice the benefits.  It does draw some juice, so make sure you have a power supply ready to handle the extra pull.

$review_text.: For the price and a little effort, this is well-worth picking up for the Baofeng UV-5R+

I was tired of my standard battery going dead in the middle of transmissions, so I ordered this last week


When it arrived, I was happy to notice It is not 3600mAH, but 3800, which is more than double what the standard battery is

Since it isn't *designed* to fit the UV-5R+, you'll have to spend &#60;10 minutes with a Dremel to trim off some plastic and you're good to go! Just be careful and not use an Xacto knife like I started to: I sliced my index finger pretty good before I had the bright idea to use my Dremel


Enjoy, and 73's!!

I haven't had a lot of Sony products in the past but I decided to go with this because of the price and the syncing with other Sony products.  This is my first home theater system and I have been impressed.  Set up was simple and I had no problems.  I simply connected other components with HDMI cables into the respective inputs and one HDMI cable from the receiver to the TV.  This does not include a DVD Player as some do.  Be careful when purchasing, some home theaters do NOT have HDMI inputs!  When I turn on/off the TV, the home theater also turns on/off.  I am impressed.

$review_text.: I've had a few different computer speakers over the years (HK soundsticks, Axiom Audiobytes, Logitech Z623, Audioengine A2) so I will do some comparisons later in this review

I spent some time with these Bose speakers listening to various music genres and TV programs.SOUND QUALITY:-Pretty good in all frequency ranges

There is a smooth sound quality when listening to music


They are not harsh or shrill
There is no overemphasis of treble or bass


Everything blends together well.-There is surprisingly good bass for a 2.0 set

Nothing that will shake the room but enough to make a difference on your desk.-The speakers are lacking a little bit of crispness and clarity in the high range where vocals and voices exist

But unless you are doing immediate A-B comparisons with other speakers, you would be hard-pressed to notice
They are not so lacking in crispness that you would call them muddled.-You can play them loud enough to fill a large room without distortion.DESIGN:-These aren't showy speakers


There is no metal trim or glossy finish


They are minimalist with matte surfaces and look fine in an industrial, utilitarian sort of way

There is a slight upward angle of the speakers which helps direct the sound right at your ears and not bouncing off your desk.-There is no on/off switch
You turn the volume dial all the way down which clicks to turn the speakers off.-No LED's
That's a positive if you use these in a bedroom.-No bass adjustments or any other adjustments for that matter.CORDS:-The computer audio out cable which connects to the right speaker is only 4 ft


A lot of people may need to buy a longer cable such asCables to Go 3.5mm Male to Male Stereo Audio Cable-The connecting wire between speakers is 6 ft.COMPARISONS:-I did A-B comparisons with theLogitech Speaker System Z623which are priced in the same range


I was very impressed with the Logitech's and you can read my review there for more details.-The Logitech's obviously have more thumping bass being a 2.1 system but you also have to deal with a big subwoofer


The Logitech high-end vocal clarity was superior to the Bose

But this difference is not huge and is only readily apparent if you are switching back and forth between the speakers


Overall, I prefer the Logitech's but would have no qualms with the Bose if I was looking for set without a subwooofer.-The Bose are significantly superior to the Audioengine A2 and significantly inferior to the Axiom Audiobytes.CONCLUSION:-I've always cast a skeptical eye toward Bose products given their history of over-marketing

I was happy to find that Bose has delivered a nice, solid set here at a reasonable price


They sound good but not great and will be perfectly fine for most people as computer speakers

If you are looking for something of significantly better sound quality, you are probably going to be spending a lot more or going with a separate component setup.

$review_text.: I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the 'quality' of this kit - It's always a gamble with so many budget lighting kits choking the market, and I have had my share of headaches with third world lighting products that seem to have a life span of 4 hours yet require 12 hours of assembly and modification to make them work.Because of the last minute film and print work I do for my company there is never time to draft up a wish list when it comes to grip and lighting packages, so we opted to go with and use the budget ones and have used  (and thrown out, destroyed or donated) several similar kits over the past few years


I'm happy to announce this is one of the better, if not one of the best kits in this price range

This review being posted after assembly, testing, color temp, test photos and video, and it passed with flying colors.Assembly of the soft boxes is quite easy; They have all of the support rods built into the units so assembly is fast and easy, as one simply just has to push on the base to lock it into place - (it's almost like folding/unfolding an umbrella - A definite PLUS if you've ever spent 2 hours trying to assemble a soft box with instructions in broken English, or via watching a Youtube instructional video) - None of that here - I had them assembled within 5 minutes, mounted, powered and lit


A new personal record, as I figured the assembly would kill a few hours and shave a few years off my life and sanity.PROSAs stated, boxes are easy to assemble
Set up and breakdown in minutes
Light output is solid and holds steady right around 5100K (almost full bright "noon" daylight, but not quite - Not an issue or noticeable enough to even complain about, at least  for my needs) - Diffusion cloth fastens quick and secure with Velcro that is (shockingly) accurately aligned on the boxes, allowing placement without another modification
Great for indoors/small rooms where space/room is an issue
Light stays cool so structure fires and skin grafts are one less thing to worry about with these, as opposed to working with a cheap tungsten lamp that can melt lead after a few minutes of use.Light Stands: Yep

They're cheap


Yet they aren't as poorly made as the others that come with every bargain lighting kit on the market today


I have a collection of cheap stands that are about as sturdy as a few straws and dental floss, and while these aren't quite as bad, they're still cheap, flimsy and liable to fall over from even the slightest sneeze

Okay for interior work - If you plan on using these on exterior gigs plan on clamping or tying them down to secure them


Sandbagging is a tedious option, since the support arms are about as strong as an emery board.Carry Bag and pouches: Actually, the travel bag isn't too bad of quality


Normally the 'travel bags' are about as durable as the light stands, but this one looks like it might survive a few trips before it breaks down and falls apart.CONSCords are short, so plan on using extension cords


The built in support rods on the box that allow for quick assembly are probably also their greatest weakness, as I can see them bending or breaking easy, especially if you will be breaking them down often for storage and/or transport
Not a problem if you keep them set up in a small studio but TLC is definitely needed if you're a run and gun shooter
Like most boxes, these are bulky and must be broke down for proper transport in the travel bag.Perfect for the guy or gal on a budget, or amateur looking to weed out the DIY Home Depot work light kit (not that there is anything wrong with DIY) - Of course these aren't just limited to the amateur guy either - Great for the Pros too

(although a few pro's might detest the thought of being caught using bargain no named lighting) - The light does what it's supposed to do, and while we all might wish we had a cool and hip Arri light package, these will do just fine
Great as simple key and fill light for a portrait or interview, yet versatile enough for the DSLR or Independent guy on set
Throw some color gels on them and tinker with diffusion and shaping/bouncing/flagging light
Remember that while these are bright, they aren't going to transform a dark street or large area into retina searing high noon sunlight.(if you need/want that on a budget, get yourself a couple of used Lowel Tota lights and throw some CTB gels on them)For the beginner:Since they're daylight balanced, using them indoors with standard tungsten household lamps will throw off the color temperature so you will have to white balance your camera accordingly


Under these conditions using your cameras AWB will just give everything a orange/bluish tint so you need to learn how to manually set and/or correct the color temperature (if you haven't already tackled that yet) - Note that these can be used to mimic sun filtering in through a window, moonlight, and with some creativity and gels, firelight, candle flicker, you name it

Add an LED, clear or colored bulb of equivalent wattage and you can establish whatever mood and lighting scheme you feel the scene calls for.5 out of 5 stars - Not factoring in the cheap novelty stands of course.



$SUMMARY.: A great and affordable universal kit for both the amateur and professional's equipment arsenal.

$REVIEW.: Wow! The light quality that I get with this on my Paul Buff Einstein monolight is simply beautiful! The punch, the fall-off, and the creamyness of the light just elevates my work compared to Paul Buff's own beauty dish. It is very sturdy, especially with the reflector being held up by 3 rods. The grid just adds to the drama of the light, as shown with one of my photos below:[...]The Balcar speedring (for Alien Bees, Einstein, and similar) works great and is stable on my Einstein.There are only a couple of critiques that I have. The grid, even though it is a really good accessory, is made of plastic, so you have to be really careful. I have a slight crack on it, while moving it around, but I was able to pop it back in. It's not metal, but it's included, so it beats paying another $100+ for it.The other is that it could be packaged better. My first beauty dish arrived with a slight dent because of the minimal protection, but the customer service was awesome! They sent a replacement 1-day air and I just ship back the dented BD. No problem!Aside that, I seriously, seriously recommend this beauty dish. It is a great addition to any photographer at any level

 It is effective and successful both as a well designed stabilizing surface and as a cooling mat whether on a lap or table top


 It is very lightweight and can fit in most computer carrying cases and is pleasantly presented in a two-tone gray color.Its clever ergonomics are reflected in a wedge-shaped design that provides a great typing angle while allowing air flow with or without the fan working

 The fan itself is USB powered, very quiet and provides adequate ventilation whether on your lap or a table


 There are four small rubber "feet" that help stabilize the laptop while also allowing another thin layer of air between the laptop and the mat itself


 Frankly, I don't do a lot of work with my laptop in my lap (except on planes), so I find the "Targus Chill Mat" effective even without the fan on for 30 minutes of use or less.I have used this mat successfully as both a cooling pad and for its ergonomic positioning

 At its current reduced price, I recommend it to any who do a lot of laptop work and desire a very lightweight yet effective chill mat.

$review_text.: Sweet little camera for the price point.  Now you will not be selling any pics to the major magazines but the pictures are quite nice, the camera is easy to operate and set up.  It is light to hold and works on regular batteries. If you run out, you can get those anywhere....big bonus...no having to look for special batteries.  Been there, done that - so wrong. Will not ever, and I said EVER, purchase a camera again that requires special batteries. The pics are quick to load to a printer because they do not require a lot of megapixels so it will not take a long time to print / tie up the printer if several people use it.

$REVIEW.: After using a couple different covers for my beloved Kindle I thought I'd try out a sleeve and choose this one.  I read the reviews and saw several people had issues with the cover being to snug/tight on the kindle or the smell of the cover.  But the "outstanding" reviews overruled that for me and I purchased it anyway.  I like the feel of the sleeve, the pleeted is very snazzy, but it is a tight case, I have to work a bit to get the zipper around the corners of my Kindle, this I don't like.  It does have an order which I'm sure will go away with use.  It does seem to have fairly good padding it but it always feels kind of flimsy to me.  Overall, I don't like the cover.

$review_text.: Bought these for a low profile case. I had to add a IDE to SATA, but they were to tall. I decided to use these to move them to an area of the case so they can lay. The cables worked good, to bad the IDE to SATA didnt. After that fail these just sat in a drawer. I then bought PCI to SATA converters and they worked, but the USB on the units wouldnt allow me to complete a proper OS install. I didnt want to have to keep opening the cases, so I decided to use these as external IDE port for the units. I simply plug the IDE CD-ROM in (it has its own power adapter) and I am all set. These units are basically for light use. Like web, music and video. So very minimal devices. These extensions now keep me from opening up the cases.

$REVIEW.: Tremendous quality for the price.  If you are looking for something that is an excellent quality lens without dropping $2300 for the Canon L glass this is a pretty nice quality lens.  I bought it as a back-up lens for my Canon L glass and the image quality  is just as good as far as I can tell.  It's considerably lighter than the Canon lens and while I wouldn't go so far as to say it feels cheap I think most of the lens is made of plastic sans the actual lens glass.  When zooming you turn the barrel in the opposite direction from all Canon lenses which is a problem when switching from one to the other especially when you have trained yourself for 10-years that one direction is for zooming in and the other is for zooming out.  If this is your only lens and you plan on buying Tamron lenses from here on out the zoom direction probably won't be a problem.
$SUMMARY.: Great lens if you are on the budget

$review_text.: We did a lot of research on which hybrid DSLR/point-and-shoot camera to buy. This camera is a great compromise. It is compact but has a ton of features from a DSLR. I was looking for a camera that had full manual function, but wasn't too big or expensive. This fit my specifications perfectly. I really like the size, and unlike other people, I enjoy having a lens cap. It makes the camera feel more professional. The picture quality is very good. My only complaint is that the standard video format will not unload to my Mac, but it is possible to switch to JPEG format and that loads fine. I really enjoy this camera and look forward to using it more and learning all the cool features that is has.

$review_text.: My first impression of these canals were the STATIC/noise/hiss!It was faint but noticeable.The interesting thing was that the hiss was constant, no matter if I mute the volume or max it out. In other words the hiss did not get worse or better depending on the volume.I contacted Sennheiser and checked on numerous online forums.Sennheiser said that the sellers on Amazon are on their NON-AUTHORIZED sellers:[...][...]This is what they told me:"Non-authorized dealers selling "legit" product have no relationship with Sennheiser. They may get their goods from a source that is questionable; perhaps they are stolen, returned, refurbished (even though they say they are new), new, old, counterfeit...we have no idea. They may not have been stored in the proper environment (were they in a truck for an entire winter with no heat?) and thus we cannot guarantee the product to perform as it would when going through the appropriate supply chain."And their 2 year WARRANTY WILL NOT COVER you.The model CX 300 is especially easy to counterfeit judging from the simplicity in design.Even if they are real the quality may have dropped since Sennheiser has not manufactured them for a couple of years now.A friend of mine who is a musician say that there is a clear distortion when the volume is increased. And the number of other pairs of headphones I tested do not create the hissing sound. I bought a pair of CX 280 for double the price from a legit store and the difference in quality (in terms of build and the hiss) is stark.What I think is that the ones I bought were probably legit but the quality dropped significantly.Bottom line: Be careful even when buying from Amazon!!!

I use this thing a lot in the car and the battery finally gave out after at least three years or so of very frequent use
I wish Sansa would come out with a larger capacity player of 32gb or better.Well, got the replacement battery but....it was ever so slightly thicker and taller that the original and when closing the case the LCD screen cracked.....Don't bother spending the money for the battery, it won't fit

Save your money and time, just throw the old player out and buy an Ipod.

I did contact the dealer and received a prompt reply. He felt my item was possibly damaged in transit. He offered a full refund and was very courteous. I decided it was not worth it to save money on these generic products that may, or may not work, and very possibly even damage your electronics.Many people said this card reader did work and that is why I gave it a try.

First of all, i lost the cap for it within a month, because it does not attach to the back when it is in the computer. secondly, i have seen generic flashdrives at walgreens that look identical to this, I have a good feeling that this is a generic flashdrive with the sandisk name on it. But in the end memory is memory, and it does it purpouse. If you are looking to carry this around with you, select a different one. Mine says in my computer all of the time so i don't mind.

We're more than satisfied with the picture on the 63 incher, Amazon's delivery service had done a great job getting it to us, and this PN50C550 is priced and sized right, so the choice was easy.Our 63" set was reliably delivered by Ceva and this 50" example by Pilot Freight Services. Pilot contacted me ahead of time to schedule an appointment and followed through right on time. Their driver was beyond courteous and accommodating. He helped me hook up the set and the picture was beautiful right out of the box. In fact, I still haven't changed any picture settings. Like our downstairs set, it's quiet and crystal clear. No complaints whatsoever.Another terrific buying experience - courtesy of Amazon and Pilot.Another terrific TV  - courtesy of Samsung.Two thumbs up!

$REVIEW.: I'm going to post this review under both the Dell Venue 8 Pro and the Lenovo Miix 8 as I believe some people may find the comparison helpful.I will cut to the chase and say that I have decided to keep the Venue 8 Pro and return the Lenovo Miix 8. I rated both of the devices a 5 because they are both very similar and I didn't feel it was fair to dock the Lenovo just because I preferred the Dell. If I could have rated the Lenovo 4.75, I would have.Here is what I like and dislike about both devices:1. Screen on the Dell is better than the Lenovo in my opinion. For example, in the Kindle App for Windows 8, after changing the settings to white text on black background, you get a truly "black" background on the Dell whereas it is more of a gray on the Lenovo. Also, the colors just seem to be more accurate on the Dell. The Lenovo offers a brighter screen but the Dell is plenty bright for me. I was also able to dim the backlight on the Dell more than the Lenovo which was helpful to me for nighttime reading. These are not major issues but it was something I noticed after comparing side by side.2. I have grown to prefer the build materials and quality of the Dell more than the Lenovo. The Lenovo is thinner and lighter which I thought was something that was important to me, but the Dell is much more comfortable to hold. This is mainly because the Dell is made from some sort of rubberized plastic material that is very "grippy". It just feels comfortable to hold. The Lenovo on the other hand is made from some sort of slick plastic and it always felt like I was going to drop it. Also, the Lenovo made a faint "creaking" and "crackling" sound whenever I held it.3. I originally didn't like Dell's placement of the start button on top of the device, and this was one of the reasons that I purchased the Lenovo. After using them both, I have grown to prefer Dell's implementation since I don't ever power off the device. The Start button acts as my "on" button and I have grown accustomed to the placement. I thought I would prefer the Lenovo with its capacitive button, but I find myself having to hit the button at least twice to activate it which is very frustrating. I realize it must be very difficult to design a capacitive button with just the right level of sensitivity, but if Surface and many Android tablets can pull it off, so should Lenovo. Hopefully both companies will figure out a way to engineer a hard button on the front like on the iPad.4. I thought I would prefer having the GPS that the Lenovo offers, but since there aren't currently any good GPS apps for Windows 8 touch devices, I didn't find much use for it. I tried it with Streets and Trips and the program would not recognize the GPS sensor.5. I get slightly better sound quality from the headphone jack of the Dell than I do with the Lenovo. It's just a minor difference and probably just a matter of personal preference, but it is something that is important to me.6. Actual user performance on both devices was about equal for me, even though the Lenovo apparently offers a slightly better processor.7. The Lenovo offers a cheaper case and stylus than the Dell. I have found the Lenovo case and stylus for as low as twenty dollars here on Amazon.8. I was able to pick up the Dell unit for twenty five dollars less than the Lenovo and see a lot of deals on the 32 gb version of the Dell. Something to consider.9. Battery life seems to be similar on both but I can't say I have performed any scientific tests to verify.Here is a list of tablets that I currently own and used as reference points in deciding whether or not to keep the Dell:1. iPad 2. I no longer have any need for this device and find it to be too limited for its size and weight. I have handed this down to my wife and kids. The kids get a LOT of mileage out of it playing various learning and leisure games. My wife mainly reads books and plays candy crush on it.2. Kindle Fire HD 8.9. I ONLY use this device because of the text to speech feature and only when I need to read something technical and/or boring for work. I tried to "upgrade" to the Kindle Fire HDX 7" and later learned that Amazon crippled this amazing feature (you have to buy the audio book now) so I ended up returning the HDX. I may upgrade again if Amazon ever brings this functionality back.3. ThinkPad Tablet 2. This is my go to device for customer meetings as it is very convenient for taking notes with the screen size and dock-able stylus. That said, the device is a little slow for my taste so I'm really looking forward to the new version early next year.4. Nexus 7 (1st gen). Too slow and battery life sucks. Pretty much collects dust now but I do use it occasionally as a controller for my Sonos system.5. Surface 2. Love this device with the Type Cover 2 and use it as a bridge between my home pc (Samsung Series 7 Slate) and work pc.6. Kindle Paperwhite. Love this device for long reading sessions as I don't get any eye strain like I do on my LCD devices.7. iPad Mini (1st gen) Great for what it is, but very limited in what I can do with it. I use it mainly as a quick consumption device and ebook reader. I might end up getting rid of it now that I have decided to keep the Dell Venue 8 pro.Well, I think that is everything I wanted to share. I do want to make it clear that I like both the Dell and Lenovo very much, and would have kept the Lenovo if the Dell wasn't a choice. Thankfully, I have a choice and will stick with the Dell.

$review_text.: Up front I have to say that the receiver does work and the price is right. However, buyer beware that this device is NOT ISO ready. It does not have the screw in holes for the brackets from the factory radio which would allow you to correctly install this device into the dash. I looked on Amazon for universal installation kits that match my Toyota (found two) but learned that these were very poorly rated. I opted to MacGyver the install by using epoxy to attach the brackets from the default radio to the sides of the Pyle.This required me to grind down the three nubs on each bracket and then measure carefully so as to position them in the proper location on the sides of the new radio. Of course, the brackets are now permanently attached to the Pyle so I'll keep my fingers crossed that it has a long life span. I would not recommend this process for most buyers.Would have given it a 5 star rating but the hassle of the installation forced me to knock it down to 3.

$review_text.: I had never tried an ASUS networking product before, but the overall beastly specs for the price of the RT-N16 were too hard to resist for an IT geek like me.  My dad and I each ordered one for our homes and flashed them with DD-WRT.Mine had problems out of the box.  Once I got mine set up, I immediately noticed a stronger signal in our home.  However, over the course of a few hours, our laptops would gradually drop from 6 bars (full signal) to 5, then 5 to 4, then 4 to 3, and all the way down until the connection finally dropped completely.  Resetting the router would fix it temporarily, but it would just happen again a few hours later.  I tried increasing and decreasing the transmit power, downgrading from DD-WRT Mega to Standard, flashing the stock Asus firmware, and it continued to do the same thing.  I even opened InSSIDer once and just watched the signal strength decline slowly but steadily.My dad's RT-N16 didn't have the same problems, but his were no less annoying.  My parents have a Roku and frequently watch stuff on Hulu/Netflix, and the Roku always showed a full wifi signal coming from the router.  But as soon as they started streaming a movie or TV show, BOOM - all wireless devices connected to the RT-N16, including the Roku, would be dropped completely.  Dad would go reset the router and restart the stream, and then it would work fine for a few hours.  They could even do web browsing from their laptop for days after that, but if they tried to stream again, the Asus wifi would crash again.Dad kept his RT-N16 and now simply does a preemptive reboot of his router before they sit down to watch anything; I returned mine for a refund.  I thought about just exchanging it and giving it another try, but in my quest to find a reliable wireless-N router this was the fourth in a row that I was having trouble with.  Given our personal experiences with the RT-N16 I didn't want to risk more headaches and connection issues, so I moved on.I ended up punting on the "home user" stuff entirely and going with a small business router + small business access point.  It cost (quite a bit) more, but the outstanding reliability I now enjoy has been 100% worth it.

$REVIEW.: I purchased one for my mom, and one for myself. We both like then angle and the unit charges the phone just fine (thought it might supply a little more power for faster charging).However, when you try to remove the phone from the cradle, the phone stays in it, and you wind up having to (after having lifted the phone and the cradle up together) yank down hard on the cradle to get it to detach. Normally I like very secure usb connections, but as this is a desktop cradle, not a car cradle.A combination of an easier usb disconnect and a heavier base would make this a good product.It's not cheaply made, but would I buy it again? No.
$SUMMARY.: Nice unit, but too difficult to remove phone.

$review_text.: I ordered these because the current van we have does not have enough plugs in the middle section.  I needed long enough cords to go from the back to the middle of the van.  These work great and are a perfect length.  The only problem was that 2 of the cords separated easily from the plastic and made them useless.  The company was very good about the refund and I appreciated it!  I was so happy with the services that I reordered with them!

$review_text.: I bought this because duct tapping my Blackberry Storm to the windshield of my Harley Sportster just didn't seem very cool!This thing mounted easily on my 1.25 inch handle bars and looks to be flexible enough for much smaller or even another half inch larger I would bet. It looks pretty  cool if you get it up by the speedometer on the Sportster.Going down the road it worked well to display my mapping program, caller ID, and music info. The touch pad functionality through the thick plastic cover was not great, but would do the basic functions I needed for my trip.  Usage of the touch pad for finer controls like for typing will be difficult at best.I had no concern that it would fall off going down the road at all.  Mounting seemed solid and straight forward.  The padded case seem to provide some protection from normal road bumps and shocks.As mentioned previously the one small design flaw is where protected power cable opening is located.  For some reason they put it at the bottom of the unit. I suspect to protect it from rain. This means you will need to leave this case open in most phone applications unless you have a 90 degree charging cable end.  This should not be a problem because you can zipper it closed around your charging cable.  If you are on a bike or motorcycle out in that much water, and it penetrated that opening, you are very hardcore and have my respect/sympathy and are welcome to ignore this review!Overall, I will use it again on my next road trip for sure.  Not perfect but it sure beats trying to dig a phone out a pocket going down the road.

$REVIEW.: I have to state that I give the LG Electronics BH6730S Home Theater System 5 out of 5 stars for doing exactly what it says it does, and not because it is the best home theater system available

It is what it is, and it's excellent as a low-end, entry level system.Pros:* Easy assembly and setup* Digital Optical Audio output from TV* Speakers have small footprint (small speakers)* Rear satellite speakers come with longer speaker wire* FM radio (small antenna "wire" included - it works!)Cons:* Cables not included (no Toslink, no HDMI)* All speakers wired (you'll have to run wires)* Commercial network choices limited (No Amazon video!)* Limited number of input/output portsThe only features I didn't thoroughly test were the USB features, and the FM radio

I made sure everything functioned, but my testing focused on playing Blu-Ray and DVD movies in 5.1 surround sound


Kind of silly testing wi-fi streaming of movies and playing stuff through the USB connection since that's all dependent on other equipment (e.g., speed of an external hard drive, your network speed, quality of FM reception, etc.)
Suffice it to say, all advertised features worked
Your mileage may vary.For a small room, setup is pretty easy and took me about 30 minutes from unpacking to setting up and playing the unit

Everything powered up first try, and running through initial setup, including hooking into my WiFi system, was another 5 minutes or so


My only problem was not noticing that the included battery for the remote was totally covered in plastic when I popped it in (doh!).You'll get enough speaker wire included to run everything in a 20x30 foot room


A larger room might require you to purchase more speaker wire, so if you need more speaker wire they just clip into the speakers and the Blu-Ray player so you won't need any special tools or connectors (note: except for the bass which DOES have a proprietary connector)


Two sets of wires were extra long and obviously meant for the rear satellite speakers


The four satellite speakers are fairly small, and can get overwhelmed by the front-center and bass speakers if not adjusted properly


You'll benefit by tweaking your set up (especially if this is your first home theater system).Ok, as a new user of such a system (though I've "used" friends' systems) I was VERY pleased with the booming, theater like experience

My first test was with the Blu-Ray version ofAkirawhich is noted for having some pretty good mastered sound


The surround sound 5.1 experience didn't disappoint though initially I had to dial down the bass which was causing the fire screen on my fireplace to rattle(!).Hooking up my 40 inch flat screen, it was pretty clear that I need a bigger TV
The quality of the sound actually makes my TV look smaller

When I turned off the system and played my TV through its speakers, it was also obvious that I can now never do that again - the TV speakers sound like worthless toys now
It was VERY cool to run the audio out of the TV through the system via a digital optical audio cable (I recommend:AmazonBasics Digital Optical Audio Toslink Cable, 6 Feet)
Your mileage will vary by channel, but I was able to listen to one movie in 5.1 surround sound

Lots of stations with older programming just spewed mono sound through all of the speakers (which was nice, not spectacular)

Most stations came over as standard stereo (excellent, clear, loud).I could go on, but hope this gives you an idea about the system in general
I've had good luck with LG equipment in the past, and the build quality seemed solid
So, this is a low end, wired, entry level system

It's sold and described that way and exceeds my expectations


Five out of five stars for being excellent in its class


My opinion.

$REVIEW.: I hope sometime in the next few months to get a netbook, but at the moment I don't have one.  What I do have is a 10 inch Philips personal DVD player, which is approximately the same size and in need of essentially the same degree of protection.  I carry this either in my backpack on my daily commute in order to watch DVDs on the EL or to the beach in order to watch DVDs at night on the beach on Lake Michigan, in which case I carry it inside my beach bag.  It helps to protect it from damage from jostling inside my bags and it has done this magnificently.  For such a tiny case it has thick, solid sides.  It really does the trick.There are two things that anyone needs to keep in mind in purchasing this.  First, it really is a case for putting inside other things -- briefcase, messenger bag, beach bag, suitcase, backpack, etc.  I can't imagine anyone wanting to carry their laptop or personal DVD player around in this.  It simply wouldn't be very convenient, especially if you need to be hands-free.  Second, this provides a very snug fit.  If you have a 13 inch gadget, it won't fit in this.  If you have a very small netbook, it might slide around.One other comment.  This is a no frills protective sleeve.  It serves one and only one purpose, to protect your computer/gadget.  It has no pockets apart from a single elastic band.  But if you merely want additional protection for your item inside your bag, this can't be beat.  There are smaller sleeves, but I frankly find them good for nothing except for keeping your item from getting scratched.  This sleeve will provide considerable protection from shock as well.  Although I got this through the Vine Program (and therefore did not pay for it at all) I will definitely get another one of these in the (hopefully) near future when I get that netbook I really hope to get.
$SUMMARY.: An extremely functional way of protecting your laptop

$review_text.: I love this backpack because it seems to be perfect for what I needed. It holds my stuff easily (I'm just a hobby shooter) and is small and lightweight. Took it to the Smokey Mountains and hiked around and it was very comfortable. What I really liked is that you can sling it or back pack it, and it has easy access to the camera with the lense on it, without taking the pack off. It is narrow, so I expect it will be great for bicycling too.I didn't realize it is a name brand product, and there is a space for a tablet computer up to 10&#34;. A rain cover, tripod spot even attach it to rolling luggage should make this backpack just perfect for the things I do. Get one.

$review_text.: I have had mine less than a week, and now it is my favorite scanner


 I'm upgrading from a Home Patrol 1 (Extreme) and the new scanner clearly outperforms it on every conceivable level.If you're a 'newbie' to scanning, setup is remarkably simple: power it up, set the time and date, and insert your zip code...and in seconds, after it loads in the appropriate information, you're scanning local traffic...fire, police, EMS, utilities, HAMs, railroads, you name it...and you can select the types of services you're interested in.For mobile use, you can attach a GPS receiver and as you drive about, the receiver will 'see' its location and automatically load in the services you want, effortlessly!Understand that the frequency database is updated every Monday morning via Radio Reference, free of charge, so the information, uploaded by actual users (myself included), always has current, verified data.The key to full use of this receiver is with the (included) Sentinel software; with it you can create Favorites lists (excluding agencies you're not interested in), re-write site and talk group labels, insert audio or LED alerts for individual talk groups, and much, much more, if so inclined.For instance, here, a few miles from New Orleans, I created a favorites list with just my local police, fire, and EMS services listed, and, instead of using all of the tower sites for the Louisiana Wireless Information System (well over a hundred), I saved just the one closest to me


 Voila...all I receive is specifically what I want to hear, and the scan rate *screams* in comparison to using such a list with all the tower sites scanning, which slows the scan down considerably.There is a LOT of information available on the Uniden Forum on Radio Reference; it costs nothing to browse through it and see what users are saying about this incredible receiver.As another reviewer stated, this *is* a work in progress and yes, the "Siren" app to enable this receiver to be remote-controlled with its included WiFi dongle, hasn't been released yet

 But I see no issues with that, Uniden has always provided firmware updates with as little hassle as possible.As for the Uniden BCD536HP recall, there is a lot of screeching going on about sending in your receiver and 'receiving someone else's junk' in return


 If you look over the Uniden information, you can opt to receive YOUR OWN receiver back (but it takes longer) whereas if you opt for a quick return, yes, you will receive a refurbished unit with a full 3-year warranty
 My receiver, being one of the first released, falls in the 'recall' series but I have no plans to do so...it has worked flawlessly since I received it in January, even after the firmware upgrade.I'm more than pleased with this amazing receiver and heartily recommend it to one and all!

$REVIEW.: i got this for my canon S100 as an extra battery. Based of the low low price i was skeptical about the quality. When i received the battery i charged it fully with the included charger, and fairly quickly, about an hour, which charged the battery fine. Just dont touch the charger because the battery will fall out with the slightest tap. I then installed the battery in the camera and took over 300 pictures with flash before it showed the battery drained. Which is close to the amount of pictures i can take with the Canon battery the camera came with. i would recommend this battery to anyone needing one as extra or replacement of the original.

This kit was a very reasonable alternative for anyone with moderate technical skills.  The included plastic tools are crap and don't work for prying open the case (but they are GOOD at cutting skin, be careful!).  I used a sharp knife blade with minimal damage to the case.  Once inside, it was a delicate operation to get the new battery to plug in to the provided slot on the circuit baord, but completely doable!  Now, the IPOD works like new and holds a charge for hours.

$review_text.: Wow what can I say? I was introduced to GoPro hero 3 through car YouTube. Amazing footage from different angles. So after much debating with myself, I ended up buying the Hero3:white edition. Just wait! I upgraded the firmware easy.(just install java for your Internet explorer, people! That's all you need!) then used it non-stop for two weeks. Then I started to run into limitation...more like I wanted to to more! I wanted better picture quality, I wanted more fps at 1080p, I wanted pics while recording, I wanted better low light, better everything. So graciously returned the White Edition and forked over extra money for the new Black Edition!!Is is everything I expected it to be! Just better in every aspect. Love it love it love it.Only two negative aspects.(even comparing to the White Edition)1. It gets waaaay hotter than the White Edition. Holy crap. Now I know what other reviewers were talking about. My White Edition only ever got 'lukewarm' but this one was HOT!! I wonder their new, better processor just runs hotter. If a computer ran this hot, I'd be scared.2. OMG it goes through the battery. I ran a time-lapse on the White for two hrs with wifi on. Still at one bar. Ran Black on same time lapse for an hour with wifi on, it started beeping at me saying battery was low then died about ten min later.(yes, black runs higher resolutions..but I used same shots per second)- just ordered me a set of Smartree battery pack. I will just have to get fast at switching batteries.Overall I do not regret upgrading to the Black Edition. I can't wait to try slow-motion on this. White Edition could only do so much. I am taking multiple trips to NOLA and CT next few months. I guess I will see low light(NOLA) and high fps (skiing in CT) . Super excited!

$REVIEW.: This switch is a good looking, solidly built device. The plastic is accurately joined and has a sort of metallic semi-gloss finish that allows it to blend in gracefully on a desk next to fancy flat screen monitors and flashy keyboards and mice.The proprietary cabling that it comes with is well made. It has color coded speaker and microphone jacks on each end with caps that are attached to the cord with a short tether. This is a nice touch that prevents the caps from becoming lost when the cables are plugged in.Since I got this switch, I moved away from PS/2 entirely and now I run 3 computers via USB only. It took about 30 seconds for my Windows 2000 machine to recognize the device and then the keyboard and mouse attached to it. The Windows XP computers took considerably longer, about 2 minutes.Once everything is recognized, switching between the computers is very fast, and takes about 2 to 3 seconds, depending on how fast you can press the button corresponding to the computer you want to use.Unlike some of the other reviewers, I have had no problems getting my USB keyboard to work properly. My Logitech keyboard has all sorts of fancy buttons and features I rarely use, such as an additional scroll wheel, media control buttons, "internet" buttons, and so forth. These work perfectly, and indeed no differently than when I had the keyboard hooked up via a PS/2 adapter on my old KVM switch.My only other complaint is that they provide a base that gives the illusion of being able to make the product stand upright, but with the weight of the attached cables and the fact that the console ports are on the front, this really does not work very well. Even if you do manage to prevent it from tipping over, you have all these cables in midair and there is nothing provided to help keep them out of the way. I find the unit works best when laid flat.The device is functionally excellent, and looks great. After getting it all unpacked, and seeing how it is well made and how it comes with everything you need, it doesn't seem so bad that it cost $160. The delay for Windows XP and the under-engineered base keep this product from earning 5 stars.

$REVIEW.: Since the first tablets came out three years ago, have not been a fan on typing in the same surface where the screen is (like the HPs Touch Screens) as your arms and fingers get tired, so had not been too interested in one.  Nevertheless, as I have been following up the tablets and due to a sale on the Internet, ordered a Refurbished Thrive for a very inexpensive price.  It is a 32 GB model with the Tegra Dual Processor and all the thrills characteristic of the Toshiba brand.The Thrive is not the Tablet that Anne Hathaway will bring to the Manhattan office (if The Devil Wears Prada was filmed in 2012) but it's more a tablet that would be used in Iron Man or The Transformers.  It is heavier and bulkier than the Samsung Galaxys and the Ipads (due to the expansion capabilities) and replaceable back cover.  But it looks Avatar alike.The main reason I selected a Thrive vs the well rated Motorola and Asus counterparts was the expansion capacities.  These Thrive Tablets have things used commonly with other electronic devices; USB, Mini-USB, SD, HDMI, replaceable battery and a regular jack for charging, unlike the Ipads which use "proprietary everything" and accept nothing.  Even though I have had this device for a week only, have found some surprising positive features and decided to write this preliminary review.Have been running some tests and here are the initial results.  Battery life with Google Maps, the GPS on and some movie playing is from six to seven hours.  Recharge time is two hours with the factory charger.  The Wi-Fi connects immediately to the Router I use and the Honeycomb (3.2) Android system which is very simple to use as have had a Droid phone for over a year.  The Android Marketplace has now been replaced by Google Plus and the software provided by Toshiba has been surprisingly good.All the applications downloaded work on the Thrive although some (used on the phones) vary considerably when used in these larger devices.  Many of these are similar or identical to their counterparts in the OS Systems but limitations exist.  As of now, the most surprising thing has been the Toshiba Multimedia Player.  There has not been the need to install supplemental VLC or Real Players as the Toshiba does everything in an unanticipated way.Unlike other devices such as the Apple products, the Toshiba Player does play videos in multiple formats, including the classic Audio Video Interleave; AVI that dates from the beginnings of Windows in the early nineties.  This video format allows you to record and watch movies up to an extremely small compression factor and the Thrive plays them like the Creative Zens do, perfectly.The Zens were manufactured by Creative Labs from 2005 to 2007 and unlike the Zune and Ipods, they play every format you may want to record.  AVIs take grossly one fifth the space comparable to other formats.  Thus in a 32 GBs SD card you can store five times the number of movies you may store in an Ipod or Zune.  You will not have aspect / ratio issues as the Toshiba systems compensates for that as does in the Zens.The Thrives audio consists of two mini speakers on the bottom (if placed horizontally/landscape) which have a half an inch aperture on each side.  They can be loud but cannot reproduce the usual low frequencies from regular sized speakers.  But as there is a Bluetooth in these tablets, an external auxiliary larger speaker might help with the lack of bass.Internet capabilities are the typical Google ones; just start typing and you will get it.  MS-Word is being replaced by Google Docs but free software of "Documents to Go" allows you to access al Office features as long as they have been saved in the system.  Skype works perfectly but the tablet cameras are not the best.So far I am satisfied with my new toy and continue experimenting with video compression to evaluate how much can I load into a 32 or 64 GB card.  But, thinking of overriding the Honeycomb System and installing the Ice Cream one in the next month or so.  Let's see how it goes; more to come.  Meanwhile, do not dare to try new things with your Thrive.

$REVIEW.: Okay so I bought a MacBook Air, and it only has 2 usb ports, and I need to charge My iPods, and Phone
I also need to plug in my 1TB Western Digital External Harddrive (powered only by USB), and External DVD burner/player


Anyway I bought this being skeptical, (since it is only powered by USB) so when I got it I plugged it in to my MacBook Air 2011 13.3" 128GB Laptop, and it works EXTREMELY well

I plugged My iPod Touch 4G, Droid Bionic, 1TB External USB harddrive (powered by usb), and External USB powered DVD Burner/Player (powered by usb), into this hub, and everything was recognized and worked perfectly

I have tried two other 4-port USB hubs, and they didn't work unless I also plugged them into the wall
This is the only hub I have found (that doesn't need to be plugged into the wall) that works

I am so happy, perfect solution for on the go.

$REVIEW.: I was a little wary of this player because it was being sold for so little money

I bought this player at Costco for $99.99 and I figured if it wasn't a good player, I could just return it due to Costco's great return policy.Well, I've had the player for over a week and a weekend of heavy blu ray media usage and this player has been incredible.Set up was a breeze
My house is set up with wired cat5 in every room, so I didn't need the wireless feature

After hooking up the HDMI, HD sound, and the cat5, I fired up the player and I did the easy set up routine
After that was done, I went to set up and the player told me there was an update available
Down loaded the update and everything was ready in less than 10 minutes.Tested the player with Avatar and the picture and sound were incredible

Next, I went on Netflix, Amazon, Youtube and tested everything


All the sites worked fine after initial sign up
I only have a 6mbps dsl, but it seems to be more than sufficent.All in all, this is an amzing player for the price and I'd highly recommend it to anyone

To be honest, I'm thinking of going back and getting another one for the bedroom.

I can not express enough gratitude for finding this tv

The quality is incredible

I always watch my tv with the lights off


So that is why I went with a plasma in the first place

But this TV has blown me away! I feel like I will never need another tv again

If you are considering this tv, I seriously suggest going with it! It's been such a great product and I am so glad I got it then and I still have it now (I purchased the TV in November of last year).Finally, get this tv


I would reccomendrhis TV to anyone

That's final.

$REVIEW.: Before purchasing this GPS, I had been borrowing the company's Garmin or my mother's Magellan


 Each had things about them I liked, as well as things I couldn't stand
 This one seemed to have what I wanted

Well, before I took it on my road trip I wanted to get my destination programmed in

In the "Where To", it would only give me the option of changing the County or the Country

I wanted to change the State
I was getting horribly frustrated

So I called Garmin's customer service line
After a bit of a wait "it was the Friday before Labor Day Weekend" a very nice American guy came on and explained how to fix this

I had set up my new Garmin so that everything was British...lol


I had to change the typed English back to American English and voila, I can change the state

 Then on my trip I accidentally missed my turn


So the Garmin took me on a different route

And I loved it

It was better than the old way

I liked how the Garmin learned from me and what I was ok with


So the next thing I know, the Garmin has me taking all kinds of awesome two lane road shortcuts

It shaved more than 30 minutes off of my trip
I have a built in Blue Tooth in my car, so as far as that goes, I don't know
I turned mine off

 But for my needs, this thing is the best

I really like how if I'm on a multi-lane confusing highway, it shows a separate photo of the road, so I know exactly which lane I need to be in
 Also, it typically doesn't ding at me, unless I'm over numerous lanes from where I need to be


Awesome feature.

$review_text.: I have a sony xbr 55" led tv, and I bought a sony kit that came with 2 pairs of 3d glasses.  I was told these were just as good if not better.  I wouldn't say they are better, but I would say they work just as well as the sony brand.  They are definitely a lot more comfortable than the sony.  Setup is a breeze, and for half the price of the sony's, how can you beat that.  Highly recommend, and they work great.  They also come with like 3 spare batteries.  Not sure how long each battery is supposed to last.  I think I'd rather have the option of charging them (like the sony's do), but not a deal breaker.

$review_text.: I have a very nice Sony W1 digital camera with an incredible VGA movie mode (640x480 30fps). However, since I recently purchased a 480p widescreen plasma TV, I decided to buy this camcorder just for the so-called true 16x9 recording mode.Yes, it does record in 16x9, but the quality of the video is very poor. You see a fair amounts of noise and pixels ont he screen. I've tried several things:- DV tape played back on the TV- Indoor movie- Outdoor movie (good amount of sun)- DVD burning- Same thing using my digital cameraResult: my digital camera takes the same quality (if not better) movies than this camcorder.The only difference is the aspect-ratio: my VGA movies do get stretched while the 16x9 don't.Conclusion: while I didn't expect HD quality of course, I did however expect a better movie experience than with my digital camera. Apart from the aspect-ratio being good, the quality of the movies recorded is grainy and pixelized.

$REVIEW.: The Noctua NF-A4x10 FLX fan is certainly specialized but I bet if you look around you'll see they're more common than you think. The fan itself works very well and of course it's well made, as it is Noctua after all. What really sets this fan apart though, I think, is what's included with it, everything you need to replace that old or dying fan you might have. Noctua has included a kit that works very well and easily let's you use any type of connector you might come across with the fan.If you're looking for a high quality and quiet fan then check out these new specialized ones from Noctua. They also have them in 92mm and 60mm sizes, so one of them should fit your needs I'm sure.Pros:+Small and thin+Quiet+Includes adapters+Lots of extras included+Simple installation+InexpensiveCons:-None really

$REVIEW.: I originally had 2 Caviar Green 1.5TB drives.  For backup purposes, I two more WD drives, this time I opted for two Caviar Green 2TB drives.  They have worked great so far, but I've noticed that they NEVER spin down.  For me, this is a concern, just because they are in a warmer environment and they do not need to be accessed all the time.  I'd rather have them spin down.  My disappointment is that my 1.5TB drives DO spin down but these do not.  I wish I could tell in advance which drives support this and which do not.  I know some people prefer them to not spin down, but it would be good if the product spec's made their spin-down ability known in advance.

$review_text.: After researching mp3 players ad nauseum, I decided to buy the Zen Micro, and I'm glad I did. I have a flash player for the gym but wanted something with more storage for everyday listening. My music library is a little over 35 gig but I felt I didn't need that kind of capacity in an mp3 player. What drew me to the Zen Micro was the replaceable battery, the FM Tuner, the optional clip, and the ability to create playlists on the fly, not to mention that it has more storage than the iPod mini. I looked at the Rio Carbon, but it didn't have an FM tuner or playlists on the fly. I looked at the Archos Gmini XS200, but the battery is not replaceable and the initial software is reported to be clunky. So far, I have been very pleased with the Zen Micro. The touch pad seems to be a point of debate with everyone, and I agree it takes a little practice, unless you have a laptop with a touchpad in which case it is second nature. I was concerned that the touchpad would be so frustrating that I wouldn't enjoy the player, but that's not the case. The sound is excellent, the player is tiny, the software is easy to use, and the thin neon blue strip of lighting definitely adds to the cool factor. I am using Windows Media for syncing and haven't had any problems yet. This is definitely going to be an iPod mini assassin.

$REVIEW.: I'm still working on using the Kindle Fire as a tablet as well as an ebook but I'm finding it does come in handy outside the house.  While I have a smart phone I find it difficult to navigate website with the small screen size and irritating to move the page back and forth to read it so the Fire's larger screen is nice.That being said, I use the Fire mostly to read that and that's where the Fire loses points.  The glossy touch screen is much more difficult (sometimes almost impossible) to see in bright sunshine due to the glare, even if the screen is on full brightness.  That same glossy screen also bugs me when I see the finger prints and swipe marks in the sunlight.  I dislike (greatly) the fact that you cannot separate your ebooks into self-created categories like &#34;self help&#34;, &#34;cookbooks&#34; &#34;mysteries&#34;, etc.; the Fire only allows you to search your library of books by author, most recent and by title.  When you have 500+ books loaded it would be nice to be able to search more quickly by your particular grouping.So as a purse sized tablet the Fire is handy, as an ebook not so much.

$REVIEW.: This true Full-HD camcorder is close to perfection. Light but not too light, with excellent image quality (especially when viewed on a 1080p HDTV), impressive sound reproduction, large hard drive space allowing quick retrieval of well-organized clips. Great optical zoom, great image stabilization, great built-in flexibility of image recordings, excellent connectivity options. And it has a very convenient old-fashioned viewfinder too, (lacking from most competitors) in addition to the large LCD screen!Manual could be a bit more detailed.If you also need excellent still picture quality however, in spite of the 10 Megapixels, the final quality of the still images is somewhat lacking (but who cares? With about $ 1,000 you got a huge, unbeatable value for the camcorder anyway!)

$review_text.: I purchased this through Amazon over 6 months ago. For the first 4 months I only used the network features of this unit, they worked so well I didn't need to put an optical disc in the player. After using the optical drive I feel I can finally give this a realistic review.If you have a slow internet connection this player is NOT going to work for you when playing anything over the internet. If you share your connection with all your house mates in college, this player won't work well. If you have wireless networking from your city or business and don't get a constant good connection this is NOT going to work for you as a network player.For me, Netflix has never looked so good. On my 'high speed' cable-internet connection I regularly get HD feed with great sound while watching Netflix. Those having issues have bad connections. Don't blame the player for your network problems. Highly complicated technology like this will never 'just work' you have to know what you're doing in order to make it work for you.Network setup with Windows Media Center on Windows 7 is NOT for the feint of heart. The player's interface isn't clear on what needs to be done in order to get this to work. It requires some cryptic log in nomenclature we don't use here in the U.S. on our Windows devices. Good luck reading the limited how-tos online. Setting this up is not easy.Once that is set up, this thing will play pretty much ANY video file over my gigabit network. I'm using it WIRED, not wireless. Wired is the only way to insure a clean signal able to feed 1080i (or higher) to this device. This unit plays .TP files, which was important for me because my self-built-DVR records in that format for all HD video. The unit plays this video flawlessly; HOWEVER it fails to skip forward and back in the horribly unresponsive interface. Sometimes it skips too far forward, then when pressing back, it sets the video back to the beginning. So, a DVR replacement this unit is NOT.The BluRay playback is flawless and outputs exactly as expected as long as you set it correctly in the setup menu. Don't blame the player if you can't read the manual or understand that it doesn't know you want 2.1 instead of a loss-less bit-for-bit stream of sound quality. If you don't want to set anything, go to your local brick and mortar discounter and pick up the cheapest player you can find, one that has NO features or setup menus. The sound and video quality is comparably better than my PS3. I have this thing plugged into an Onkyo TX-SR876 receiver with speakers that are way too big for the space, it sounds fantastic and clear.Software/firmware updates have been almost monthly; to some this is too frequent. Several of them have added functionality. I've had the interface to Netflix upgraded significantly since I purchased this device. It's absurd to think our disc player, TV and eventually the fridge will need software updates, but that is the connected world we live in. So far in this case it's worked out wonderfully. Updates have never taken more than 10 minutes from beginning to end. If you don't want to do them you can cancel it and come back to them via the setup menu in the player. It checks for updates automatically when you turn it on.DVD playback is as expected, it doesn't do miracles but they are played in the non-1080p-HD format they provide. On some HD 1080p-capable TV sets these will look grainy in comparison to BluRay and even HD Netflix. That's the way it is, don't blame the player. You are not buying a professional-level line doubling video scaler; don't expect that level of technology for this level of money spent.The physical design of the box is a mixed bag. The fold-down door seems somewhat pointless, just another thing to break. It makes the front sleek looking if you care about that. One good thing about it is that you can add window tint to the inside of the clear portion of the door if you ever want to make the display darker. Or, electrical tape on the inside of the door if you want total black-out without ruining the fingerprint-magnet appearance of the front panel.The unit feels hollow and light, not a bad thing, but don't set anything too heavy on it.I haven't used all the features of this player. I can't review all of the features this unit has to offer. For me, Netflix works perfectly, BluRay playback is incredible, Pandora works wonderfully once set up. The network video playback leaves a bit to be desired but it is headed in the right direction.Some of the negative reviews on here make me wonder who these people are that give the unit 1 star.

$REVIEW.: When I first acquired Canon Lens Collecting Syndrome about three years ago, I thought to get a few primes, as Common Wisdom runs that primes are uniformly better than zooms.  I needed a portrait lens, looked at the 135 f/2 prime and thought "hey, that'll probably work ... f/2 will make for nice bokeh and all the books say to use an 85 mm for portraits but I've got a 1.6 crop, so 135's probably the way to go."  I also eventually got a 400 mm prime for wildlife.Looking at my three years' worth of wildlife pictures, most of the real eye-poppers... were with the 135.  The 400's sharp (especially when on a tripod), but the 135 simply blows away every other lens I own.  Yup, I do portraits with it sometimes, but in general it is my "go-to" lens when something neat's wandering through the backyard.The other day the "something" was a gray fox.  It was on the ground, I was on a top level deck with no time to get downstairs, and the sun was setting.  I grabbed the camera (which had the 135 on it already), got a few shots despite the dim light... and they're beautiful.  Couldn't have done it without f/2.Nine hundred bucks is a lot of money for a lens.  But if knew then what I know now, I might only own this lens, the f/5.6 400, the f/1.4 50mm, the 17-40, and perhaps the f/4 70-200 IS.  This 135 will make you look like a much better photographer than you are.  (At least it does for me!)

$REVIEW.: You can buy more expensive mounts, this one was for a Sharp 52&#34; LCD which is a bit dated but the rack came with all the hardware needed to attach the bracket to the mount

Installation is simple and straight forward

Once you have the mount bolted by the 6 bolts to the studs, all you need do is lift the TV and drop it onto a lip, then screw two safety screws into place so the rack won't come off the mount.Build quality is perfect for what it does, its secure, strong and simple


I prefer the tilt to the flush mount because while both mounts are good the flush mount does not allow you to install cables and make connections
The set is too close to the wall for access


The tilt model (this one) allows you to tilt the set to have access to the cables.You can find more expensive mounts, but for TV's as big as 70&#34; and 125 pounds this baby does the job
I've installed and used 4 of them so far and will buy more.

 I do make sure I have all the files backed up, but the portability have having three 128 GB SD cards with huge amounts of data is great!  So far I have had no errors or issues with the cards

 Their speed for read and write about the same as the Ultrabook internal SSD and way faster than the old PC drive or new 1TB portable drive I purchased.

$REVIEW.: A battery is a pretty inscrutable item. It's got power or it doesn't. But there are stages of discharge and potential rates of charge and maximum levels of charge which can be realized if the battery is prepared correctly. This charger tells you all sorts of interesting things about your batteries. And one of the best things is that out of four identical  batteries, it will tell you which one(s) are null/dead. That is great. It's a drag to put batteries through a charging cycle and think that they are ready for some work and then they last 15 minutes because one is dead. But which one? The BC-900 tells you the moment you put the batteries in to charge or whatever process you choose.It definitely pays to read the informative instruction book with this item. I was a little put off at first as I didn't want to think that much about charging batteries. But it pays to understand what it will do. This is a battery charger that has a variety of modes and using the Discharge and Refresh modes is important for reaching the potential of your batteries. And the variety of current charge rates means you don't have to fry the batteries to get them charged. Slow and cool is the way to go.I've had mine for about two months and I wish I'd had it much sooner. I tossed three chargers and at least as much $$ as I spent on this one. Plus I bought some more batteries thinking the ones I had were pooped out but they weren't at all. They were fine. They just needed to be "refreshed" which can take a few days if you do it slow but the process really pumps them back up. I'm just using mine for AA batteries for my camera and flash.If you're going to spend the day taking pictures in the boonies, it's very nice to have some confidence that you're not hauling around dead weight. The BC-900 will make that as possible as a battery charger can.I like it.

$REVIEW.: I'll begin by saying that I am not a techie.  I cannot begin to give any sort of technical analysis of any computer related item, including the computer itself.  However, I am a user - big time.  And when I have any computer-related item I need something simple, practical and utilitarian.  Enter the Plugable hub.  If I needed an analogy for the Plugable I would have to call it the Swiss-army knife for computer operations.  It's small, it has a  lot of ports and it generates enough power for an array of essential items that require reliability and consistent quality.  From printers to transceivers, photographic card readers to computer speakers - this is truly a muscled hub.  Of all the devices of like nature that  I have used over the years, the Plugable USB Port Hub simply the finest, an essential, dependable tool.  I'm sure glad I went with the "new kid on the block" rather than the old standbys.UPDATE 10/4/11:  I have added a second Plugable hub to my desktop system and and will add a third when I set up my third workstation.  These hubs are real work-horses and get the job done.

$review_text.: As a standalone bluetooth speaker, I would give it 4 stars. It can get loud for its size, remember multiple devices, and comes in a stylish package with different color options available (including a custom color combination maker on their website).Its ease of use is unbeatable, I didn't even need to read the directions to figure out how to pair it, or pair it to a different device when I wanted to switch devices. It talks what its doing which is a lot less confusing than random flashing lights or bleeps. Pressing the circle button on top tells you the battery state, and can interact with apps which I will explain in a sec. Volume up and down buttons are easy to press, and the overall design of the speaker is awesome.The sound is amazing too, it may scare the s--- out of you when you first turn it on because it makes this noise that causes the whole thing to vibrate, which I did not expect. Turns out it has a mini subwoofer on the back end which is capable of creating bass that you can feel. It wont punch you in the back but its still impressive for something you can put in your pocket. At first I thought the sound was kind of flat sounding, but then I found out if you hold the + and - buttons it turns on a 3D mode which makes sound a lot smoother sounding, the only problem is you wont be able to turn it up as high. On normal mode at high volume it sounds pretty good it just doesnt sound as "3D." When I sit on my bed with it you can feel the bass from it with some songs which is cool.The extra star goes in with that 3D setting mentioned above, as well as their "app store" on their website. They didnt really mention it much on the box (they do say its updatable and smart but I had no idea what they meant.) It allows you to change the voices and dialer settings. These all appear to be free as of now (I changed mine to the mobster voice). It updates firmware, allows you to name the device to what ever you want, shows you the devices it remembers (I had 4 on there, I think it can remember more than that), and a bunch of other preferences.The box it comes in is also awesome, and includes TWO usb cables, (one short one long), a 3.5 mm head to head cable (for those old devices that don't have bluetooth), and a wall plug, which is unheard of with most things (usually they try to nickel and dime you for things like those. Oh and it also comes with a cute little sleeve with magnetic flaps that does protect the speaker, but is hard to pull your speaker out of sometimes, though I think after a break in period it will be easierI have yet to use it as a speakerphone but it appears to have a microphone behind the grille to be used as a microphoneFor the price, it is a great package and would recommend to anyone that needs a portable but functional speaker and speakerphone

My dongle broke when I utilized it in other USB hub than the usual, this dongle is very sensitive to the voltage variations in your USB Hub and I know it that since I am aware that several other persons experienced similar issue. You cannot buy the dongle separated and the keyboard and mouse only work with the original provided dongle.

They are small enough to dramatically reduce the time required to cause serious repetitive strain injuries like carpal tunnel - no joking matter for people who get it.  This one is a bit bigger than others I think, but still painfully small.Also this mouse rocks left and right a bit on a hard surface, since the bottom is not completely flat.I'm returning this and am giving up on the idea of using bluetooth to save a USB port on my laptop.

$review_text.: I have this speaker and love it.  I take it everywhere with me.  My girls play softball and I use it at all their games for music in between innings and throughout the day while we are waiting for our next game to start.  I also have a pool and we use it by the pool all the time.  I haven't been to the beach yet but plan to go in July and can't wait to take this with me on the beach.  My kids all have iphones and they all know how to connect to the bluetooth connection on this speaker.  It's very easy to use.  We've had it in the rain at softball games and it did great.  I have poured water over it just for fun to watch it bounce off the speaker like they do on the braven you tube video.  Again, I love this speaker, however I do have some disappointments with it.Reason for 1 star deducted:#1--It just doesn't seem to get loud enough for me.  Yea it's fine if you are right by it but It's not gonna put out a huge amount of volume.#2---The 2 way adhesive tape that holds the cap to the tie.  I plug my speaker up to 110 plug outside by the pool so that we don't have to use the battery so it's vital that you attach the cap (back cover) to the tie string so you don't loose it.  My kids had it out by the pool one day when I was at work and when I came in they had brought the speaker back in but it didn't have the cap on it and it wasn't attached to the string.  The heat had caused the 2 way tape to release and my cap was no longer attached.  I panicked!!!  I went outside and there was the cap laying on the ground near the sidewalk.  Now I will say had anyone else picked it up they wouldn't have know what it went to and it would have probably been thrown away so i'm so glad I went out right away and found it.  After that I glued it on with some EZ6000 glue so I don't see that sucker coming back off again, or at least I hope it doesn't.  In all it's a good little speaker.  I carry mine in one of my Vera Bradley trio zipper pouch and put the cord and an extra iphone5 and iphone4 usb cord in there as well, however I haven't used the charging feature yet.  I look forward to using that feature but I don't plan on depending on it too much.****Update***  speaker dropped into the pool and got completely wet because it was sitting next to the pool wall and bounces a little when its turned all the way up.  Still works great!!!!
$SUMMARY.: Great for the pool, beach, and softball tournaments

Looking around at local stores, all I could find were cases for Kindle and iPads, except at Walmart which had a decent case for Nexus 7 for $40. I also looked online, and saw this product, which looked sturdier than the one at Walmart. For only $12, I went ahead and risked it. So far, I am very pleased. Hard back and front, magnetic flap which turns the display on/off, and even a little stylish.My only dislikes are too little padding on the inside, and the case now makes the Nexus too big to fit in my coat pocket.

$review_text.: I bought one of these to replace a 30-year-old full-sized UHF/VHF rooftop antenna

The old antenna works great with HDTV, but it was beginning to deteriorate from age


The C2-V is no better than the old antenna, but it certainly is a lot smaller and lighter weight


If your space is limited or you have an odd mounting location or you think those old-style antennas are too ugly or difficult to install, then give this a try
I bought a refurb for a bargain price and it seems to work just as well as the old antenna (mounted on the same pole)

There is a mini mounting pole in the box, but I'm sure the antenna will work better on standard rooftop antenna pole.

Like many others I upgraded the low end model to 4GB of RAM and put in a 330GB 7200 rpm hard drive. Snow Leopard made an excellent computer even better. I'm a creative professional and use it for Web design, photography and the like (Adobe CS3, Aperture, iWork, etc), though I haven't attempted to do much in the way of serious video editing yet. I have two monitors connected to it, along with several peripherals (scanner, drives, audio mixer, etc), and it doesn't skip a beat.

$REVIEW.: Purchased the Powershot A75 after extensive research approximately 2 1/2 years ago.  Excellent everyday use camera (great photos and great ergonomics) for those who do not want an SLR.  I was completely satisfied with the product until the display went bad on December 25, 2006.  Display went dark with flashing horizontal lines and no photos could be taken.  Since the camera was out of warranty, I decided to look for a new camera as repairing it would not be cost effective.  While checking the new Canon camera line on their website, I found a Powershot A75 service advisory related to my problem.  In addition, the advisory stated that Canon would pay for the shipping and repair the camera for free, regardless of the warranty status.  I called Canon and spoke with a representative on December 26, 2006 and was told to mail the camera in for repair.  Canon emailed me a prepaid UPS label and a service request the very next day.  I shipped the camera to Canon on December 28.  On January 3, 2007, I received an email from Canon stating the camera was received for repair.  Also included was a link to their service center where I could track the repair progress.  Estimated time to repair and return the camera was 10 working days.  On Jannuary 11, I received an email staing camera was shipped on the 10th and would be delivered on the 12th.  Fedex delivered the camera mid-morning on the 12th.  The enclosed invoice (NO CHARGE) indicated Canon had replaced the CCD unit, updated the firmware and cleaned the camera.  Checked out the camera and everything is working perfectly.  This is OUTSTANDING customer support! Will I buy aother Canon product?  ABSOLUTELY.

$REVIEW.: The main reason that I bought this lens hood is that it screws on and that it comes with a cap that goes on the front of the hood.  With the standard lens hood on my Canon HF G10, I have a hard time putting on and taking off the lens cap.  This DV-s58 screws right on to my ND filter and appears of reasonably good quality.  The lens cap that goes on the front of the lens hood rather than the lens itself is nice.  Makes the camera a bit more professional.  The only problem I have, which makes this lens  hood unusable, is that when zoomed out completely, the edge of the lens hood is seen on the captured video.  Basically I lose the wide angle use of my camera.  I would recommend this lens hood, just keep in mind how wide angle your lens is.  Additionally, my hood did not come with a white balance cap.

$review_text.: I'd read a number of reviews stating what great, quiet fans the Noctua is, so I guess I was expecting a lot. However, once installed it was not nearly as quiet as I'd hoped (I'm using it on a Windows Home Server which is running 24/7 so I wanted as quiet as possible). I suspect a lot has to do with it being an 80mm model, though I did install a 120mm one on the back of the case and it was louder than the fan it replaced. On paper the specs look great and if the fan has the lifespan quoted, then it'll be a great fan. Just be aware that quietness is subjective and one person's quiet may be another person's noisy!

It was also one of the least expensive modems I could buy on Amazon.com.  Because it is the same model as I was renting, the conversion was very easy.  I was concerned that Time Warner Cable would have problems with 'unsupported' models.  Using the same model eliminated that possibility.A word of caution, make sure to check your cable bill to verify that they have ceased billing you for modem lease, and make sure to get a receipt when returning your leased modem.Maybe in a few years I will upgrade and get a DOCSIS 3.0 or newer modem when faster speeds are available in my area.  However, for now, I am very satisfied with my modem and it has provided reliable service for me so far.
$SUMMARY.: Great modem for the price

$REVIEW.: We had a Garmin suction cup mount (for our Garmin Nuvi 350) for about a year. The mount worked great, until it broke. It's an elegant, flexible item, but be careful with the swivel feature; over time the stress on the swivel can break the connection to the base.

$REVIEW.: The only comparison I can draw is to my wife's Otterbox for her phone, but this iPad case provides protection superior to the Otterbox with the addition of a detachable BT keyboard.The good:1. Shell and case fits the iPad perfectly, providing exceptional protection and is very well built. Every port is covered and protected.&#8226; Rubber controls lay on top of iPad controls to protect them and allow access without having to remove the case.&#8226; NOTE: In order to plug things in you will need to pop open the individual cover for that port. Does not say on the package but seems highly water resistant.2. As with all NewTrent keyboards I have ever owned, the BT keyboard pairs easily and is very responsive, all of the controls work well (including apple controls) and the key spacing is comfortable for someone with medium/large hands.&#8226; These are the features that initially attracted me to their products when I bought my first iPad and they have continued to enhance the cases with additional features from there.3. Case is well textured and has a nice comfortable feel to it.&#8226; This addresses a concern I have raised on several NewTrent products I owned previously. I felt the cases were too slick or &#34;plasticky&#34; and were going to slide out of my hand if I did not have a tight grip, not with this case.4. The iPad is housed on a steel arm that articulates 360 degrees with stops at each ~45.&#8226; The arm is detachable and you can use it within the case (on a table or in your lap) or detach the arm completely with the iPad attached and sit it on the table in front of you.&#8226; Unlike previous NewTrent cases, the arm is stiff and easily holds its position without slippage over time.&#8226; The iPad can be removed from the arm completely if you want to just hold and do not need the keyboard.The Middle:Protection comes at the price of additional weight and thickness. The iPad feels like a brick pretty quickly if you intend to hold it rather than sit it on a table or in your lap. Depending on a person's utilization this could become frustrating pretty fast. This is somewhat reduced by the fact that you can remove the keyboard when you do not need it, but even detached the iPad is more than twice as thick and heavy.The Bad:1. There is no LED to indicate whether the keyboard is on/off.&#8226; The trick is to press the CAPs lock button... If the Keyboard is ON, the LED will stay on. Also, when you turn the unit off the CAPS lock LED flashes. Don't recall seeing this in the instructions.2. Cover for button on bottom of iPad is a little too stiff. Requires too much pressure to get it to respond.3. I love being able to remove the iPad from the keyboard when I want to use standalone, but feel like I lose much of the protection provided by the case as I have nothing to plug the hole where the arm detaches from the back of the iPad.&#8226; I would suggest they include a disc that can be inserted to maintain the seal and protection in the future.4. Screen protector issues&#8226; Too shiny causing light reflection from lamp behind me.  This was also true outdoors with sun glare.&#8226; Does not stay flush with screen causing a tapping sound and a visible distortion sometimes.&#8226; Sometimes seeing a rainbow behind screen protector (likely related to previous issue) like there is water in between the screen and the protector.&#8226; I know this is not the case because I reopened the case after I first saw this and used a shammy to make sure both the screen and the protector were dry but it did not go away.&#8226; I think it has to do with the fact that it is not staying flush.

$REVIEW.: This review is for the AcuRite 08580 Weather Station Plus Portable Weather Alert Radio.  We love it!!!  Bought this to sit in the bedroom, so we would hear alerts at night and have an idea of the day's weather when getting dressed in the morning.  It does the job and very accurately, too!  It was a bit tricky setting it up, but after reading the manual carefully; we figured it out.  We hung the sensor outside on the north side of the garage under the soffit.  It is about 80 feet or so from the main unit.  Works great!  We have since purchased two more AcuRite weather stations for other levels of our home and made sure we bought ones that use the same sensor, so we save on batteries.  We will save those 2 unused sensors for spares, if the one outside goes bad.  The weather radio is loud and clear, has very good reception and can be set for a wide variety of alerts, warnings, watches, local emergencies and the like.  We live on the fringe of 3 NOAA broadcast stations.  We used to have a Midland weather radio that got such poor reception that it was useless; so we got rid of it.  This AcuRite one is totally different.  Both the sensor and the radio seem to get excellent reception compared to other brands we've tried.  I put a small lanyard through the hole near the radio antenna to make it easier to hang on to, if we need to grab it quickly and run to the basement.  The belt clip seems just a bit flimsy, but the rest of the weather station and radio are sturdy.  It's nice to be able to hear the current forecast anytime at the touch of a button.  We would buy this unit again.
$SUMMARY.: We Just Love It!!!

$review_text.: So this is how my modest sound system is setup.  Originally the RCA audio cables fed from the TV to my Griffiin Evolve speakers,  They both have left and right (red & white) female ports.  The Griffin speakers give me the option to select either Mono or Stereo sound.  Of course with stereo, I can distingushly hear the left and right channels from my speakers.  My speakers only have on set of audio inputs ports.  I wanted these piggyback cables so I can also run my Airport Express into those speakers as well without having to swap cables.  The two main issues I ran into with theses cables happen when It was all setup:1) Because the Airport Express output doesn't have a dedicated left and right female port, the default sound was mono, even if the song was recorded as stereo. That's fine, however the piggyback cable will always prioritize the piggybacked source so it was always mono sound even if the sound was coming from the TV which had dedicated left and right (red & white) outputs.  I have to disconnect the RCA male end of the cable running to my Airport Express every time I want to hear stereo sound from my TV.2) the other flaw also came from its prioritization.  It will always prioritize the volume level of the piggybacked source, which in my case is a lower volume setting from the Airport Express.  I have to again disconnect the piggybacked cable every time I want to hear the full sound from my TV.If you're very picky about the sound setup, then i wouldn't recommend this cable.  I'll have to deal with this setup until I can a more useful solution and seeming how inexpensive it is, it's not really worth returning.

$review_text.: It has been already about four days that I have been trying, from time to time, to place this camera, so that I can watch the feed through the Internet away from home. If you do not know much about dynamic ip and such, you will be going to school for a while if you try to do it your self. I have given up because I have a NetGear router model # DNG2200, and the menu to set the camera is not like in the instructions that I have read here, and I hate to call technical support, since the technical support for the NetGear is really poor and frustrating. I will have to call my ISP and go to the EasyN website for support information. However, if any one reading this can help me, that would be great. I am pretty sure that I am not the only one with this type of router.So the only part I could not pass through, is when it states "before outer access, please refer to your router's user's manual for how to open ports to allow Internet access to the camera." You have to really know what you are doing here.Okay, I finally manage to connect it to the Internet. Once it is connected, it appears to respond pretty good. So, I have no idea what is the difference between this ip cam and others that are more expensive. When it comes to working, so far I would give it five stars, exempt I do know how long these cameras last without any problems. I guess you could know that from other reviews. I really do not care that the colour is not very close to reality. It is an ip cam; no one is going to use it to take family movies, just for secutity and piece of mind.

$review_text.: I've had a 6 gig Nomad Jukebox for about a year now.  It's been a love-hate relationship.  The battery life is abysmal--the first unit I got from Amazon wouldn't hold a charge long enough to boot the machine up, and the one that Amazon sent to replace it is only marginally better.  Think of the Nomad as only quasi-portable, because battery life really sucks; the problem is compounded by the unit's boot-time battery life check.  It will often fail this test when there is plenty of juice in the box. The supplied PlayCenter software stuttered and faltered on Windows 2000, making it tricky to download more than a few files at a time.  And the Creative website was amazingly little help--they seem to have no clue on making PlayCenter useful to people.  The UI of the player itself is quirky and gets sluggish when you start to fill up the hard disk, but I can't really complain about it.But having said that, the unit works well once you get your tunes in there and don't stray far from a power outlet.  I keep it by my desk and hardly ever touch a CD anymore.

$REVIEW.: I can concur with the majority of reviews which heavily influenced me in buying these phones. I had previously used wireless RCA and Sony. These R120's are easily the best I've owned and tremendous value, PROVIDING you don't move your head, as they too easily shift and fall off your bonce (London lingo for head...).I was aware this may be a problem, but having a head as big as mine, I thought that would not affect me, but it does! These phones are very comfortable and ideal for sitting or relaxing listening to your sound. But forget doing housework or washing up (the dishes to you yanks!!:).They should have made these to at least have fitted your head so you can move around. So to summarise; if you want great sound, go for these great performing phones, if you want to move your head, forget it! I don't have the hiss problem by the way some people have complained of.I'm still pleased I bought them, the performance is brilliant considering the price.

$review_text.: Enough has been said in other reviews about RoKu products.  This review is about Distributing RoKu programming throughout your home. This can be done with RoKu-2XD but not with RoKu3.WHOLE-HOUSE NetFlix and Amazon-Prime movies:Add a Modulator and the RoKu Remote Control phone app and you're set to go. Like most homes we have a main TV plus a mix of old TVs in other rooms. COAX wiring is already in the house for Cable TV and our old Antenna. Being able to watch RoKu programming from the Kitchen, Bedroom or where-ever adds a lot of value for us.If this appeals to you, this is a guide to the key points about this setup.1. Get a good modulator. A $58 ChannelPlusCHANNEL PLUS 5415 Single Channel Rf Modulatorwill provide MUCH better picture quality that a cheap modulator. We started with a $28 RadioShack modulator which works OK for old Analog TV's but not so great if tuning in with a HiDef TV.2. Plan on using the RoKu Remote Control app on your phone . . it works great. This is neccesary because the RoKu2 remote is IR so it won't work from other rooms. The RoKu phone application uses WiFi so your phone has to be on the same WiFi connection as RoKu. The only probelm with the RoKu phone app; if your phone rings you can't get to the RoKu controls to pause RoKu before you answer the call.3. One Complication: RoKu-2 does not support HDMI and RCA output at the same time, so if RoKu is connected to your main TV you can't modulate the RCA outputs.  To solve this problem we have a RoKu-3 connected to our main TV with HDMI and the RoKu-2XD is only connected to the ChannelPlus modulator using the RCA output. Of Course you could unplug HDMI cable on the RoKu2 to watch in other rooms but HDMI connectors don't hold well after being plugged and unplugged alot.4. Depending the quality and the extent of your COAX cabling, you may need a COAX amp to boost the signal from the modulator.  This is another advantage with the ChannelPlus units.  The cheap modulators have a much weaker output signal intended for a single TV, not for whole-house distribution. The ChannelPlus modulator will work without an amplifier in most cases.  If you see any "noise" in the picture, get an amp. We used an amp left-over from our Comcast Cable TV setup . . which was just replaced with DishTV.  In addition to better picture quality, the need for a COAX amplifier may further justify the additional cost of using a ChannelPlus modulator, which probably won't need an amp.If you try this  . . enjoy.PS: 16x9 picture format from RoKu will make people look skinny when you tune-in with an old 3x4 TV. If you have a HiDef TV in some other room, you will get a full 16x9 well-formatted picture.
$SUMMARY.: "Whole-House" RoKu is possible with RoKu-2XD . . . not with RoKu3

$REVIEW.: I would definitely NOT pay more than like $2 for this. I'm sad I did pay more. Its a very thin case that im afraid the first time I drop it, it will probably break. How the original price of this is $30 i have no clue! Thats wayyy ridiculous. Its a really thin cheap piece of plastic that probably shouldn't cost more than $1 but since the ipods are new they can charge whatever they want. In general yes it fit my ipod fine and its a nice color. The case is higher than the volume and the power button so you kinda have to stick your nail in to reach the buttons thats a bit annoying.

$REVIEW.: You'll find exhausting reviews of this camera elsewhere.  Here's the thing: Every time I look into a new camera I seem to wind up with a Sony.  I have purchased a few Sony's, from their professional SLR digital, vacation pics digital SLR, point-and-shoot, and a few, ever-shrinking video cameras.  They seem always to come in with slightly better technology and decidedly better picture quality.  To my eye this was, in spite of its insipid name, another instance of Sony coming in with better electronics, a superior lens, and their usual superb color balance, light and focus control, and all for less than the other guys.  And it has GPS which I think is always a great addition to digital photography.  Good stuff Maynard.

First of all, the sound quality falls short in comparison with similar Sennheiser products available. Sennheiser does a far superior job, especially with the mids and lows. The earphones really hurt my ear when I have them on for more than five minutes. The volume control is pretty nice but that alone is not enough to warrant a purchase. I would recommend buying a Sennhesier CX-500B for less than a third of the price and you will much happier with the results.[...]

$review_text.: I was hesitant to purchase this product for two reasons; First, I cut my photographic teeth on early model Asahi Pentax SLR's, of which all the interchangeable lenses utilized lens caps. At that time I was used to them and I thought I would get used to them again on the LX7 never realizing that after having owned a series of great Panasonic p&s; models I became spoiled at the convenience of not having a lens cap to mess with. Second, I thought the auto lens cap would dramatically detracted from the sleek look of the LX7. It hasn't. After having missed more than a couple shots fiddling with the stock lens cap I ordered this auto version. If you're an LX7 owner, I suggest you do the same and never look back.The cap arrived in no time at all and was very simple to install. After you twist off the lens ring simply twist on the lens cap until it locks itself onto the camera with a definitive click. It is removes the same way you twisted off the lens ring, only easier.The only gripe I have about this cap, and it's a small one, is that the three flap hinges protrude enough to interfere with the operation of the aperture control ring on the camera. You can still operate the ring easily enough, you simply need to grasp it differently than you normally would.This cap truly enhances the enjoyment of owning and operating the wonderful Panasonic Lumix LX7.

Some will complain that the wire is not stiff enough when they hook it up. Come on people, use a bit of common sense, you don't need to strip off a bunch of the wire, just 1/8th inch is plenty and twist the wire a bit, it'll be plenty stiff.Other than that, excellent wire, the insulation is good as well the white strip for marking the ground is quite visible, it's not an eyesore, from a foot away you can't tell which wire is which, but it's visible enough when you're hooking up your speakers. The wire also lays really nice. Just make sure to use the flip coil method of rolling it up if you do store any sections you've cut off the main roll. ( Google it if you don't know what I'm talking about )

$REVIEW.: This was purchased solely for playing games on Steam. Works fine for me, I'm used to the trackball design for mice and can't be bothered with running out of desktop space. I actually use this for my laptop when I LAN over at a friend's house.&#9733;Requires dry cell batteries, which is what I was looking for. I hate recharging things.&#9733;Compartment inside the battery fuselage for storing the mini USB adapter so you don't lose it.&#9733;Fairly small, yet comfortable enough to fit in my hand, which is normal sized. I keep it in a side pocket in my messenger bag.&#9733;Yes, there is an On/Off switch. Unlike some mice that just go into standby after a time period.&#9733;The trackball itself is removable, just shove your finger through the bottom and it pops out, allowing your to clean the inside. It does meet enough resistance not to dislodge itself when held upside down.&#9733;If you play first person shooters, make sure you disable the touch scroll wheel on either side of the trackball. There's usually a setting in every game that allows you to remove the hotkey for weapon switching, or to change it to something else, like PageUp/PageDown. The scroll is so sensitive that even a tap will turn your gunfight into a stab-fest unintentionally. I usually end up dying because I accidentally switched to my knife during a gunfight, or something along the lines of that.Hope this helps with your purchase, or otherwise. If you were looking for something fancier like a Razr mouse, sorry to disappoint you. Works fine for me.

I was taking around a 1000 shots per day, mostly jpeg and a mixture of jpeg +raw, with a few flash shots thrown in.  There was still battery power left at the end of the day.

$REVIEW.: I had just purchased a new Smart TV and of course to put on the wall, the HDMI plugs come out the right side and the wires needed to be bent back.  It took me a while to make the spatial leap, but after making a drawing and trying to visualize how these adapters would work, I finally ordered them.  Even as I was removing them from the packaging, I was doubting whether they would work, but they did.  Perfect.  Now my cables come straight out the back and into the low voltage box behind the screen.  They work fine, no problems with sound or DVD. Very happy.  So I have a 32&#34; Samsung 6300 for reference.

$review_text.: Last night I was at home, waiting for trick-or-treaters


My wife usually deals with them, but when her friend called, I took over candy duties


The doorbell rang, and, candy tray in hand, I opened it.Outside there was some kid in a spaceman's outfit, about four feet tall


The outfit was so good that you could see many details, and the visor of the helmet was tinted so I couldn't see the face


I exclaimed, "What a great outfit!" but I noticed that there weren't any adults with this kid


Then it pressed a button on its suit, and although there was no sound, I could hear things in my head."Greetings," it said, "I come from the future

I have brought this for you

It's a router - we've had to dumb it down so that it works with your primitive computer
There are instructions inside," and it handed me a box marked "Netgear." I stood there for a second, and then said "Wow! You must really come from the future.""Just connect this in place of your present equipment," it said


I asked, "But why are you bringing this to me?" The creature sighed
"Sometimes technology doesn't advance fast enough
How many people say you can rely on a wireless network? Hardly anyone


So we're bringing this to your planet to speed things up


We'll offer it for sale on-line and in stores, and with your exalted status as a Vine reviewer you will tell people how good it is.""Well, I'll have to try it first," I said


"Of course," the creature agreed
"I wish it were cheaper," it said, "but the shipping costs to your planet are astronomical." "But why did you come around tonight?" I asked


"It's Halloween" said the creature, "the only night we can come around in our suits and no-one will notice." Then the creature said, "Er, um, there is one other thing
On our planet we don't have candy as good as M & Ms
Do you have any?"I found some and gave them to it

It waved its arm, and I could have sworn there was a smile behind the tinted visor


Then it turned, and walked across the road, and became more and more transparent till it vanished


My wife walked in

"Who was that?" she asked, "And what's this?" looking at the box


"Oh, er, it was the UPS man with something from Amazon to review," I said


She said, "Why is there no Amazon box," and I heard the voice in my head for the last time, and I repeated what it said, "The Amazon box was damaged in transit, so they just wanted me to see it rather than just leave it."This morning I had forgotten about the creature from the future, but when I walked out into the living room the box was still there


I opened it, and my first thoughts were that it was incomplete with no CD and hardly any instructions

But I followed the instructions and really didn't need a CD, and it was working from the moment I turned it on.And what a performance! I went from three signal strength bars to five, and although I haven't tested it yet, it seemed faster downloading


It has something that all routers should have - USB ports
There are two of them, in fact, one for a networked hard drive, and one for a printer


That's in addition to the four Ethernet sockets, which have Gigabit capacity

And when I set the router up, it automatically put me in WPA security mode


The last router would work without protection, but wouldn't connect if you had protection switched on.Compared to most other routers, this is huge
That isn't much of a problem - at the moment it's lying on its side

I want to fix it to the top of the TV and tell people it's an award I was given.So if you want a router that works like a router, this is the one

And keep some M & Ms handy.

$review_text.: Original Review:This is a complete waste of time.  I can imagine the discussion at Apple when they were conceiving this product.  "I've got it:  how about we make a box that people will buy from us and the only thing they can do with it is use it to buy other stuff from us that they could otherwise get for free!"  That's about it.  Save your money until Apple or someone else comes up with a device that truly integrates content from the web with your TV.  This definitely is NOT it.Reappraisal (3/11):I've been using this a lot more since I cut my cable, and I am appreciating it much more.  I use it to get a lot of great shows that I only pay for when I want to watch them.  I actually like it better in some ways than the Apple TV 2.  The fact that it has a hard drive is a definite plus because it means there are no glitchy issues with streaming.  It still runs hot (enough so that it has damaged the cabinet it sits on) and uses more electricity than it should, plus it lacks some of the features of the new one (Netflix, ESPN) and Apple has stopped supporting it, so its not perfect but still proves to be useful.  If you can get a good deal on one it is worth getting.

$review_text.: I bought these to use while running or going to the gym, so sound quality wasn't my top priority. I just wanted affordable headphones that block outside noise and fit comfortably. These do a decent job, but I found that the wires tangled very easily and the fit wasn't great. Also, the plug is straight, which isn't as convenient as the L-shaped adapters on some other products.I prefer the Panasonic RPHJE120D, which are the same price, but more comfortable.

$REVIEW.: We bought our first Acer Aspire at the beginning of the year. Sometimes when you turn it on the computer will run but the screen will stay black. We have let it sit for a while to see if it would eventually start to work. That Acer contained an Intel processor.This computer with the AMD quad core does the exact same thing. Right out of the box the screen will stay black, but the computer seems to be running fine. I think we will not be buying anymore Acer computers.This black screen appears to be a BIOS issue, and it seems it is a common problem. Over the next few days I will attempt to get around to fixing these computers and we will see if it works.

$review_text.: My HDTV speakers are tin sounding with no bass to speak of and can be difficult to understand what people are saying a majority of the time. I needed an alternative and chose the Philips HSB2313A SoundBar due to price and product features. It is certainly not 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound quality but meets my expectations regarding rich stereo sound and bass affects. And most important of all, I can clearly understand what people are saying without any type of distortion in the sound levels.My connections:1- Dishnetwork. A Toslink optical cable is connected from the TV to the SoundBar. The Optical setting, from the SoundBar, controls the volume of Dishnetwork. In addition, an HDMI cable connected from Dishnetwork set-top box to the TV provides the HDTV video signal.2- Roku. An HDMI cable from Roku is connected to HDMI1 IN on the SoundBar Hub.3- LG BD Player. An HDMI cable from LG BD Player is connected to HDMI2 IN on the SoundBar Hub.To complete the Roku and LG BD Player connections. An HDMI cable is connected to the HDMI OUT from the SoundBar Hub to the TV's Audio Return Channel equipped HDMI port. The HDMI setting, from the SoundBar by selecting either HDMI1 or HDMI2, controls the volume of Roku or LG BD Player. Note that the Philips SoundBar HDMI Hub passes both the audio and video signals. Turn off the HDTV speakers and enjoy the sound that this SoundBar provides.

$REVIEW.: Ok i'll start by saying this I will give the cable 5 stars for the simple fact this isn't any issue with the cable , but in fact more of an issue with Onsale. they never inform you that this item is to be backordered, which I found out after 3 days and I noticed that my other 2 items that I ordered at the same time had shipped and this one did not, so I contacted Onsale and after over 3 hours they finally send me an e-mail saying it was backordered, so I try and cancel the item and get no response back! So I checked out the Onsale store and low and behold they are affiliated with Macmall who is notorious for taking peoples money on backordered items and not letting them know, so buyers beware I would recommend staying away from this seller. So now instead of hooking up my network I will have to wait maybe another 3-4 days for the new cable I ordered to get here, which is very unacceptable and very bad buisness practice.And by the way amazon is in the process of resolving this,but I figured I would let the everyone  know the facts about this seller, it isn't the money which is chump change its more the fact that I now have to wait even longer for my product.

$REVIEW.: At first I liked the router. It was easy to set up and there were lots of options. However the router quickly proved to be unreliable. The router would not pass traffic via wired or wireless connection. After a power off/power on it would start working again. We needed to do this about 3-4 times a day.The unit gets hot, and we cut the resets down to about 1-2 times per day by putting a fan on it. Given the number of positive reviews I'm guessing we got a bad unit.

$review_text.: These are nice cameras but they have a serious (fatal) problem with the shutter button.  The button falls apart which renders the camera useless.  This has happened twice with the camera I own.  The first time it occurred under warranty and Sony fixed the problem although it occurred on vacation in France which was a bummer.  Now the exact same problem has reoccurred and Sony wants $171.00 to fix it.  I'd save my money or buy a Nikon or Canon.  If you'll notice this is not the only review that mentions this problem.

$REVIEW.: Yippee!  I finally snagged one of these on sale for less than a hundred bucks -- what an awesome buy - even for a gadget junkie like me.  First, this is one cool looking piece of gear.  Second, the sound quality is great.  Third the video quality is excellent if your expectations are reasonable.  It is also very easy to use.  I did not bother reading the manual yet, I just put in batteries and turned it on and started recording (after setting the date and walking through the menus a bit).Very pleased with the results.  The biggest drawback is that there is no zoom for the video.  Other than that, not much to complain about in my opinion.  Build quality seems very good to me for the price.  I think this is a much better value at 100 bucks than the ZOOM Q3HD at 260-280 currently.  I also have a Zoom H2 which I love.  Wonderful audio quality.  The Q3 is in the same league and the video is just icing on the cake. (The H2 is better for strictly audio recording, it's truly amazing, but the Q3 is great and adding video adds a lot of fun!)  Note that you can use the Q3 in "audio only" mode for extended recording time - a nice plus.I bought this A/C adapter (Zoom AD14 Power Supply for Q3, H4N and R16) and have plenty of rechargeable batteries at hand, so no issues there.At the current price, I can see absolutely no reason not to give yourself one of these for Christmas!  ;)
$SUMMARY.: I love it!  Awesome for under 100 dollars!

$review_text.: I happen to also own a competing product, theTrendnet Greennet 8 port Gigabit Ethernet switch, and this switch performs just about identically. Both draw 2W of power when filled with active Ethernet cables, both take the same amount of time to transfer a large file between 2 Macs. The Trendnet is a nice green plastic, and this switch is a nice painted metal. I prefer metal, and it should dissipate heat more thoroughly, so that's one advantage for the TP-Link.The one big advantage the Trendnet has is it has indicator lights on the opposite side of the switch from the cables, so I can choose to set the device up with the indicator lights facing me, while avoiding the snarled mess of cables.Otherwise, it's hard to choose between them. I just like the low energy usage. My electricity bill is high enough as it is.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this little streaming device in late June 2011. It has almost always been a fine performer with smooth WIFI streaming when using the 10 Mbps download speed that I have available at home. The remote can be a little glitchy at times, but nothing that's an insoluble problem.I also have had occasion to try out the new and supposedly improved Roku 2 XS (see my review elsewhere on Amazon) What a disappointment! Nothing but problems with the second generation device: difficulty connecting to the Internet during initial setup, drops Internet connection when streaming, hangs when streaming, interferes with WIFI-enabled TV, Blu-ray player and soundbar system.And the first generation device has none of these problems? That's very strange indeed! If you plan on purchasing a Roku box, stay with the first generation Roku XDS until Roku resolves the significant glitches present in its new technology or better yet comes out with the Roku 3.

$review_text.: I received this lens today after having ordered it on Friday afternoon; Amazon comes through again with simply great service!I purchased this lens for my Canon Rebel XT.I ordered this lens after reading all the reviews here and a few other places. This was a replacement for a Tamron 18-270mm f/3.5-6.3 Di II VC LD I received last Friday. The Tamron 18-270 sounded like exactly what I was looking for, the mechanical properties of the lens is horrible. Some had said how the lens would get tight while zooming in or out, mine didn't get tight, it flat out stuck and I didn't want to try another one.Although I am giving up 70mm on the long end I don't feel this is anything to bother me. I bought this lens in anticipation of a family trip out West and I think the 200mm will get me close enough just fine.I have walked around here today and already taken about 70 pictures with it. The clarity of the pictures is more than someone of my abilities really wants or needs. The pictures I have taken throughout the range of this lens are fantastic. The lens that stayed on this camera is a Canon 28-135 IS lens and after playing around with this I seriously doubt that lens will ever go back on the camera.The OS works very well. In taking some handheld shots around our manufacturing plant I tried close ups and some distance shots involving various items with text on them. Each time I would take two shots, one with the OS on and the other with it off. The difference between the shots is, as they say, night and day. The OS seems to work just as well as the IS on my Canon lens.There is no lens creep on this lens right now but of course it's brand new, I'm sure that over time with use it may develop some but this doesn't bother me as that is what the lens lock is for.The lens has a very good feel to it and the build quality for what I can see looks very good.This is my first Sigma lens and from what I see with this one I wouldn't hesitate to order another lens made by this company, great stuff.

$review_text.: Presentation projectors have come a long way. As a longtime user of projectors, the Epson EX5230 offers a lot for any company wanting to invest in a projection printer but also for those who tend to do webinars for their business.I.  What's Inside the Box:-  EX5230 Pro projector-  Power cable-  Computer cable (VGA)-  USB cable-  Projector remote control-  Soft carrying case-  Batteries-  User manual CD-  Quick Setup SheetII.  Setup for the LCD ProjectorIt's important to note that if you are using a screen at work or traveling to a location with a projector screen, let alone a white wall, you will want to have some elevation for the projector.For one, the zoom and side tilt is manual.  The farther back you have the projector, the bigger the size of projections, the closer you are, the smaller the projection.Because most people traveling with these will want the portability, what I have done is bring a small folding table enough to hold the projector even use a foldable smaller ladder that can support it.  [as a lot of places are not equipped to elevate or hold a projector at times]But the projector was very easy to use.On the back of the unit is the power cord, red,white, yellow input, Svideo, USB-A and USB-B, computer VGA and HDMI inputs.On top of the unit is the status for lamp, temperature, muting the sound, controlling via auto vertical correction and easy&#8211;slide horizontal image correction.I used the projector on my laptop and tested with Windows 7.I tested the projector for work projects on PowerPoint and the 3LCD, 3&#8211;chip technology and C2Fine technology giving 3500 lumens was quite evident as picture quality was very good in a dark room.I tested a webinar (Streaming) and picture quality was good, also tested out YouTube and Skype which also looked good.It's important to note that this unit is NOT wireless.  The EX5220 and the EX7220 are wireless.The unit is also not WXGA widescreen, you will need to look at the EX6220 and EX7220 models.I also tested the unit for other things such as watching programming in HD such as DVD, Blu-ray and connecting a DVR and picture quality was good.  I also connected my PS3 and XBOX 360 which also looked very good.  (Please note that I have a 7.2 receiver, which I am able to connect to the Epson)But while the picture quality for this projector is good, it's not 1080p HD and if you want the better resolution, then you will want to look at the Epson PowerLite Home Cinema projectors.As for the remote, the remote is quite simple to use and figure out.  As for the bag, it is padded, so that is a plus.JUDGMENT CALL:For a business projector, the Epson EX5230 Pro XGA 3 LCD Projector is a very good projector for its price.  But there is something VERY IMPORTANT that I have to mention.For $50 more, you can get the EX7220 Pro which is wireless and WXGA.  For those who are wondering what is the difference between XGA and WXGA:XGA (1024 x 768), WXGA (1280 x 800), HD (1920 x 1080)As the jump from XGA to HD is several hundred dollars more, the jump from XGA to WXGA is only $50.  So, in a way, you get more bang for your buck purchasing the Epson EX7220.So, while the unit is fantastic for its use.  You would expect it to be much lower than the EX7220 in price.  But it's still a solid unit as other competitors offer a similar projector in specs but lower lumens.  So, you are getting more brightness with this projector, so no worries about the XGA projectors of the past that were very dim.I also recommend if you are planning to run via a laptop with HDMI or VGA, to purchase a longer HDMI cable and VGA (12-15 ft.) depending on your needs (the unit comes with a 4 ft. VGA cable).  I recommend this for anyone wanting to purchase a work projector or for your company.  As I have been in many situations setting up where 4-8 ft. of VGA or HDMI was inadequate.So, I do recommend the Epson EX5230 Pro XGA 3 LCD Projector but if possible, for an extra $50, definitely go for the Epson EX7220 WXGA 3 LCD Projector as the wireless capability and the WXGA will be more beneficial for your business/company in the long run.
$SUMMARY.: For those looking for a non wireless, non-WXGA LCD Projector, you can't go wrong with the Epson EX5230 Pro

$review_text.: I live about 40 miles from Orlando-metro area...as the crow flies.  Consequently, I have tried to place and position all of my radios to get the best AM reception until a friend suggested a Wi-Fi internet radio.  Sure some of my radios work better than others, but BOOM...as the evening comes, forget about listening to AM radio.So let me understand this...I can hook this up to my server and receive how many stations?  10, 15, 20,000???  Static Free??OK...now the research and reading and reading of all of the Amazon reviews.  Go for it...I bought the Logitech UE Smart Radio!Set up was easy.  Hooked it up to my Wi Fi in seconds and then I immediately put my favorite stations under &#34;My Favorites&#34;.  Done!!  Now, on to some of my hometown stations in Buffalo (have to listen to the Bills games you know) and done!  They sound like I was back in the old neighborhood...MINUS the static!!  Crystal clear!!Now, I googled some other stations (call signs) like in NYC or Chicago and they too are part of &#34;My Favorites&#34;.  This unit also allows you to store 6 favorites of your &#34;My Favorites&#34; - Done!  Just like programming a car radio.  I have 6 stations that I get instantly by pressing their assigned button.The sound is decent.  Not bad.  I was more concerned with static free than audio, but the audio is pretty decent for a radio about the size of a small kid's lunch box.  Rich bass and all.  Did I say, &#34;NO AM Static??&#34;My only concern is battery use.  I do get pretty much a whole day without recharging so I shouldn't complain, but I feel you should be able to get longer battery life if the color display was not on continuously.  My idea would be to have a &#34;screen saver&#34; after a minute, so that battery life can last longer from not having the color display on all of the time.  No biggy!Buy this radio and now the world is at your finger tips!
$SUMMARY.: Should of bought this much earlier...why did I wait?  Don't you!!

$REVIEW.: I pontificated for several months before buying these, due to fluctuating prices and scare stories of fake units being sold on Amazon. I also looked at Ety ER6i's, Ultimate Ears and various Shure units, but can't stomach the cost without a test drive. I may still get one of those sets if these don't work out. I finally decided to bite the bullet on the CX300 since the sound quality on my aging Koss "The Plug" phones has reduced to nothing short of appalling.Firstly, let me say that I am sure the pair I got from Amazon do NOT seem to be fake. They are beautifully made and have the proper, slim profile right-angle plug. I have seen plenty of pictures of fakes on the 'net and these look genuine. The packaging was also top notch.I would not consider myself an audiophile, but I like to think I know what sounds like faithful reproduction and what doesn't. I'm not a bass-head and I mostly listen to 70s-80s rock and pop. I'm an electrical engineer by profession and you won't catch me spending more than $[...] on any piece of A/V cable.My first impression of sound quality was "Ooooh! Tinny!", which surprised me as the packaging promised "Bass driven sound". However, after listening to and playing with them for a few hours, I actually think they're quite good. Remember, I have been using a pair of Koss plugs for the last 3 years, and the quantity of bass on those is ludicrous.[...]Getting a good seal on the CX300s is critical for getting the full range of sound. I have quite large ear canals (probably helped by wearing the Koss plugs) and not even the largest silicone rings supplied with the Sennheisers will seal properly for me. Also, the units are very small and if worn properly (with the cable hanging down), the short length of the driver body does not allow me to push the unit all the way into my ear. I found that the best seal and sound quality can be achieved by inserting the units upside down. The bass is then indeed quite present. Still nothing like the Koss's, but those were a "wall of bass" and altogether over the top.The CX300s have much clearer and present mids and highs than the Koss, but the sounds seem a bit mangled and confused when there's a lot going on in the music. So far I have only listened to 128kbps MP3 and FM radio with them, so more experimentation with a lossless source is needed. I will probably have to re-encode all my CD collection at a higher bit-rate now that I have better earphones.I also discovered (by using the University of NSW's online equal loudness contour applet) that the CX300s have a big response spike at around 6kHz. (I've run this test with all my headphones). I have to knock the relevant EQ slider down about 5dB on my MP3 player to make them sound natural and less squawky.One thing these are excellent for is listening in bed with one ear on the pillow. Since they are so tiny, they don't get forced into my ear like the Koss.I have left them playing an FM radio source for a whole day in case this makes them sound any better (I am skeptical on this) and will report back in due course...

$REVIEW.: Stop trying to find the case that you like on Amazon because you came across the right one here.Case fits the iPad Mini Retina, is good quality and doesn't add a lot of bulk. It provides adequate protection without becoming obnoxious and helps protect your screen.The case doesn't completely protect the corners but does a much better than other cases. If truly worried about the corners, I think only the Apple Smart Cases will fully protect you. If you want a case that will make your iPad Mini look like a professional device, buy this.Don't try settling on a sub $10 case. You'll end up buying two of them before being completely satisfied.I usually buy several cases because I can't decide on a case I like. I don't have that itch with this case.

$REVIEW.: All the other reviews are valid. The Engrish instructions are terrible, the Android app doesn't work (after multiple tries) and setting the camera up can be a challenge.However, I still bought it because the cost of a stand-alone color video  baby monitor is insane. For well under $100 and only a bit of struggle, we have a baby monitor that we can view from our smartphones or iPad while on our home WiFi network. Can't view from outside the network, but that's due to the internet security we have in place. I could change it but why?It does what we want to do. It gives us a chance to watch our twin boys room so we can see what they do when we aren't in there( great entertainment). We can see if they are crying for a specific reason or just in their sleep before we get out of bed and disturb everything.The only downfall(in this kind of application) is no audio ( still have a baby monitor for sound) and that the AC power cord limits where you can put this, especially in an older house with limited outlets.So, before you spend $150+ on a video baby monitor, give this (or a similar camera) a chance.
$SUMMARY.: Makes a good baby video monitor

$REVIEW.: First, when you look at this, Amazon suggests that you buy a 9.8 ft ethernet cord with it


It comes with a 5 ft cable in the box, so measure before you order, and maybe save $6.This router is particularly useful for those of us who RV or have frequent power outages, as it works on 12 volt power

I like it whenever I am online with my laptop, no matter where I am, as I no longer have to worry about the aircard getting bumped and wrecking the (horribly expensive to repair) laptop USB receptacle.Be aware that if you buy from Cradlepoint, their tech support only works day shift mon-fri, so don't plan on having setup glitches outside those hours

I have shopped extensively for speakers.  I don't like the lack of mids in the Bose soundlink speakers.This was my second purchase of these speakers because I greatly mistreated the last one and it eventually broke...lots of beach use, rain, dropping on bike trips.

I wrapped mine with electrical tape in some places, and also used the wire loom in the engine bay for extra protection. Nice gold plated crimp terminals, real nice rca wires, and thick speaker wire. Fuse was a bit small for me, so I picked up a 150amp fuse from the auto parts store. Overall, best buy for your cash and more conductors then insulation!!

$review_text.: I got this 25 foot cable to connect my laptop to my flat screen TV

I needed the extra length so that I could run it around the edge of the room from the TV to the end table next to my easy chair where I sit when I watch TV
The length is just about right and both picture quality and sound quality are great

I watched a full length film with no flicker anywhere along the way

One thing to be aware of, the cable is quite thick and is a bit heavy and a little stiff

That can make it a little difficult to get it to completely unroll and lie straight


I suppose it's because of shielding necessary to support the extended length and the newer standards.I also have a shorter, thinner, 6 foot cable which I can use to drive the TV from a laptop on the floor in front of it
I like that this longer cable lets me control everything from my comfortable chair across the room with no loss in sound or image quality.

$review_text.: OK, I just received the Slimblade. I have used Kensington ExpertMouse trackballs for about 16 years now, started using them because we needed a mouse that doesn't move when working on ships, but got so used to it and also started needing it for ergonomic considerations.I recently had to convert to Windoze 7 and opted to run the 64-bit version for more memory. Needless to say that the old Kensington ExpertMouse driver stopped working. I found out about Kensington's beta program for the new driver, called "Trackballworks" and decided to test the Slimblade with it, which I wanted for some time, but didn't buy earlier due to its limited programmability and many negative reviews on this issue.The Slimblade is the coolest looking trackball ever and is ergonomically far superior to the latest ExpterMouse, which is way too steep. Slimblade is even better (because flatter) than my old ExpertMouse, which I have to retire, because it is not supported (yet) by the new driver. The ball is slightly smaller than my old ExpertMouse ball, but identical in size to the latest ExpertMouse. Bright red to contrast the charcoal gray housing. That funny little flag sticking out the left side is actually rubber, you can cut it off with a knife.This is an optical mouse, the ball is textured under its smooth surface (looks like a car's "metallic" coating) and two optical units pick up the movement of the ball, which is seated on three tiny little ball bearings (individual metal balls in a seat). Looks like cleaning will not be an issue at all, the bearing balls are too small to pick up dirt and the optical sensors are recessed behind a large opening. The bottom under the ball is open, letting larger dirt fall out. Slick solution!What works out of the box on 64-bit Windoze 7 are the left and right mouse buttons as well as - to my surprise - the scroll function with the ball, which either scrolls up and down in all applications (not just browsers) or, if the vertical is all contained within the window, it scrolls horizontally (e.g. my Explorer windows, which I keep wide).What does not work are buttons 3 and 4 (no function at all, as far as I can tell) and neither does the snap-to-default-button function of the standard mouse control panel.Installing the Kensington beta 0.07 driver gives you more functionality, but, unfortunately, still not the same as the ExpertMouse. Having the trackball plugged in during driver installation immediately shows any added device and the driver allows you to select which settings you want to adjust with a click on one of four icons at the bottom (supported devices are only those that are currently sold: Slimblade, ExpertMouse and two others). Supported operating systems are Windows XP, Vista, 7 (32 and 64-bit) and Mac.With the driver installed, I can configure all four buttons independently. See custom images at the top. Unfortunately, the chording of buttons 1/2 and 3/4 is not available (options are grayed out) on the Slimblade, only on the ExpertMouse.Pointer speed and acceleration are standard fare (albeit without the slick visual curves) as we are used to it on older drivers. The scrolling on the Slimblade needs some getting used to it (I used to twist the ball on my old ExpertMouse as a nervous habit and now engage the scrolling without wanting to) but it is nice, because your fingers don't have to leave their positions - you use the ball to do it. Setting the scroll speed to its highest level enables you to scroll two web pages with little movement and without resetting your fingers.I agree with others who stated that the click is a little hollow and too loud for my taste. The case is made of plastic, feels a little thin, but certainly adds to the looks. Only time will tell how sturdy it is and if it is as flimsy as others describe it.One minor gripe is that the USB cord could be a little longer (it looks to be just under 5 ft), it barely reaches my computer, which is under the desk and to the left of my keyboard (Slimblade on the right). ExpertMouse cords are longer.All in all a very nice product, ergonomically the best I've seen and used and I believe I will keep it, I really like it. The new driver is very encouraging and perhaps Kensington will decide to give us button chording as well as support for older trackballs after release. The driver is fairly stable and has few minor issues.
$SUMMARY.: Very slick device!

$review_text.: I have been a PC guy for most of my computing life and recently switched to a Mac. I bought the Classic when it became available and am amazed at its ease of use, user friendly interface, capacity and most of all the quality of the sound that it plays. I am very picky about my music and until I bought the Classic I thought my Zen was a good player. This player puts the Zen to shame! It works seamlessly with Itunes and is all in all a great player. The only thing that I can negatively say about it is that when switching between playlists/songs etc there is a lag of a few seconds that takes a bit of getting used to but I guess thats the difference between flash memory and a hard drive. Other than that little quibble, the Classic is the way to go if you have a pretty good sized music collection. Set up was a snap and there were no issues with the OS. Another winner from Apple!

$REVIEW.: I must say that Apple has turned me into a fan since they moved to Intel processors a few years ago -- they run Windows great for the part.For this purchase I was replacing an older 30" Dell monitor and didn't want to lose my screen resolution -- but also didn't want to pay another 2k for a new 30" monitor. This iMac was a great choice, I'm basically using it for it's screen and for when I need to test things on OSX. Purely as screen alone this thing is great, the IPS technology is very impressive and the response time seems to be very good even though it's going through a DVI-to-Mini Display Port adapter at full 2560x1440 resolution. HINT -- You change the input source only if the Mac is on and then you hit Command and F2. More on leaving the Mac running in a moment.For the PC side of this Mac (and stop kidding yourself, it's a PC just running OSX) you get pretty good performance. I'm using a Core i7 based system with 12GB of Ram and SSD's in a raid so I'm very spoiled as far as performance goes, but still this iMac holds it's own fairly well. What I'm extremely impressed with is how quiet and cool this thing runs. I can not tell when it's own -- while my full on PC is fantastically fast it sounds like a fan is running all the time trying to keep it cool, this iMac is amazingly quiet and cool. So while I mainly use this as just a monitor it actually runs cooler and uses less energy than my old 30" monitor even though it's a full PC that is running.Finally the mouse and keyboard for this are excellent -- as long as you don't plan on using them for very long. I'm not sure why Apple gives you just a keyboard with no keypad on it for what is supposed to be a daily use computer. While it looks nice and makes the monitor look really big it also makes it difficult to use at times. However if you can get past that the keyboard is excellent. The mouse is fairly good as well, I got used to using the top gestures fairly quickly and its a neat treat. However it's much to flat to be comfortable to use for extended periods. Since the mouse doesn't support your hand like a normal mouse you end up holding your hand out when using it -- while this doesn't sound like a big deal it can become a pain to do after 30-40 mins of solid usage.Finally Pt2 -- This really is an excellent PC, Windows 7 runs great on it. Another hint, when you go to upgrade the video drivers get the mobility drivers, not the standard ones -- it took me 2 tries to figure out why they were not loading. The PC performance is great and it runs games at full resolution surprising well.That's it -- overall I have to say I'm very happy with this purchase.

$REVIEW.: This card worked right out the of the box, it installed easily and i haven't had any problems with it. The only thing that stopped me from giving it a 5 star rating is the fact that the 5v plug that is required is rather hard to plug in. Maybe it was just mine but in the time that i've had this card i've had two power supplies so i don't think it was the power supply. It was just hard to push in and take out, i was afraid it was going to break. But once it was in i didn't have to worry about it anymore. Other than that, it is a great card and well worth the price!
$SUMMARY.: Great USB 3.0 card for the price

$review_text.: My girlfriend and I use this on all of our devices. You simply turn it on, go to bluetooth settings in your phone and click on it, then it tells you to type a number on the keyboard and it works every time. We have had this for a while and never changed the batteries. They last for a long time. It works great and I can type fast on it. It is durable and sits on the couch and gets sat on all the time. It just works and works well. Dont spend more on a name brand. Amazon Basics is always a very nice OEM looking product, made of quality components.

$review_text.: I really like these Bose speakers. I use them for my home theater as well as for listening to music, and the sound coming out of them is rich, warm, clean, and loud, especially considering their small size. I'm powering them with a Sony STR-DH100 receiver which I bought for $130 on Amazon, and I believe this is a good pairing. At the current price, these are also excellent value, which is a odd thing to be saying about a Bose product, as they are generally known for being over priced.There are only two caveats to mention. First, the cube speakers sound very directional, so you really need to be in front of them to get the full effect.  Secondly, while this system produces a very warm sound, it doesn't do a great job with deep base because the sub-woofer is just too small to hit those lows, and on top of that, it doesn't have its own amp. What this means practically, is that playing songs by the Beatles, or Green Day is going to sound great...but playing something from Bone Thugs in Harmony will sound a bit muted.One more thing to say. I've had the small cube speakers by my TV for a few years, with the sub-woofer in a corner nearby. My fiance, who's lived with me the whole time, recently found the box (the sub-woofer) sitting in the corner and said, "what's this box doing here, can we throw it out, or move it to a closet?". Funny, but I guess it speaks to the small profile that the system has in your home. She just assumed it was only the two small cube speakers.

$REVIEW.: As a travel writer I spend a lot of time at Walt Disney World, and Canon PowerShot Digital Elphs are the most common cameras I see. Families seem to love them, because they're so easy to carry and operate. About the size of a deck of playing cards, each of these "pocket cameras" really do slip right into a pants pocket, and their rectangular designs make them easy to grip. Best of all, they all take good photos. (How do I know? Because I've actually gotten to use every one of these models. Nearly every day guests ask me to take photos of them with their own cameras, which most often are Canon PowerShot Digital Elphs.)Here's my breakdown of the ten bestselling Digital Elph models. Any of the first six are superb choices:1ST PLACE:SD1100 ISAn update to the SD1000 (see below), this 2008 8MP beauty adds image stabilization, a slightly longer zoom (38-114 mm), another MP of photo size and a small indent on the right side for a better grip. Plus it comes in colors! My daughter has a blue one and uses it every single day. During school days the image stabilization made a real difference in her on-the-bus shots. With that heavy of use hers has gotten scratched up a bit, but the marks are small and hardly noticeable.2ND PLACE:SD870 ISThe ELPH to buy if you want a wide-angle lens. Slightly thicker than the SD1100 IS, this 8MP model doesn't have an optical viewfinder which makes it tough to use in bright sunlight, otherwise there's little not to love. My husband uses one as a comp camera, to compose shots for the travel guide "The Complete Guide to Walt Disney World."3RD PLACE:SD770 ISJust released in May, this 10 MP model is, in a way, an update of the SD1100 IS (see above). I rate it lower because it costs about $50 more and doesn't come in colors. On the other hand, it has a longer battery life than the 1100 and features an improved LCD screen that is very easy to view. As for photo quality, I can't tell the difference.4TH PLACE:SD950 ISThere's a lot to like in this 12.1 MP camera. First off, it's gorgeous. The body, though a little thick, is titanium. An upgrade to the SD850 IS (see below), it has a 3.7x zoom lens and adds manual controls as well as the ability to stitch together panoramic images. The only reason I don't rate it higher is the price.5TH PLACE:SD890 IS(The camera on this page)Want a long zoom lens? Here's your baby, a 2008 10 MP model with a 5x zoom. Also has the new bright LCD screen and all the other 2008 Canon goodies. The most expensive Canon PowerShot ELPH.6TH PLACE:SD790 ISWith the same 10 MP image sensor and 3x zoom lens as the SD770 IS, this 2008 model stands out only for its larger 3-inch LCD display and, as a result, lack of optical viewfinder. The rear controls are different, too, with a flatter design that uses fewer buttons.7TH PLACE:SD1000In my opinion there's no reason to buy this 7.1 MP model. Released in 2007, it's been replaced by the SD1100 IS (see above). The SD1000 is a fine camera but it doesn't have image stabilization, a key feature of the 2008 lineup.8TH PLACE:SD850 ISThe ancestor to the SD890 IS, this 8 MP Elph combines a 4x zoom and 8 MP photo size with an image stabilizer. Every button, dial and switch has a quality feel. Slighter larger than the other models here, it is a little tougher to pop in and out of your pocket, but if you have larger hands it may be just what you are looking for.9TH PLACE:SD800 ISThis 7.1 MP predecessor to the 870 doesn't focus well at its edges when set at its widest angle. Unless it's priced really cheap, get the 870 instead.10TH PLACE:SD750The 2007 PowerShot flagship offers a light meter that adjusts for facial brightness, 17 shooting modes, some first-rate movie features and red-eye correction -- features that were innovative a year ago but are common in Canon's latest models. No image stabilization; no optical viewfinder. Choose a 2008 model instead.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this headset to use with my Samsung Galaxy S and I have had no drop out issues. I only use this for music and audio books on my motorcycle (with loud pipes and a skull cap), but it does just fine. The sound quality is decent, but there are better units out there, depending on your needs. I also have a Motorola Backbeat, which has great sound and performance if you have a small to medium size head/neck, but is terrible if you have a large or XL large head/neck. This unit is extremely versatile in size range and does not interfere with the fit of my helmet; I would give it a 10 in that category. The controls are very easy to learn and I can even use them with little effort with my motorcycle gloves on. One thing I really appreciate is that I have no trouble turning my head to look behind me before lane changes. The battery outlasts my phone many times over, so I am very pleased with that. The only issue I have is that the sound quality/volume could be better, but it isn't bad. Keep in mind, this is with loud pipes at highway speed, wind noise included. Overall, I would recommend this unit for a biker.
$review_summary.: No connectivity issues with a Samsung Galaxy S. Best I've found for bikers.

$review_text.: I just purchased this Nikon as a pocket camera, and it's GREAT for that purpose. I don't expect it to replace my Nikon D90 or My D3100, so I can accept it's limitations, but this is an amazing pocket camera that will take perfect pictures straight out of the box in minutes, if used correctly-(which is super easy). This camera cannot be beat for the money-the technology is awesome and the Nikon quality is there. So if you're looking for a great SMALL pocket camera that will take perfect pictures, the L22 is a great choice.The price is fantastic, so I purchased the oops protection plan in case I fumbled and dropped it-(it's pretty tiny for large hands).

The ipod works great, except that they didn't supply a plate/slot that fits the latest nano.  The CD player is really erratic -- one tiny scratch and it stops playing. It sounds pretty good for a plastic stereo that only cost $60.  I don't expect it to last, but I really didn't have the cash for something better right now, so it serves it's purpose.

$REVIEW.: Seriously...these are the first buds I've ever been able to fit inside my ears - they stay put and don't fall out!  Very comfortable to wear, the foam padding helps drown out exterior noise so you can concentrate on the exceptional sound quality these ear buds produce.  The cable from the 1/8" connector to the "Y" measures 36", while the rest of the cable to each ear measures 16" long. There is a tiny "clothespin" to keep it attached to your clothing.  I'm using this with an LG840G Tracfone, it works great.  Sound quality is excellent, the bass is deep, rich and not muddy, the treble is crisp and clean. Listening to music through these ear buds I'm hearing notes I never have heard prior to this on my expensive home stereo. In addition to a zippered storage case, there are extra ear tips in various sizes to fit most any size ear.

The CD that comes in the box will probably have Sapphire's own versions...but since March you can also use the generic Catalyst drivers from AMD/ATI, which is great, as Sapphire wasn't very good at keeping them up-to-date. Download them before installing this card and you'll be good to go.For those of you who might wonder if better hardware can elevate a mediocre gamer to something better...in a word - yes.  I have yet to find a game where I can't play better by an order of magnitude than I could with my 8800GT.Important thing to know - this is one very long card - just shy of 11.5".  I have an Antec 900 case which holds it - but I bought a larger case than I really wanted just so that there would be room for this card.The price is a little lower than the cost of two separate 4850s, especially when you consider that this is a 2GB card - 1GB for each GPU. Crossfire requires Vista or Windows 7 to work correctly, btw... MacOS X isn't supported by this product.

$REVIEW.: I first got the opportunity to really put this camcorder to good use at my two-year-old daughter's first ballet recital.  In a reasonably crowded auditorium, I was able to get seats maybe 15 rows back from the stage.  Without standing behind a tripod, I wouldn't have believed that I would be able to get watchable footage from that distance, but the optical stabilization in this camcorder is astonishing!  You'll likely think there's something wrong with the camcorder when you pick it up -- the internal optical train is floating, loose, inside the body of the camcorder.  This floating feature is what allows you to steadily zoom in on a distant object without translating the shaking of your hands into unbearable shaking of the video.  At the end of the day, we got really wonderful footage, zoomed in tight, of my daughter "dancing" (read: standing still and waving her prop flower at us while music played).The projection feature is certainly neat, but a little gimmicky for my taste.  I can't see a time when this would be the preferred way in which I would showcase the video I've shot.  For reviewing the footage I've just taken, I wouldn't rely on projecting it on a wall, either, lest I think that the focus problems that I might have from the projector were somehow the fault of the video I'd just taken.  Still, it's got a nice wow factor, and I suppose I might find a way to show it off.The lens hood attaches in a quirky fashion, and blocks the 5-channel directional microphone's most important channel (forward).  Not sure I'd recommend using it.The video quality is very good - so good, that iMovie can't import it directly (1080p at 60 frames per second is beyond iMovie's native capabilities).  If you have a mac, I found a work-around: open the drive with the AVCHD file, open that in Quicktime player, and select the clip you want to import.  "File" -> "Save" that clip once it's playing to your desktop, and iMovie can open that file from the Desktop.

$REVIEW.: Decent walkie-talkies, but pricey

 I have bought a pair of these a couple of years ago and they worked well on a 3K mile road trip throughout the West
 They were especially useful when we were in remote areas of our National Park system.As with most walkie-talkies of this sort, you're only transmitting at .5 watt of power, so there's no way you'll get nearly the distance as printed unless you're elevated (like on a mountain) to avoid the curvature of the earth and a clean line of sight


 If you can understand this concept you'll understand that getting 1-2 miles (on the open road) on these is actually pretty good


 You will have to take into context that the level of these units are fairly low quality, so 4-Stars is based on comparing to &#34;other&#34; brands I've used
 If I didn't compare/rate this product in this manner, it would received a 1-star rating


 But in order to get a higher rating, you need to move up to a 1+ watt unit that requires a license to use


So understand this review is like rating Yugo's to Yugo's and rather than Ferrari's to Lamborghini.The build is decent, but lacks weather protection

 I wouldn't trust these things in light rain

 The primary send button is tiny (like pushing the top of an eraser head), which is placed under a 1.5 inch rubber cover, so missing the button which is in the middle is common


 This is probably the most annoying part of the radio


 Also, this rubber piece starts deteriorating under heavy use

 The sound quality is good, much better than what I've experienced with other brands (Motorola, Midland)

 This does lack a battery tray, so you have to use their proprietary battery


 Buying spares is relatively cheap and last much longer than double or triple A's


 I like the NOAA frequencies and the different privacy options


 I've used them in Disneyland and they worked well w/o anyone on our random frequency.Overall, I was willing to pay $20 more for these for the quality of sound and distance


 I've been able to reach a couple miles on a twisty roads and as much as 3 miles on a rolling straight highway
 Of course, these are rare, so expect the 1-2 miles on the highway and a mile or less in metropolitan areas

 In heavily wooded areas, expect well under a mile, but most of the time you won't be separated from your group by that much.


 The build isn't great, but at the end of the day it's the sound quality and distance I need


 The NOAA feature is nice, so in a crunch, I have two extra weather band radios while I'm camping, in the car, or during severe weather at home.

$REVIEW.: It delivers great sound quality and it looks like a $100 headphone. I really love the sound. However, it is too small. You'll be surprised if you only look at the picture and buy it. You need to extend the arms, unless you're a kid, and the bad thing is it's really hard to extend it. Probably because it is small, it's tighter and not really comfortable compared to other headphones. I don't like listening to it for elongated period. I think it's  better for women with small head.

$review_text.: Often a buyer isn't always 100% sure a computer part will work, but it did. Easy to install and worked fine in my older computer. Shortly afterward the PC, which had been having other problems, died, and cracking the case on a brand new one invalidates the warranty so I haven't switched the card yet. I will add more to this review when I do install it in the new one.
$SUMMARY.: Does the job for a good price

$REVIEW.: This is my first HD television.  I know, it's about time!  Well, I didn't want to spend $5,000 for a TV set.  A friend told us about this set at Sam's Club that was on sale for less than $900.  We compared it to other brands and were amazed at the clarity and sharpness.  Side by side with other sets, LCD and plasma, the picture on this Vizio set was in the top of the pack.When we got it home, we couldn't wait to see it in action in our living room.  After unpacking our new HD DVD player and a new HD DVD disc, we were finally able to see it under actual home viewing conditions.  The first thing that we noticed was that the new TV, out of the box, needed color, contrast, brightness, and tint adjustments.  So, for about 30 minutes we tweaked, adjusted, and scrutinized the adjustments until they were almost perfect.Although my wife and I are in our early 50s and our eyesight isn't as great as it once was, I found the optimum viewing distance to be closer than I had thought; about 12 feet works better than 16 feet.  This makes the set ideal for most bedrooms and living rooms.One of the more impressive technical features is the myriad of input connections that are available on the set, including two HDMI inputs.  You can even use it as a computer monitor!I am sure that there are bigger and better sets out there, but for the price it is a fantastic value ($897).  We saved enough to buy the HD DVD player, some HD Video discs, and upgrade our DirecTv system to HD.
$review_summary.: Excellent set for the money!

$REVIEW.: Don't hassle with opening your computer case to connect an Serial ATA (SATA)/IDE device to your computer. This USB to SATA IDE cable includes an external power supply adapter, allowing you to connect and power any SATA/IDE device quickly and painlessly. Because there is no extra enclosure, you can connect any 2.5&#34;, 3.5&#34; drive through the usb to sata cable. The included AC power supply lets you use even the most power-demanding devices. The cable is fully plug and play compatible and permits for hot swapping of devices.

DOCSIS 3.0 compliant which is a plus! Measured my speed (via two online speed test sites) after the upgrading to this new modem and was pleasantly surprised. Used with an exisiting wireless network. Just plugged it into the router after the modem completed booting and refreshed and everything was working as it should. Couldn't have been easier and I couldn't be happier!

$REVIEW.: I bought this adapter and returned it four days later. Initially it worked well (as it should have, since the access point was only on the other side of the wall). But the adapter would disconnect from the network at random, sometimes after a few hours, other times after a few minutes. Each time it disconnected, the only way to reconnect was to uninstall the software and hardware, and then reinstall them again. On the rare occasion the adapter did work, the software would forget its WEP settings after a reboot, and the key would have to be manually re-entered (so many times that I have it memorized now). This adapter failed so many times that I had to reinstall it everytime I sat down to use my computer.Belkin's website support for this device is a joke. It lists three versions of the device, but doesn't tell you how to distinguish between the one you have and the other two. This leads to trying all three drivers, none of which will fix any of the problems with this horrible piece of hardware.If my only options were using this adapter and running cable down my hallway, I'd be breaking out the wire crimpers. The D-Link WUA-1340, with which I replaced the Belkin, costs the same amount of cash and works much better so far.Bottom line: Do not buy the Belkin F5D7050. It'll just leave you with spotty operation and quite a bit of wasted time.

$REVIEW.: If you want to play Nintendo exclusives, this is the latest and greatest. This is for those who want Mario, Luigi, Zelda and the whole gang in their (kids) lives. You're not going to find those characters, story lines and cute/harmless humor anywhere else. I bought this for my kids (elsewhere cheaper this time) for this reason and was pleased that I could still play these games just like it was 1990--same mechanics and similar gameplay, just much prettier. It's pretty unfair to compare this system to the others, PS4/XB1. However, if you have a limited budget for entertainment and games, that's precisely what you might be debating--particularly if it's for your kids.  It's possible this might not be the machine for you. People who get this will likely already own iPads and other tablet devices for some light gaming and perhaps a console like a PS4 or XB1. There's definitely more bang for your buck in other systems, platforms, devices than a Wii U.The big drawback to those other choices like the PS4, is that there's too much mature content on those systems--both in terms of the online connections to adults, the baked-in Ustream and Twitch streams, and also the actual games themselves. So that's a real opportunity for Nintendo. My big problem with our Wii U is the following:Cons:32GB is insanely small for today's standards!!! And access to that memory feels really sluggish...lots of waiting and spinning things. And there are all these cool games on the Nintendo eShop that you can buy and download to your system. But you probably won't be downloading too many cool open world games like Lego City Undercover or Lego Marvel Superheroes because they'll pretty much take up all the space. It's like Nintendo decided to make the shopping basket so tiny you can't put any merchandise in it!  For those games, you'll have to buy the disc and insert it every time you want to play which is decidedly last-gen to me.The game pad is a little insane to be honest. The setup took a long time. Nintendo had or has really big ambitions for the Wii U, like being the centerpiece of your entertainment system, selling and renting content like the other consoles or Apple or Fire TV. But it doesn't want to play with my cable box from TWC (Motorola). It's difficult to find what you're looking for on eShop. The overall UI is tedious, especially if you are used to an iPad or a traditional game controller. I think I saw pics of people using the Wii U with a stylus, but I had no idea they had one slotted into the back of the Wii U controller itself until I turned it upside-down. Honestly it brought back images of Palm Pilots and the late 90s. Not a bad experience with sketchbook-type games of which we've found a few to download. But honestly, it seems really peculiar to me. There are constant moments where I expect the game pad to act like a touchscreen and it wants me to use the controls or vice versa. It can be oddly un-intuitive.The gamepad is iPad mini sized but it's not an iPad. It's not autonomous, it's just a controller sending and receiving from the console. So although it's cool to keep playing games when the TV is in use by someone else, you can't take the game pad too far (15' and a wall)  from the console or it won't work. I find the placement of the buttons and sticks to be sort of weird for certain games causing the player to hold the pad in an awkward way.There's no included remote controller despite it being required for an awful lot of games. I'm going to have to get one of those now. That's fine, but I think they should include it because of how necessary it is to so much of the experience.Pros:Nintendo games! Mario, Lugigi, Zelda and more! The new titles announced at Nintendo's 2014 E3 look awesome! Can't wait for them!!!You don't have to worry about your kindergardeners jacking rides and blowing away hookers on a Wii U! You don't need to worry about your kids learning how to roll blunts from people on PS4 broadcasts on a Wii U! Good clean fun! Yea!!

$review_text.: I was very excited to try this out SSHD. I just liked the whole concept of getting access speeds with large amount of storage at a low price.But, when I installed the drive in my laptop and tried installing an operating system (Windows 8.1) on it, during the installation it was making weird clicking noises constantly. It was not something that someone would hear from any other drive. I went ahead with the installation and tried running the OS. The clicking sounds just didn't stop, as long as the HDD was running. Then I realized that the drive was faulty. I sent it back to Amazon.I was contemplating on giving a 1 star review, but the only thing that made me give this 2 stars is the fact that I like this concept of Hybrid drives very much, Maybe it was just my bad luck that I received a bad drive or maybe it's because that this technology is still in a nascent stage. Either ways, my review stands. These guys are supposed to be testing HDD's before they send them out of the factory.Still, again, the concept of SSHD's is really interesting and maybe one day I will try them out again, I heard that they are gonna come up with larger SSD storage in the future SSHD's. Maybe like 32GB instead of the present 8GB. Until then, I'm just gonna make do with a normal HDD with 7200 rpm.

$REVIEW.: First of all, some perspective: I've spent 10k on high quality audio components before. They were all for my car, however, but I say that to say this: It's pointless to compare this sytem with anything that will cost you more than $400.Now, as far as home audio, it's only recently become a focus of mine. Up until this point, I made do with a Philips system from 2005 that had really small, tinny-sounding satellites and a very small sub that distorted quite easily and could not handle low frequencies very well. Once we began upgrading our TV's to HD panels, the need for an upgrade in our receiver and speakers became painfully obvious.Enter the Onkyo HT-S5400. Initially, I got a factory-certified refurbished unit. However, the HDMI started going bad and I lost ARC and RHiD functionality. Fortunately, I was able to get my hands on a new unit directly from Amazon in February of this year and it has functioned perfectly from day 1.It's a big upgrade over the small cheap 5.1 system I had before. The first thing I noticed was the solid feel to the speakers. My former speakers were housed in cheap composite enclosures that were very small. The Onkyo's front and center channel speakers are large and have a nice, heavy feel to them. I also appreciated that the front speakers had larger enclosures and bigger 5 1/4" drivers, which can handle all the way down to 55hz. Some cheap HTiB's give you the same speakers all the way around and just label them differently. On the Philips, the center channel was just the same small 3" driver that was in all the other speakers, it just had a side-laying box.The satellites on this unit are also large. I also like the solid, real wood black finish (although take note it is just your standard pressboard underneath).The Onkyo center channel is a true center channel, with 2 drivers and a tweeter.For the bass, you have the 10", downfiring, self-powered sub that comes in a large wood enclosure with a large port on the face along with a light that shows red when in standby and blue when in use.The receiver is also a pleasant surprise, with good weight to it and a solid feel.The best thing about this sytem is that it sounds as good as it looks!For the price point, the audio is excellent. Good highs, and midrange. The larger front drivers and bigger enclosures allow for the midbass to actually come through and integrate nicely into the soundstage.The 10" self-powered sub sounds very good. The bass is deep and strong, not too boomy or punchy. It takes quite a bit of power to make it start to clip. For movie watching and music, it's perfect. I can watch a Blu Ray late at night with the volume low and I can still get very good sound, or I can crank it up and listen to it through the patio doors on the porch.The receiver handles 1080p, ARC, and 3D passthrough perfectly with no handshake issues. It integrates very nicely with our Panasonic ST30 panel. This unit also has enough listening modes and audio codec choices to keep us audiophiles busy.We have a large living room with high ceilings and an open kitchen and this sytem is more than loud enough for the listening area.All in all, you can't beat the price/performance ratio of this system. For less than four hundered bucks you get a complete, quality 7.1 speaker, 1080P 3D pass-through Home Theater system that can handle pretty much anything you throw at it.I would recommend this system to anyone in the market for a budget, start-up home theater system.

Remote is not as sensitive or too sensitive (Both apply). Now it will go to wrong station orit will change stations when I lay it down.Some folks mentioned poor customer service. I did not experience bad service until Logitech moved tech support offshore. Now I wont even call tech.

$review_text.: These are in a class by themselves. All of the usual labeling about highs, lows, mids, blah blah blah..... is unimportant here. I've come to think there is no perfect headphone, except to the listener who is immensely pleased with the sound experience. The HE500 conveys a sound experience like no other cans I've had. I'm totally pleased beyond my wildest expectations. I do have an expensive system though and that may be why they sound so good to me. Being driven by a low-end headphone amp may not yield the results I experience. I will never sell these. In fact, I will request that they be put in my casket when I die so I can take them with me to the afterlife. Do you think I like them? :-) One last thing; be sure and give them at least the 150 hours of burn-in time suggested in the owner manual. Before that, they sounded rather average to me. Some have said they keep improving up to 500 hours of use. Hard to imagine but is fine with me.Update 4.28.14I've had these for nearly two months now. I'm still "Wowed" by them, truly. I recently purchased a pure cryo'd silver cable from Revelation Audio Labs. The cable is not listed on their site but email them to order. They've been making them for years. Bottom line, Wow!!! I thought the cans sounded good before. The RAL silver cable is astounding. I'm having trouble finding words at this point. The pure silver cable takes the HE500 to the next level or two. FYI: The original cable is only silver coated copper. I was told that it's only about 1% silver. Copper really cannot compete with cryo'd silver in the high-end audio arena. So if you want to make the HE500 sound like you spent another $1000 for them, visit RAL and buy their cable. You won't be disappointed. The only problem I have now with my audio is that I want to listen all the time but can't. I still have to work and do other stuff. Darn! :-)Update 7.4.14Purchased a pair of Telefunken 6922 tubes for the headphone amp. They are cryo'd and the detail and overall sound are without competition. But I did find the that silver cable now sounded too bright and unpleasant, so I retired the silver cable. I guess I should say that if you have an already bright system, the silver cable may not be the way to go.

$REVIEW.: This surge protector is really thin and flat with a long cord.  This low prpfile makes it easy to fit behind an entertainment center.  The plugs take cords, what else does it need to do?  The only downside is that you essentially block 3 of the wall-wart plugs if you have it against a wall.  A little planning will let you use those with plugs that extend sideways if necessary.

$REVIEW.: I bought 2 14 feet cables back in April. They appeared to work fine fine until this past weekend. I disconnected them to install a new desktop, monitor mounts and clean up the cables to my computers.  When I reconnected them after about 5 or 6 hours, neither worked. Thought it was a fluke. Impossible that both should die at the very same time and for no reason.  Tried different ports on the router. Different computers. Nada. BOTH of them.

$review_text.: I was just hoping to get fewer disconnects than with my comcast supplied cable modem. I was very impressed when it was finally activated (chat + call to Comcast) and I got a "bonded" downstream connection. It also has a gigabit connection to your pc or lan which is nice but still over kill unless you can max this thing out at 160Mbps. I didn't max mine out but I did double my download speed and reduce my ping by 1ms.I visited speedtest dot net before and after I changed to this SB6121 modem.Results:Original Comcast Supplied Ambit U10C018 Cable Modem (Docsis 2.0)Avg Ping - 7msAvg Download 10.42MbpsAvg Upload 3.62MbpsNEW Motorola SB6121 Cable Modem (Docsis 3.0)Avg Ping - 6ms (-1ms)Avg Download 20.62Mbps (+10.20Mbps)Avg Upload 3.62Mbps (+0.10Mbps)Plus I can return the "rented" Ambit modem and hopefully shave off a few bucks from my monthly bill.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this system because we own two Zunes and I wanted to add a docking system in our living room.  After reading the reviews I decided that while I wasn't looking for a system that included a dual clock radio the reviews were so good I decided to make the purchase.  I love this system.  The sound is as good as any I have ever heard, it fits nicely on a shelf and the clock is a nice addition to our sitting area.It was a little challenging to get started because I never read the instructions first and haven't owned this type of product before.  I was able to figure it out and in a couple of minutes we were up and running.  I definately would recommend this system for anyone who is looking for a compact system with excellent sound.  The buttons are easy to use, the screen has adjustable brightness I can't think of any negatives about this system.It looks and sounds exactly as I expected.

$REVIEW.: I purchased these from Amazon a couple months back and I must admit that they are awesome. At the time I was planning to buy a portable jukebox (Nomad Jukebox 2), and was familiar with the concept of packaged headphones. Packaged headphones let you listen to music, they don't let you experience it. So after purchasing the jukebox, these headphones arrived shortly after.When I tried them for the first time I immediately noticed the nice clean sound coming from these headphones. I love Rap, R&amp;B, Alternate, Metal, etc. I definately love bass. These headphones definately deliver on the bass. Throw in an equalizer and you'll be in bass heaven. With regards to a comfortable fit, that varies from user to user. At first they weren't very comfortable, but after continued usage they began to fell like a part of my head. lol.When I'm on campus, everyone that I let listen to music using these headphones are amazed at the sound quality. Because its a closed headphone, it blocks out most of the sound. I'm not sure how long the cord is, but its probably 9-12 feet. While this headphone is great for most music, I wouldn't recommend it for those into classical and other types of music that doesn't really use bass. It definately was made for those who want more bass in their music. When you first use these headphones the sound quality will be awesome, but I wouldn't suggest turning the music up too loud until after some hours of usage. I hooked mine up to the stereo and turned the volume up to an acceptable level and left it playing over night. The sound quality does get better.While I loved these headphones so much, I decided to give away mine. Actually, I accidentally left it in a classroom and someone took it. At least they'll be listening to some good music. Because they're so good, I just added another to my cart. As soon as I have the money I'm buying it.

$REVIEW.: The case itself is solid and well made. The frame is strong and the handle is comfortable to use. The non-rolling version of this bag is excellent and I had hoped the same for this version with wheels, but the problems are with the handle and wheels. The handle does not lock in the up position. There are some spring-loaded tabs that extend when the handle is up, but they easily give way and the handle collapses. This makes it impossible to push this case in front of you, as the handle will collapse. You must pull this case behind you. It also makes it impossible to use the handle as a place to hang your jacket or blazer. The wheels are simply hard plastic wheels on steel axles, and not skate-type wheels with proper bearings. As a result the rolling resistance is considerable even on smooth concrete, and on carpet this case is difficult to pull.

$REVIEW.: Edit: #4  doesn't work


Not sure if it was like that from the beginning or it stopped working....but I think I checked all of them when I got it...

So maybe it just stopped working
:( so taking away 1 star....thought I had to press longer to turn off but that wasn't the case (u just click) and I just read the review below me and it seems like it turns off when not in use so I'm really happy!!! Changing to 5 stars
U do still need to press the on/off button to turn it on tho.It didn't come with iPhone 5/5s charger


I have one so it's ok but I thought it was weird that it didn't come with it.


I think it came with other smart phone chargers (just the charger ends that connects to 1 cord) that idk what..
It did come with iPhone 4S/iPad 2 charger so both my hubby and I could use it
Of course I can just use with chargers we already have so it's ok anyway


The charger cord is shorter than usual charger, I find that bit inconvenient as well, but we only had 1 iPhone 4S/iPad 2 charger so I'm glad it came with it even tho it's shorter.The actual device is convenient, I think, and I'm happy my hubby got this for me on Xmas since I usually use extension cord both in the master bedroom and living room (and that's why he got it for me)

And it is convenient  that u can charge many devices at one time without using extensions cord! LolRegarding the actual charging power, it seems very good and charges quickly

It is a good device and I highly recommend it.

$review_text.: This is my fist DSLR
 At first I was debating between the T3i and T4i, but finally decided that the touch screen, the STM lens support, and the enhanced video capabilities were worth the step up
 The 18-135 lens is WAY better than the other 18-55/55-250 combo

 It has metal mounts (not plastic) and the image quality is noticeably better


 As a beginner, this camera has optional tips that help you know how to use some of the advanced features which was useful when starting out
 Because this camera is new, it has some features that even the most expensive top of the line Canon's don't have (not saying it is better by any means, but it does have some neat features)

 I love this camera and I'd highly recommend it.

$review_text.: Disappointed. This product has gotten great reviews and I find myself at a loss as to why. Let's start with the claim &#34;100% Genuine Leather&#34;. The outside may be leather but the part of the product holds the iPad in place is not. That part of the product is synthic leather, otherwise known as plastic. The proof is in the hole provided of the microphone at the top, this is burned through and has that plastic buldge, something that can't be done with leather. This area also has a cheap, rough feel to it.If I wasn't considering returning the product I would take a leather tool to the outside of the product to see if it were real or fake leather but I'm inclined to return the product. The exterior does not have the feel of leather, it feels like plastic. The interior material is a cloth that has the feel of suede but has the look of a inexpensive cloth which was dirty when the product arrived. It does hold the iPad well however the corners are very exposed and I fear the iPad would not survive a drop.The bottom line it, the product is disappointing and not exactly as advertised.

It is easy to use and so far, very reliable with excellent sound quality. The RCA website setup for the Slacker account would not, for unknown reasons accept my email address, so I could not set up the Slacker account, but I easily set up the internet radio function using the radio controls.

$review_text.: The BP-718 battery that came with my Canon Vixia M500 records for 120 minutes per charge, so I expected much more out of these BP-727 batteries.  Sadly, one of them will only record for about 60 minutes before the camera dies and the other battery died after 27 minutes of recording.  I'm very disappointed in the outcome.  My next battery purchase will definitely be a genuine Canon battery.Looking at the positive side of things.  I now have two external chargers that seem to work fine the Canon battery that came with my camcorder.  Plus, the one new battery that lasted 60 minutes can still be of some use.  I'd say I got my $25 worth, but not near as much as I was expecting.

$review_text.: This is a simple review and the D5100 is simply amazing! I visited many stores to try different brands and models, including its closest competitor Canon Rebel T3i. I also borrowed from friends to try as well. In the end, D5100 was the winner based on my hands-on experience. You probably have read numerous reviews and got more confused. I was one of you. My advice: visit a store and try cameras yourself.I like the way D5100 fits in my hands (good ergonomics); it is lighter and smaller to carry around (in comparison with other DSLRs); though it is made of plastic (most entry- and mid- level DSLRs are) yet very solid and well- built; its shutter sound is music to my ear; its menu is instinctive and thus easy to get used to; the swivel 3" LCD screen is very convenient; its battery life is relatively long, especially if you use viewfinder instead of live-view most of the time (you should try to do so, as most pros do); its auto-focus is swift and accurate, no "hunting" most of the time; it takes sharp and beautiful pictures, thanks to its newly updated software and hardware; lastly, I like the silver shutter button (I am vain)!However, if you have a smaller budget, the D3100 is the next best thing, and it produce wonderful pictures, too. If you can afford, of course get the D7000 with more buttons to play with and a heavier body to carry around, though the picture quality is about the same as D5100 (same sensor and pixel count) in most shooting conditions.In addition, the kit lens (18mm - 55mm) it comes with is surprisingly good and sharp (tested by "professionals"), which means that you don't need to upgrade your lens gears right away until you are ready to (or your finance allows you to). Believe me, the camera body may become the cheapest asset once you get into serious photography. The lenses are expensive, but they do keep their values. On the other hand, camera body, like cars, depreciates.I am not bias towards Nikon and against others. In fact, I have Sony and Canon, and still own 35mm film Nikon and Pentax. From my experience, D5100 is the best in its class that fits all my needs and most requirements. At the beginning of my search, I charted pros and cons of all possible candidates and ended without conclusions. Then, I realized that, just like buying a car, I needed to "test drive" the cameras also! After all, buying a DSLR is not an easy decision, because it is not a cheap toy (for me anyway) and may accompany for years to come.Furthermore, D5100 can dress-up or dress-down. For a professional, it offers most functions (and some more) that you can fine tune and adjust. However, if you just want an upgrade from a point-n-shoot, it has AUTO and SCENES that you don't need to fiddle anything yet take amazing pictures. Just practice and familiarize with the camera's buttons and functions, you will be very happy with it.Remember, a camera is only a tool. YOU, the photographer, are the one that takes good (or bad) pictures, not the camera. In this modern era, most DSLRs are capable of producing sharp and colorful pictures. The pixel counts, sensors, noises, abrasions, or distortions, etc. can be meaningless, if you don't know how to take good pictures. My conclusion: D5100 is an excellent tool to practice and explore your artistic skills.

$review_text.: So I'll preface this with the statement that Garmin is the sole option if you want GPS navigation with cycling in mind. no one challenges them.....YET... Overall this unit works (excluding the many bugs and issues being reported) and it works better then anything else you can find on the market today. It IS the gold standard... while I will say that standard is rather weak. At the cost of this thing is totally overpriced.You would be out of your mind to upgrade from the 800 to the 810... you essentially get nothing of value new. same garbage screen, same buttons, same case, same mount, same functionality.What you do get is one thing. a Bluetooth feature designed to drain your iPhone/Android battery while providing near-useless functionality to auto-upload your rides to Garmin Connects website which very few cyclists use. Most use Strava or RideWithGPS. You get a silly view of what the current weather is in case you believe your own eyes are lying to you.That about sums this thing up. This is a perfect example of where a company owns an entire market segment and choose to make no progress since no one is challenging them. Garmin support is poor on their best days and bugs go unresolved for years and across generations of devices.  They simply do not care.So I'll return this, keep my Edge 800 and I will be happy with the 800 knowing there's nothing else out there.Anyone coming from an 800 - don't waste your time - it's IDENTICAL. If you stuck 1000 Garmin 800 users in a room and asked them to pick one thing they would like to see improved... they would all tell you. Put a better screen on it, and some extra battery life would be nice.  Garmin went with using the same 1970's etcher-sketch screen and decided to actually reduce battery life... just goes to show how much they listen to the customer or care about their market segment.I'm not sure I can even justify or recommend the 810 over the 800 to first-time GPS buyers... it's NOT worth $50.00 compared to the 800. and unless you really need visual map navigation, just get the lower Garmin line and pocket hundreds.Overall - SUPER disappointed in Garmin.  And most likely this will be the last edge unit as this technology will be obsolete in a year.  we should be seeing some challenges coming soon when someone makes a Bluetooth 4.0 set of sensors or figures out a good universal Ant+ phone adapter... Then it's just a iPhone/Android applications taking advantage...which some already do!If you don't need a cycling GPS this season and you own a smart phone... wait, the Garmin's days are numbered... especially since they offer no improvements in the past 5 years.

$review_text.: This is an excellent cable and my office uses these. Nice, no data issues, nice color!TRIVIA FACT: RJ45 is a type of connector commonly used for Ethernet networking. The "RJ" in RJ45 stands for "Registered Jack," since it is a standardized networking interface. The "45" simply refers to the number of the interface standard. Each RJ45 connector has eight pins, which means an RJ45 cable contains eight separate wires.

$review_text.: I'm an Apple fanboy, but while a brand-new Mighty Mouse is a pleasure to use, it soon becomes dirty and cannot be cleaned. I mean, they GLUED it together. I don't care for wireless mice (just wasted batteries for no reason). Trackpads are fine on a laptop, but for Photoshop, etc. something with a bit more precision works for me. Sadly, Apple now thinks it knows better than its customers, so look elsewhere for a better mouse. It will no doubt be less expensive.

$review_text.: I would not recommend purchasing this product unless you have very specific needs. This tablet will allow you to use Photoshop more efficiently and will allow you to occasionally marked documents and e-mails with arrows, circles, and short words. Anything outside the above mentioned applications are stretching this tablets capabilities. You can download a number of free games but I have found it is easier to play these games with a mouse instead of this tablet pen. I've also had trouble configuring this tablet to make the left-click work properly.I do still have this tablet attached my computer no driver or software issues that conflict with other programs. I do occasionally use it for marking something on a screen shot or making a short note on a document. I had high hopes that this tablet would allow me to interact with my computer and new and intuitive ways. I was disappointed.I found writing words or phrases using this tablet easier than a mouse but not very efficient. This tablet does come with handwriting recognition which works but is slow. Penfight (free game that comes with the tablet) is actually pretty fun along with the electric simulated drum set also a free program.

$review_text.: Installation was a snap: I double-checked that the included installation CD contained the latest version of the driver that I could find online. I ran the installer. I shut down the computer, opened the case, slipped the card into my last PCI Express x1 slot using the already attached standard bracket, and hooked everything back up. (There was a low-profile bracket included that I didn't need.) The card was the shortest of my three PCI Express x1 cards (shorter than my TV card and my wi-fi card), so I put in the slot closest to my PCI Express x16 video card. (The other two cards would have covered the cooling fan.)Upon boot-up, I plugged in an external USB 3.0 enclosure with a Seagate Barracuda 3TB drive and ran a disk test with winsat. Winsat reported read rates at 127 MB/s and write rates at 109 MB/s. (Copying 1.2 worth of large files TB from an internal drive to the Seagate averaged in the mid-80 MB/s.)The card also provided a nice speed boost for a 1TB LaCie USB 2.0 drive compared to my Dell's on-board USB ports. Winsat reported read/write rates at 27 MB/s using an on-board USB port, and 36 MB/s using the other port on the new card.

$review_text.: Had to edit review. First impression didn't last long.I'm impressed. I had gotten a Zeki media streaming box at Walmart, and the mouse was so buggy I wasn't even able to set it up properly. Got a google Chromecast, and had to control it with my phone as it wasn't compatible with my tablet, and wasn't able to download the google cast extension, as it isn't compatible with android - so that meant I would have to pick movies from that tiny screen on the phone. Didn't want to fire up my laptop to access the web thru Chromecast (what's the point of that) Took the chromecast back. So - I was skeptical.I got this 2 days ago, and it was very easy to set up. Netflix is a little pixilated at first, but straightens out after a few seconds. No big deal. I have a roku, and it gives descriptions of movies without clicking on the movie (Favi doesn't) but the Favi lists similar movies when you click to get a description. So it's a swapoff.Youtube works very well, which is a joy since I watch a lot of instructional woodcarving video.Easy to install apps. Easy to use browser.I use this on a TV that is on the second floor. My router is downstairs, and about 30-40 feet from the TV. I've had no connectivity problems. Occasionally a Netflix video will rebuffer, but I had that problem with Roku and the Blu-ray player that we have on the same level as the router.Bottom line - I'm keeping this one.EDIT - Changed my mind after a week. It worked fine for a couple of days-then youtube videos were slow to load, then Netflix wouldn't play, then youtube wouldn't load video at all. Firmware update wouldn't download. I tried for a week, but sent it back.

$review_text.: Over the years, I have owned, and used, dozens of USB hubs; from mini 4 port hubs you can travel with, up to 10 and 12 port hubs.  Our notebook computers are not keeping up with the voluminous number of gadgets, and devices, we want to connect at one time, making the Satechi 10-Port USB 3.0 Hub a really great solution.The unit is well designed with a sleek black finish, blue indication lights, and on/off switches. The power adapter is detachable (over 5 feet Long), and so is the USB connection cable (3 feet long).  I was surprised at how small the unit is, at just over 8.5 inches long, 1.5 inches wide and 1 inch high; great size for leaving on your desk or attaching (with the included double sticky adhesive) to the side of your desk.  The hub is separated into four main use points: three sets of three USB ports with each set being controlled with an on/off switch; and on the end, a port capable of charging an iDevice, such as the iPad.  Not many hubs, or even chargers, can make the claim they actually charge an iPad, so this is an excellent feature, including the option to control power to the different sets of ports independently.  These are unique features, not readily available on most competing products.The Satechi 10-Port hub has a power supply rated at 5 amps (5000mA), which is the highest power output I have found among the many hubs currently on the market.  This product is a necessity for charging your devices, and syncing them with your computer at the same time.  While testing the unit, I was able to use all nine USB 3.0 ports at the same time, recognized by my computer; and the 10th charging port for use with a tablet with no slow down in speed or capacity to power.  For example, to max out the unit, I connected 7 external hard drives to it (2WD Elements 2 TB USB 2.0 Desktop External Hard Drive, 4 Western Digital Passport Drives and 1TOSHIBA 1TB Backup Portable Hard Drive USB 3.0&2.0) and a camera, plus my Nexus 7 (for charging).  Read/write speed is just as I would expect, if I plugged each respective device directly into my computer.What's in the box:-One (1) 3.0 USB to USB connection Cable (3 ft. lenth)-One (1)  5V/5AMP power Adaptor (over 5 ft. length cable)-One (1)  double sticky adhesive strip for use in securing to the side of a desk, a wall or even your computer-The 10 port hubThe Satechi 10-Port USB 3.0 Hub is a fantastic product.  It offers more space for connecting your gadgets to your computer, and is a fast, perfectly streamlined, full featured hub.Disclosure: I received a sample product from the manufacturer for the purposes of providing this review.

$review_text.: I have had this little gem of a speaker for about 6 months.  I did a lot of research and actually first bought a Sony Wi-Fi product that worked with the computer but it didn't work with Bluetooth directly which is what I thought it would do.  On the plus side the amplified Sony Wi-Fi was just amazingly loud and clear.  Which was actually a bad thing.  My bathroom wall is attached to the neighbors and I shower late at night.  So that wouldn't work.I looked around at a bunch of products and settled on this one.  It is fantastic.  I don't usually gush over a product.  But then again it's rare that something outperforms your expectations.  This little guy was used in primarily while showering.  It sits plugged into the cable which I plug into an usb wall adaptor that I had left over from another phone.  It has worked perfectly.  Synchs up to several phones, although my iPhone has started having a harder time since I update the software, but overall it has been great and it's plenty loud.  It's pretty good sound quality overall and it just works.I was going to buy another for the garage but ended up with another system in there so I didn't.  But it's portable and you can take it outside with you and have it for music or anything you want to listen to.  There are other products that do little things here and there better.  But for general use, this is just a great product.  She loves having her music when she showers and gets ready, and what else could I ask for from a product.

$REVIEW.: The item did not include the USB to Dock Cable that is shown in the photo.  Received just the card reader module.  This is one of the problems of Amazon's listing system where they combine listings from multiple sellers under one catalog item.  I work for a company that sells on Amazon and this is a constant issue, so I am not blaming the seller on this.  The device is more than worth the price even without the dock cable.  If you want the dock cable, you may want to contact the seller first to confirm before ordering.I have cameras that use CF cards and SD cards.  For some reason the iPad readers for CF cards cost 5x more than SD+USB readers like this one.  I was originally going to buy both iPad readers until I saw the USB port on this one.  I already own an external USB CF reader for my laptop, so I figured that I would get this adapter and give it a try.  It worked Fine.  It saved me $30 and also gave me support for both SD & CF cards.

$REVIEW.: Admittedly, as other reviews have said, this device may have greatly differing effect as between different source devices.  So, I can only share my immediate experience with my particular hardware, for what it's worth.I recently purchased a nice set of noise-cancelling headphones... Sennheiser PXC 450s.  I use them with both a Sony PSP and an Ipod Touch.  Great headphones... I do a lot of recording studio work and one of Sennheiser's mics is my favorite mic in the world.  But I digress.I've tested these headphones with both units (and my Macbook Pro laptop).  My basic feeling is that they don't change the "sound" a whole lot...  Not a lot of color.  This is good, particularly for a device in this price range (a high dollar headphone amp would add color; the sort you would want, but color from a cheap device would likely be "bad").Most importantly, though, they just don't provide much in the way of added volume.  In technical terms i'd guess they add something in the range of 3-6dbu. It's discernible...  The volume does go up.  But it's not a lot.  It's not really sufficient, in my opinion.  I'd have preferred about twice the volume boost that this device seems to provide (at least with these particular audio sources).So... it's useful, but weaker than one would like.Besides that, the form factor is good (it's small and pretty unobtrusive), and the feature set is good (bass boost works well enough; the buttons make sense, and the USB charging works well).  Only thing I might have liked to see in terms of features is a volume level indicator (you just have to listen and see).Unfortunately, I don't have any recommendations for an alternate device at this point.  I'll probably hold on to this one for a while and see how it performs over the course of a few airplane flights.  If it's insufficient, I'll look for something else (and will probably have to go up in cost and size).  I suspect it will generally suffice, though, the majority of the time.  There will probably just be a few instances where I really need more volume and will wish that this one had it.To reiterate what others have said...  It's good, for what it is [but it's not quite a total winner due to the volume thing].
$review_summary.: Not bad..

$REVIEW.: I was under the impression that this was two pieces connected via a hinge, but was pleasantly surprised to find that it was two separate components.  One, that fits the lower half of the iPad (form fitting the new iPad as I had hoped), and the second part works exactly like Apple's outrageously priced smart cover.  The magnetic hinge attaches quickly and firmly allowing it to lie flat on the screen, which as described by the vendor, is compatible with the new iPad by putting it to sleep immediately.  And just as quickly, awakens when opening the cover and remains awake even when the cover is now draped along the bottom of the iPad.  As with Apple's smart cover, this also folds into a triangle to elevate the back of the iPad for comfortable typing, however I found that folding it to elevate it to a higher viewing angle was more difficult to keep upright -- something an inexpensive, small, three-point picture holder works well at.Overall, the quality is good, adding a visually appealing protection from scratches and other trivial mishaps without the added cost that others are charging.

$REVIEW.: I needed a couple of extra camera batteries for a long trip I planned.  These fit my Nikon D80 which I used to make almost 4,000 pictures on a driving trip to Alaska last summer.  They worked well.  I rotated three batteries in my camera and never had any problem having a fresh charged battery on hand in my motorhome at all times.Charles

$review_text.: I have probably purchased and returned 5 wired headphones from here. Each time never totally satisfied.  The same thing happened while looking for a bluetooth set. They were either to hard on the ears, too cheap feeling, and the beat goes on, la dee da dee da. .lolWell with these headphones, the beat really does go on! The main problem I found with many was &#34;no bass&#34;. No wait..that's not right..No &#34;bottom&#34;. That's what set these apart for me. You can actually &#34;feel&#34; the sub. My test for this was listening to &#34;Stanley Clarke&#34; Lord of the low frequencies.  Not over powering, but just enough to know it's there.The highs and mids are there also. My only beef is the bright flashing blue bluetooth connected light.Also I'm not sure but it seems that the pitch changes with some songs. I'll have to keep and ear on that. Oh one more thing..The cord that came with it to use if the batteries go down was DOA. . Other than that I'm 5 Star satisfied..

$REVIEW.: My mother was having problems with her wireless connection and had a neighbor (computer expert) try to fix it

Needless to say he messed up even more

I was traveling down there for a couple days so I order this router just in case
It arrived 10 minutes before I did, and was up and running 10 minutes later
Easy plug and play connections, network and power cables were already plugged into the unit

I like the slot at the bottom of the unit to keep the router info, very convenient and sure will come in handy when mom forgets her password.

$review_text.: I relied too much on ratings, I'm afraid, since my first Sony Reader was not only illiterate, but totally blind


And I lived with this challenge


But, feeling flush and a bit sorry hearing of Sony's woes, I splurged for another


Bad idea

Very bad idea
With the first, the Reader worked sporadically, but the USBs died immediately

Here the USB are fine, for now, but the reader died after only one performance.Since I no longer have the packaging, I guess I'll live with it.

$review_text.: I thought these would be great for me since I wanted a pair that will not slip out of my ear canal while running. However, the problem is, the cord to these ear buds somehow allows vibrations and external noise to travel through the cord which I have never noticed with my other two headphone sets.I decided to just tap the cord about ten inches away from my ears and it vibrates very loudly. It is as if someone were tapping the actual ear buds. That is how loud it can be heard while trying to listen to my recordings. When I simply move my head from side to side the dragging of the cord can be heard also and is very annoying.I may provide updates later for this product after some use but to be honest I am not happy with this purchase. I am going to inquire about sending this item back. Although the Skullcandy ear buds I purchased at Marshall's fall out of my years while running, I can wear them without problem while walking and they were only $12. And just to be sure I was not imagining things I tried using my Skullcandy ear buds again just to make sure that I didn't hear the same interference. I tapped the cord of my Skullcandy ear buds and moved my head from side to side and do not notice any interference. But with MEElectronics M6-BK I hear way too many vibrations. I'm actually irritated with the video review that was provided on amazon.com because that fellow apparently didn't think this was a concern. And it was because of this video that I felt confident in buying them in the first place.

$review_text.: This product is so great, it tempted me into being bad.I bought it as a Christmas present for my son

 Between his multitude of electronics and his hobbies, I figured he could use it
 It arrived
 I saw it, and, well, I became a bad mother and kept the gift for myself
 To be fair, I DID get him other stuff, but I still feel a little twinge of guilt whenever I pull it out.It's the kind of gizmo you just think everyone could use

 It makes a person feel clever to have found it!  I kinda feel smug when I pull it out, all neatly loaded with items

 It makes you look organized, even if you really are not


 It will make you look good.I use it in a carry-on zippered tote bag

 I carry my I-pod touch, ear buds, I-pod folding stand, power cords, pens and a Kindle
 Now I don't have to rummage around looking into a black tote bag that swallows everything


 I no longer have a tangle of wires

 I love this thing.

$REVIEW.: Saw these on sale for 50.00 and snatched them up with out a second thought due to name brand not to mention the trademark GOLD that I thought was superior and probably is to the SILVER headphones they sell

Had them collecting dust for quite some time because I was waiting for my Brainwavz M2 to go bad before I used the Klipsch
The Brainwavz finally went out after a long, long, ridiculous long beating and I jumped at the chance to use the Klipsch with a smile, and let me tell you my face just formed a confused look as I was thinking out loud "You have got to be kidding me with this junk!" Perhaps I spoiled myself with the Brainwavz M2 because I actually thought that these Klipsch should and must sound better, again due to name brand and crazy cost


It does not end there, the cheap plastic wiring had me thinking as to why not use what the M2s use instead of what the worst of the worst like "Scull Candy" uses? The M2s wire is clearly a superior wire and obviously made to last longer
So my question is, if the technology for the robust wire is available why not use it on a high end item like the Klipsch? The answer is painfully obvious, Klipsch is not a high end brand just the cost of one, like all the other junk brands out there use the cheapest material for cost and above all mede to be faulty sooner so we can rush out a buy another pair again, basically designed to fail


Getting back to the sound the best way to describe it would be it's just fine, not great but not bad, but it did show me what a superior sound the M2s have over these and other brands.At this point it might look like I'm becoming a Brainwavz "Fan Boy" of you might think I do PR or something for them, but rest assured that I have a favorite pair of headphones for everything these days.For My TV/home theater watching, I use the wireless Sennheiser RS 170 the are second to none!For my android phone and ipad I use the Bose MIE2 Mobile Headset again second to none.For travel I use my Bose QuietComforts 15, as of yet I still cant find a better sounding headphone with Noise Canceling.Computer I use the sony xb500 due to the extra cushion and comfort for prolonged time over the ear, sound great too, replaced my awesome but expensive V-MODA Crossfade LP!!Finally for wear to bed and sleep with earbuds I'm sticking with the best of the best the Brainwavz M2.Anyway hope this helps someone out there make a better decision, and to Klipsch "Shame on you for this terrible product, sorry to say that it turned me off to your brand in general!".

$review_text.: I bought this as open box from Warehouse deals, and it came in the original packaging looking brand new


If you're going to buy one of these, wait for an open box from them, it saves a bunch of money and you wont be able to tell the difference

This receiver works great for me, I have the polk 6750 speaker set with it and they really sound fantastic
The four HDMI inputs are great, and just so it is clear, it takes the audio from the source and DOES send it to the TV, so you dont always have to use surround speakers if you don't want to
I have a Blu ray player, Xbox 360, and Wii connected to it and they all look/sound fantastic


The automatic setup with the speakers works well, i tweaked it a little bit to get my center channel to play louder since it's a little weak, but overall it was painless and really simple

I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a high quality receiver, especially if you're deciding between buying one of the lesser-featured receivers like i was (the yamaha 365BL or the 6230).

Given the small price difference I see no reason to buy the CS1 instead of this, unless you cannot fit this larger center for some reason.  Your center channel is where a majority of the sound comes from so I would consider it even more important then other speakers.  Mine is mounted above my wall mounted television.  It does look a little odd sticking out, but that is alright because it sounds good.

$review_text.: I purchased this IP security camera to use while away on vacation so I could "check in" on my house to give me peace of mind.  I purchased the camera directly from Foscam because I wanted the full support and not the problems with support that I had read about here on Amazon.  I have a Motorola NVG510 cable modem and thought there might be a problem with setup.  I let Foscam support wirelessly control my PC (they did not charge me, and I stated that I did not want to pay $40.00 for their help) to set up the camera and watched what settings were changed.  I had tried to set up the camera myself and I did it all correctly except for changing one setting which was enabling TCP for the camera, not both if you aren't sure.  The way to set this up using the NVG510 is to create a NAT gaming profile labeled "Foscam" and use port 8090 then host that port which leaves it open.  You need to be outside of your own network in order to see it at the address which is your fixed IP address and the port number that you have opened for the camera.  You don't need a DynDNS if you have the NVG510 and AT&T; U-Verse, it is a static connection that doesn't change - it is always the same IP address - just write down the number for future reference.  There isn't any support for the Motorola cable modem from AT&T; and people make a much bigger deal out of setting this up because there isn't accurate information available.  You don't need a separate LAN or ethernet or any more network equipment.Now, for the review of the camera itself:  it doesn't seem to work properly at all other than being a remote viewing device.  It takes pictures when there isn't any motion, and most of the time when there is motion it doesn't take pictures at all.  When I turn my light on in the living room, the camera comes to life and starts clicking and taking pictures.  In reviewing the snapshots e-mailed to me, a lot of them are empty of any persons (me) walking by it.  The sensitivity setting is on 10 which is the setting the Foscam rep set it at.  I left it on that setting because I don't have any animals or children that might trigger it.  When I was away and accessed the camera over the internet, I could not get it to pan around unless I used the horizontal or vertical patrol function.  So I am almost wishing at this point that I had not purchased this camera.  I might change this review after I work with it a bit longer, but it seemed to be working at first now it works when it feels like it.  I will try rebooting it frequently to see if that makes a difference.The picture quality is very good and clear, the color is what you would expect from a camera of this price - I am not making a movie so the colors don't need to be perfect - they are very close and the light blue walls and pictures are the right colors.  I was able to look around my living room and see that my stereo and TV were still there which made me feel less anxious while I was away from home for a week.However, I am not happy at all with the fact that the camera is not reliable at all for the motion detection function which is a major reason I purchased it.

$REVIEW.: when you open your package you will see that it looks really sturdy and well built and i honestly believe thats what is causing all of its problems, its really not that flexable so when you try to maneuver the cable so that it fits to your liking in a tight place you run the risk of damaging the wire, which is what is hapening to me.sometimes the image doesnt show so i have to go behind my receiver and jiggle the wire so that the image finally pops up i have cheaper hdmi cables that work better than this one because its flexible so you dont run the risk of damaging the wire too much if you have to fit it in a tight place.if you ask me this cable is nice if you have a wide open place to put it in where you know the wire wont have to bend that much, but if you do have to bend just know that the wires can get damaged easier on this hdmi than ones that have a soft rubber encasement.
$SUMMARY.: Sturdy? well built? um kinda....

$REVIEW.: This machine has to be seen to appreciate how clear the picture is on the display and how easy it is to work on for any length of time

The laptop was easy to set up and got me working quickly on a project for graduate school
The graphics are wonderful and Photoshop pictures look so good compared to a laptop that I purchased 2 years ago that it makes me smile just to think about how good the tech is on this baby! The only thing that was a little disappointing was that when I did a review of laptops, apparently ASUS isn't known for their customer service
So, just in case, I purchased a 3 year Square Trade Warranty to go along with this
I like this laptop very much and would definitely say to buy one if you can!

$REVIEW.: This device is nothing new, and is what mechanics know as an ODB2 diagnostic scanner. AutoZone/Checkers/O'Reily/Pep Boys/etc. often have these available to borrow for free to see what error code (check engine light) your vehicle is producing. There are varying models and makes of these scanners, and the more advanced ones can reset/remove the error codes from the car. This is a useful tool, and can save you money, but it is not the only tool you should have. Common sense should also be in everybody's toolbox as well. If your car is running rough, if you brakes squeal or become spongy (when you depress the pedal), or if you have a burned out bulb - all of these things will NOT register on this device, nor any other ODB2 scanner, but should be repaired. The scanner can also be very ambiguous about the problem, or completely misdiagnose the problem completely; but will generally point you in the direction of what needs to be repaired. The oxygen (O2) sensor is a good example of this, where it could be a bad sensor or a more severe/complicated issue.This is what people need to understand; this product is designed to read the diagnostic codes of your car and tell you what the CAR THINKS it is. The device itself does NO ACTUAL DIAGNOSTIC work, only reading the code that the vehicle produces. The only real benefits of THIS device compared to other ODB2 scanners is the fact that it can print some fancy reports, break down what the diagnostic code means into layman terms, and give a basic cost analysis of what it would take to fix the problem assuming the diagnostic code properly reflects the issue; in a single package. You can find the diagnostic codes and what they mean, as well as parts prices via a quick search on Google/Bing/Yahoo/Alta Vista/Webcrawler/Ask Jeeves/Whatever. This product packages it together, which is a nice feature. However, the more advanced features such as resetting codes, history, trip time, etc. are not available on this unit, and for the price you pay on this guy, you may be better served spending the extra 30 minutes looking the information up online and simply getting a better qualilty ODB2 scanner that doesn't limit you on the number of vehicles you can sync to. Recalls are also available online for you to access as well, without having to purchase this particular product. However, if time is an issue and the limitation to sync reports to only 3 automobiles is not a deal breaker, the report function is a nice feature.The market that this device is catering to is for those who have little automechanical experience. I should warn you, most lemonlot salesmen will not leave a check engine light on in a vehicle they plan to sell. They will simply "reset" the codes if the car is having a problem, effectively preventing the car from displaying the check engine light and the malady that affects it. Sorry to say, this device is unlikely to save you from a bad buy from a used car dealership.Save some money and do the following if you want to save on repairs:1) Buy an ODB2 code scanner, a Hayne's/Chilton's manual, and a tool set that includes a quality socket set.2) If your car "tells" you there is something wrong (see first paragraph for non-code registering repairs), and you feel comfortable fixing it with assistance from the afforementioned items  above, do so.3) If not, take it to a quality mechanic. If a code was available, it at least saves you the diagnostic fee ($50-$100) and pointed you in the general direction of the repair (engine/transmission/electrical/exhaust/etc).
$SUMMARY.: A lot of hype, but just another ODB2 scanner...

$REVIEW.: After waiting over five months for what I thought was going to be a terrific camera to hit the shelfs, I simply hadto send it back after having it for only two days....Now, I've had over eight (8( digital camera's and I do love them so!...The reason I bought this camera was for its "Movie" capabilities. My hobby is creating "slideshows with music", and I've done many of them. So, I had planned to use not only photos in the slideshow, but also some "video" also, just to have the slideshow flow with  a bit more variety.I'd also like to add that I"m stricly a Canon person. Yes, I'm sure there are other super cameras out there, but I know and understand Canon cameras,so, I"ll just stick with them.What I find a bit strange here is that since I'm a Canon person, why did I rate it only One (1) star?...Each Canon camera I've had in the past I've loved!.  Here was the problem:  The "Wheel" on this camera simply didn't turn well at all. It would "hesitate" and move just when it felt like. And, the Movie mode ergonimics waswhat I felt "Clumsy"...Of all the eight (8( Canon Camera's I've owned, I've never ever returned one!. And, the ergonomics on ALL of those cameras was superb!..  My very first Canon camera was the S330 Elph, some eight years ago, and right from the box, it took me no time to set it up!. And so were all the other Canons that easy also..And, the Audio on this camera's supposed to have great stereo audio? When I played back the movie that I had taken with it, the audio sounded pretty bad to my ear.[...] I've purchased other cameras from them in the past, and have never returned anything to them, buy even though their delivery was super fast, I got the camera in 48 hours. But, you can be sure I'll not be buying another camera from them simply because of their restocking charge.To be fair, after I had rated this camera a One (1) star, I realized that I had rated it incorrectly. When I then went to rate it for Three (3) stars, the Amazon interface or whatever, would not allow me to change the one star to a three star.I'm sure that this camera will be just right for many people and my dilemma with it will most probably not be similar to others who have this camera or are going to buy it.

$review_text.: Amazon seems to think the 8 port and the 16 port switches should share the same review.  I disagree and I've written 2 separate reviews that I'll need to put together here...Review for the 8 port switch (4.25 stars):TP-LINK TL-SG1008D 10/100/1000Mbps 8-Port Gigabit Desktop Switch, 10Gbps Switching CapacityI tested the power saving features using my Kill-a-Watt.  Under no load, this switch was pulling .01 Amps (less than 1 watt).  I suspect it was actually even less than that since it was also showing 0 watts and technically .01 amps at 110 volts would be just over 1 watt (not counting power factor).  If you see the comparisons I did in the 16 port switch review, you'll see that this is the most energy efficient switch I tested.  Big plus there.The only thing I would have liked to see differently is to have the casing be metal instead of plastic.  Not only does it feel sturdier, but it dissipates any heat it generates better so you can put it in even smaller places (although, as noted--since it uses less power, it doesn't generate as much heat in the first place).  Not a huge deal--I would remove only 1/4 of a star for that.  The other nice thing would have been to have different color LEDs or some other indication to show what speed you were connected at.  Again, not a huge deal--only a 1/2 star for that, too.Recommended.------------------------------------------------------Review for the 16 port switch (4.75 stars):This model has a metal case and feels solid.  Each port sports 2 lights--1 to indicate a link is active and another to indicate if it is connected at gigabit speed (if it is 100 or 10 Mbps, then the second LED does not illuminate).  The switch is unmanaged so there is no interface to review.  This is also not a PoE switch, so there is nothing to say about power distribution.With the exception of really bad products, you would expect any switch to stay up 100% of the time and not cause any network issues and thus far, that has been the case for me.  Unless you are really able to test nitty-gritty network speeds or if you have a real need for jumbo frame sizes (this supports 10K frames), etc., the one area that sets one switch apart from another is power consumption, although even here, most products are going to be very close. I tested the power saving features using my Kill-a-Watt and comparing it to other switches I have access to.  Most of the gigabit switches I have also boast power-saving features.  My non-power saving switches (and a hub) are all too old to be gigabit, though I'm not sure if that inherently changes power usage or not.  All tests were done under no load since that's where the power saving is most apparent. Here are my resultsGigabit switchesTP-LINK TL-SG1008D 16 port: 6 watts / 16 ports = .375 watts / portTP-LINK TL-SG1008D 8 port: less than 1 watt / 8 ports = less than .125 watts / portnon-power saving, 10/100 switchesCisco Catalyst 2950: 23 watts / 50 (48 + 2) ports = .46 watts / portNetgear F3605: 1 watt / 5 ports = .2 watts / portEZ500S: 1.5 watt / 5 ports = .3 watts / portreally old 10/100, 4 port hub: 2 watts / 4 ports = .5 watts / portAs you can see, even though this boasts power saving features, it is by no means the most efficient power user in watts / port.  If your goal is to use as little power as possible, you'd be better off using 3 of the 8-port switches (or just 2 if 14 ports is OK since you have to link them).  However, I'm sure there are trade-offs--the 8 port, for example, has 1/2 the MAC address table memory, so depending on how it was set up, that could cause some extra look-ups.  Also, the 8 port does not support jumbo frames, to the best of my knowledge.  I suspect since the 8 port switch was so much more efficient, that they could have done SOMETHING to this to make it a bit more efficient, so I'll take .25 stars off on this one, but no more because perhaps they did all they could do with the tech that is currently available.Even though it is not the most efficient on the list, it is still not using much power at all: at 6 watts, you can expect to use about 50 KWH/year--about the same as running a hair dryer for 5 min/day.  I'm paying about $.10 / KWH, so that would be roughly $5/year.  Now, obviously, under load it will use more power than that, but this gives a basic idea.It should be noted that the unit does not require a fan, so it operates nice and quietly. Also note that this is a rack-mountable switch.  The switch itself is pretty small for rack mounting, but comes with large brackets that will allow it to fit into a standard, 1U slot in a 19" rack.Recommended.
$SUMMARY.: nice product

$REVIEW.: I bought these speakers 7 years ago and use them heavily (I listen to music on an almost daily basis through them). I just decided to look them up to find their value as I am looking for a new set with bluetooth capability and am surprised to see them still selling at full price. They are not the loudest but can fill a small room and are great for a non-ipod music player. Sound is very clear and the audio input cord holds up well. Runs on 4 AA but mine are usually plugged in anyway, though the portability is nice. Other reviewers did a good job describing the sound so I just wanted to add to theirs that the durability is exceptionally high. Handles everything a high school and college kid will put them through and are unphased.

I love that because I can easily get to the back to the notebook for plugging things in and out. I couldn't imagine not having one. However, it loses 1 star for the fact that 2 pieces of plastic with rubber pads costs as much as it does.

$review_text.: Everything else works very well except WIFI. I have two wireless routers, one on the upstairs, another downstairs. Our other devices (iPhones, iPads, Lenovo ThinkPad/Asus laptops, Microsoft Surface) all show full signal bars when they are on the same floor as the router, only this IdeaTab K3 shows two (out of five) wireless bars even when I sit just next to the router (either one). When I use it not far away from the router, it loses WIFI connection a lot of times, which makes this IdeaTab be very limited useful. Now we typically use it for watching downloaded video outside of home.I am really surprised Lenovo puts such a poor-quality device on the market!!Not recommended for others!

$REVIEW.: This speaker set really sounds great.  I am an audiophile who would usually go the extra $$ for the best sounding unit (i.e. the Bose Sound Docks or something comparable) but you can only spend so much on peripherals.  FYI, I checked out the various dock options on Amazon.com.  I've heard the JBL On-Stage at a friend's house and liked it, but I was concerned about all the feedback in the reviews about that unit's volume control issues.  Speaker sound is all about personal preference and hearing those speakers in the environment where they will be played.  I went with the Klipsch for 3 reasons - the company is known for making high-end tower speakers, the unit includes an "S" video jack for showing videos and podcasts on my TV and the reviews here and elsewhere were positive.  I normally wouldn't buy speakers without hearing them first, but I relied on the reviews and the company's reputation - and besides, the pricing was good and I could always return the speakers if they didn't sound great in my house.I received the unit and unpacked it in my bedroom, where it will ultimately be used.  It was super-simple to setup - indeed the instruction manual is only 3-4 pages of large type.  I put my iPod on the unit and fired it up.  The sound that came forth was crisp, clean and impressive.  Frankly, not to knock Bose, but the sound was about as good as the sound from my Bose Wave Radio which cost more than 3X what the Klipsch cost.  The sound is excellent with lusty base, crisp treble and superb midrange.  I have played a variety of music and have been continually impressed with the sound reproduction.  Pop, Hip Hop, Classical, Jazz - you name it, this Klipsch really delivers.  And it fills my moderate-sized bedroom with music without any trace or distortion and it sounds very natural.  I haven't used the S-Video hook up to view videos yet, but I'm sure it will work well also.  In my opinion, this is the best unit at the $150 price point - it will not disappoint!Here are my overall pros and cons for the Klipsch:Pros:-> Attractive form factor and reasonably small foot print-> Easy to set up-> Sound quality is excellent - at all ends of the musical spectrum-> Price is very reasonable-> Fills the room with clear, crisp music at any volume level - sounds great on low or played loud-> Has video connection for movies and podcasts - many other speaker sets don't have this featureCons:-> The volume buttons on the unit itself don't have a smooth positive feel - they are stiff in their operation-> A screen like that of the Altec Lansing would be nice so that you could see the volume level and other key operating statistics of the unitBottom Line:  If you appreciate good sound reproduction, this is the unit for you!!!  Take it home and try it - you can return it if you don't like the sound.  But trust me, you'll love it!!!!
$SUMMARY.: Fantastic Sound at a Reasonable Price - No Need to Spend Big $$ to Get Great Sound

$review_text.: If you are looking at this item right now, the most important thing I can tell you first is to be sure it is what you are looking for.  Almost all devices today use Micro, not Mini USB connectors on them.  Your Kindle, Bluetooth Headset, Cell Phone, etc - all of them probably are using Micro-USB and then this is the wrong cable.  Much older peripherals used regular square USB-B connectors.  The Mini-USB is right in the middle.  If your device requires it, then this is the cable for you.The cable features a nice almost rubberized connector on the end that is well attached to the cable itself.  I was impressed it worked with my external USB hard drive.  These external backup drives are often powered from the USB port itself, and require a large inrush current to start spinning.  They ship with cables that are a few inches long because the inductance of a longer cable prevents the drive from spinning.  This is the longest cable I've ever gotten to work with the drive - 3 feet is fairly impressive.  I tried the 6 foot cable and not surprisingly, it did not work.  I'd recommend 3 feet for external hard drives that are powered from USB, and 6 feet for any other application.  The speed worked fine for both.So the data transfers at full rate and at 3 feet it can source enough current to spin up an external backup drive.  Quality seems good enough for general office use, and the price is right.  It is even marked as USB Compliant, something you won't always find if you buy a no-name cable.  Why does that matter?  Because a cable may look like USB, but without the USB compliant stamp, it might not perform properly.  If you are sure you need this size USB connector, you really can't go wrong with this device.
$review_summary.: Impressive little Mini-USB connector - worked well for backup hard drive, just note that it is not Micro

$review_text.: The concept is great, and when it actually works, it's phenomenal. But "when it actually works" is a finnicky balance beam. I'm constantly having connection (wireless) issues with my Roku box. I have to reboot the box, plus reboot my wireless connection at least twice a week. Sometimes it's a 30 minute process from the time I think, "Hmmm, let's watch something on Netflix on Roku" to the time I'm actually watching Netflix on Roku.... just bc of all the rebooting I'm having to do. Here's a typical scenario:1) Turn to Roku2) Running sluggish flipping through Roku channel menu; getting worried3) Select Netflix4) Severe lag in selecting Netflix and when Netflix actually loads onto my screen5) Connection error messageSo, "Connection error" makes me think it's a wireless problem, right? Wrong. Here's a test I ran tonight when I received a "Internet connection error" on my Roku:1) Macbook Pro (wireless) = working fine2) iMac (wired) = working fine3) PC laptop (wireless) = working fine4) XBOX 360 - streaming Hulu, Netflix (wireless, just like Roku) = working fine5) Nintendo Wii (wireless) = working fine6) Two iPhones (wireless) = working fine7) Apple TV (wireless) = working fine8) Roku (wireless) = connection errorNote: The Xbox, Wii, iPhone, and Macbook were all twice as far away from the wireless router as the Roku.This is a constant issue with the Roku box. It seems to work much better when on a wired connection... But that's not going to be happening in my house with my setup.So, if you're thinking about getting a Roku over other streaming devices, remember:1) You'll need to buy a HDMI cable (and ethernet cable if going wired), bc Roku doesn't provide one with its $100 box2) Be prepared to spend 20-30 minutes rebooting your box and modem/router several times at any given point that you decide you're ready to watch a show through your Roku boxAlso.. This thing was obviously made by developers. The user interface is horrific. Come on guys, hire a designer. And maybe instead of focusing on making your next generation hardware smaller... and maybe instead of trying to force us to download Angry Birds or Jeopardy... how about just making your hardware work at the one thing it's supposed to do.

In comparison to those, these headphones are a bit stifling on the ears, I feel that my whole body temperature is rising


Then, as sound is playing and about 20 seconds afterward, there is the sound of static in the background until it makes a popping sound when it stops

Also, music becomes harder to hear while I am eating with these headphones as what happens when your ears are covered firmly.

$review_text.: I very respectfully submit that some of the otherwise excellent reviews here on Amazon have not emphasized what I believe to be the main point about the Apple TV accessory.  That is the fact that the Apple TV can access movies, TV shows or other videos that are on the user's main computer hard disk without transferring the actual data file (e.g. an MP4 file of a movie) to the hard disk drive on the Apple TV unit.  This is a very significant capability.  It means that so long as the user has a desktop PC with lots of hard disk space together with a home WiFi network, the Apple TV unit has complete access to the user's video library regardless of the hard disk capacity of the Apple TV unit.  To me, this is a very big deal, because I have a very large video library stored on my main desktop computer, which my Apple TV accesses via WiFi. (This capability takes advantage of the fact that hard disk space on one's desktop is very inexpensive these days.) The Apple TV effortlessly accesses and streams a movie video directly over WiFi without the need to download it to the Apple TV Hard Disk.  Thus, you are limited only by the disk capacity of your desktop, not by that of the Apple TV.  The Apple TV hard disk is vital, of course, if you use the Apple TV in a portable setting away from your main iTunes desktop and WiFi setup.  Then you are playing the Apple TV as a direct source of video content from its Hard Disk to your TV.  I do this in my boat.To me, the ability to stream content directly from the desktop to one's widescreen TV via the Apple TV is what sets the Apple TV apart from other source devices such as DVD players.  Further, being able to purchase content directly from the iTunes store, even in HD format, adds to the capability of this unit.  I have "bought in" to the whole Apple music and video concept, and those of us who have done so will quickly see that the Apple TV is made for us. The Apple TV interface is a great way to browse the iTunes store for movies or whatnot; I personally prefer doing it that way as opposed to accessing the store on my desktop computer.But even for those who eschew the iTunes store, the Apple TV is terrific if you have other videos such as legally ripped archival MP4 files of movies purchased on DVD, for example.  I also enjoy watching History and Military Channel video podcasts, which can be downloaded for free from the iTunes store onto iTunes and then enjoyed on the big screen via the Apple TV unit.It appears that I am more impressed with the Apple TV unit than many of the other reviewers.  The unit is small, elegant, and attractive.  Smaller than a DVD player, it does far more and it does it in a much more elegant manner, i.e. all of your content is accessible via the Apple TV menus without hassling with individual DVD disks. The cost is similar to a high-end DVD player. I frankly think that DVDs are rapidly becoming obsolete and that direct digital electronic downloads are the future, but I digress.  The unit has wonderful screensaver capability, in sharp contrast to my two DVD players, and various other nice touches.  It is great for a full-screen display of photographs. (I am an avid digital photographer, so I in particular appreciate this.) It is very pleasant (great ambiance for parties) to put on a slide show of one's digital photographs, and stream a music playlist to accompany the slide show.  Very cool.Installation was essentially effortless. The unit immediately recognized my wireless network, and accepted the WEP code.  My main desktop computer immediately recognized the Apple TV and offered to synch.  The Apple TV immediately offered to upgrade its internal operating software over the internet and did so.  Even before synching, my entire video content was available on my widescreen TV through the Apple TV via WiFi streaming.  I was watching a movie from my iTunes library within minutes.  Incredible.Like all Apple products, the Apple TV is beautifully made, and nicely packaged.  I wish that more American companies focused on quality the way Apple does.I agree with other reviewers that the remote for the Apple TV is kind of small and minimalist for what is destined to become the centerpiece of my video library. Strangely, the remote does not even include a volume control. (You can program many third-party remotes to control the Apple TV and I will probably end up going that route although I have not yet done so.) Hilariously, there is an iPhone app that allows one's iPhone to act as a substitute remote ("Remote") and it is not at all bad.  And it is odd how the Apple TV does not even have an "off" switch.  These issues are minor, keep the cost down, and perhaps even add to the simple elegance of the unit.The wireless streaming is what really sets this unit apart, but there is much else to like about it as well.  Apple seems to have a clear vision of the future of digital content, and the Apple TV seems to be ideally situated to capitalize on this vision.

$review_text.: I received this item as a gift because I badly needed more USB ports.Admit it, USB ports are one of those things you can't have to many of.  Seems like computers now a days are limiting the number of ports they come with.  I recently got a top of the line HP Windows 7 Pavilion i7 and it only came with 5 ports.  That is hardly enough to even get me started.  I was using a USG hub, but I knew a PCI card was a better alternative to go.Installation was simple, just insert the card (plug and play) and  install the program from the CD.  Uses a standard 4-pin Molex connector to power USB devices from your PC power supply so does not require any external power sources.  It can draw all the required power from the PCI-E slot.  That was it and I was ready to go.  I plugged in my USB 3.0 external hard drive (which I use for my daily backups), my webcam, and all my of my other USB accessories I have connected to my tower.Honestly I have no clue what rates, speeds or mumble jumbo are since I am not a techie kinda person.  All I know is that I have had no hang-ups or lag times when running my applications and hardware.  It was extremely easy to install on my Windows 7 64-bit OS computer and the PCI-E card itself seems nicely made.  I think the Uspeed Superspeed USB 3.0 PCI-E Card is worth it because going out and buying a new USB 3.0 enable motherboard is expensive and hassle and not worth it.  With the card you can just pop it in and go, and you might as well make it a USB 3.0 that is backwards compatible to 2.0.It does loses a star for not having more detailed instructions.  There is small printed sentence one the outside of the box that states to "Set up PCIE card and then install CD drive".  I knew from previous experience how to install the card, but if this is the first time for someone who has never done this it would be VERY confusing.  There should be some kind of written instructions enclosed with the card.

$review_text.: I understand the frustration by some concerning the lack of a display function - but think about it - once you start moving, you do not need to look at the display - the audio tells you how far you're going. The nano itself is positioned on the outside of your arm - which means if there was a window for the display, you couldn't see it anyway.I think the firmware in the Nike+ module needs to be updated so you get audio feedback on what menu you're pressing - so you can make adjustments while moving/running/crawling w/o having to pull the unit out of the case.Nike has actually done a lot of research to come out w/ patented fabrics that wisk away moisture - the nano fits in there w/ the module like a glove. With this on my fat arm, I could barely feel the thing. I've tried other armbands and this is the most comfortable one I've ever used.My less than perfect rating is for the hole for accessing the audio port needs to be a tad bigger or at least ribbed w/ a gasket or something.  During movement, it can shift and the thin fabric can get between the earbud connector and the audio jack, slightly separating the two and causing yucky sound quality.Also, it would be nice if there was an XXL model for folks w/ bigger arms. This one fits me fine, but if someone w/ arms like the Governator wants to use this - good luck to you.I would also have appreciated some sort of channel for cord for the earbuds to follow. I may start wearding armband upside down so the earbuds can go up my sleeve naturally instead of awkwardly down, then back up. I was aware of the cord to the earbuds rubbing along my arm during my walk.The inside of the armband has silkscreened washing instructions. The scrollwheel, select button and clickwheel work like a charm through the fabric. I see why most people would initially balk at the design - but I do believe the shortcomings are more w/ the software limitations - this lightweight armband is really well designed - it's durable, but you cannot even feel it when it's on.
$review_summary.: fits well, even on my pudgy arms...

$REVIEW.: The 3D concept and execution from this camera is very good. It takes very high quality pictures and is good under various lighting conditions. The reason I gave this only 4 stars is that it is not a point and shoot camera. It is somewhat complicated to get used to all of the settings, and the menus are not particularly intuitive. On the other hand, you can have a lot of control over your pictures in both 2D and 3D and you can even set the camera to take two different pictures in 2D (different ISO, effects, etc.). One thing you have to know is that you need a 3D environment (TV with 3D glasses) to look at the 3D pics or settle for viewing 3D on the viewfinder. 2D is easily imported into any computer.Pros: good battery life, lots of controls, 3D!Cons: maybe too many controls for some; additional optional equipment needed for 3D viewing

$review_text.: If you bring gadgets with you when you travel, this is incredibly handy.  It's fairly compact and very easy to pack - and very useful in hotels where you often don't have enough outlets for your laptop, cell phone charger, and other gadgets.  Since it's on a cord, it helps when the hotel wall outlet is in an awkward place, like behind the night stand next to the bed.  Since so many phones and other gadgets nowadays can charge from a USB port, you are no longer a slave to $30 proprietary chargers. I use mine at home, as well, and will probably get a second one.I also bought a similar product made by Belkin, which has 2 USB outlets (the Monster only has one).  But the Belkin's USB outlets put out less power and people have had trouble when they try to charge two USB devices at the same time.  Plus, the Belkin unit is larger and heavier than you'd think, so it's slightly less travel-friendly.  And it plugs directly into the wall rather than being on a short cord, which isn't as helpful when your hotel room's outlet is in an inconvenient place.Another related item you might consider is the Scosche Dual USB Car Charger, a jack that goes into your car's cigarette lighter outlet and has TWO usb ports for simultaneously charging two devices.Scosche Dual USB Car Charger

$review_text.: The first important aspect of this receiver is that it is 3D capable. If you're not aware, even top notch receivers which aren't will not pass your 3D signals along from 3D content channels to your 3D TV. While you can take those video signals straight to the TV, that sort of defeats the entire idea of transferring all the information ... picture and sound ... through your HDMI cable, as in doing that you would be bypassing your receiver and need to take the sound to the receiver through a separate cable of some sort.This receiver is also ready for 4K media. It will be quite a while before 4K displays and media hit a price point that I'll bite at, so I can't report on that aspect of this receiver. I'm somewhat of an early adopter, but not to the point of wasting ridiculous amounts of money on early versions of technologies, when in a couple of years it will be less expensive, more mature, and more reliable. ;-)The setup of this receiver is the most clear, easiest menu system I've yet seen on a receiver. Everything is unambiguously labeled so you don't have to learn the menu's little lingo to know what menu selections expose what set up option. The mike setup to allow the receiver to adjust its sound fields was easy, and it even detected that I had reversed the polarity on my center speaker by accident, resulting in a loss of power in providing sound for that channel. I quickly adjusted the speaker inputs into the back of the receiver and fixed that issue.There are plenty of inputs, well labeled for all sorts of modern devices. I have a Sony 400 CD device, a Sony 400 DVD device, a Blu ray player, an older Toshiba DVR, the DirecTV box, a turntable, and a VCR. There were plenty of places to plug them in and keep them in labeled spots that made sense. As you setup your devices during the initial setup, the receiver even tells you where to place each device as you identify, and gives you a picture of the back of the receiver to clarify where it is telling you to plug it in. It couldn't possibly be more simple.The remote is easy to use and well laid out. Additionally, Denon has an app to use your iPhone or iPad (or presumably iPod) as a remote control.Finally, the most important element of a receiver: the sound. Sound quality is superb. There is plenty of power from the receiver, so the volume drives nicely to normal levels without pushing the volume up much on the receiver. The sound is of course balanced nicely after the set up. Surround sound really delivers, and this receiver adds my sub-woofer into the experience better than any previous one.Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: Not being someone who has used a hands-free headset before, or someone who engages in a sport, I enlisted the help of my co-workers (I work at a tech company) and my family.  Here are our impressions.Looks and fitAt first glance, everyone liked the look.  The cord tucks easily under your hair (if you have any), and the styling is sleek on the ear.  When setting it down on my desk, the earpieces connect magnetically, and it stands like a small, hi-tech sculpture.  Nice.  When properly worn (it took a minute or so to get it just right) the headset rests comfortably on the inside of the ears, not rubbing or pinching.  After several hours use, it is still comfortable.  One thing to remember, though, is that this is a pair of headphones, covering both ears, so it isn't suited for use while driving a car.SetupSetup was very easy, though not intuitive.  Read the brief instructions!  I tried connecting it to my iPod, iPad, and phone.  It worked within a couple of seconds every time.  My co-worker tested it with his Samsung Galaxy and my son with his iPhone.  Still smooth.HeadphonesNot being a power phone user, and not having a long train commute or walk to work, my primary interest was in whether this headset could replace my wired earbuds.  I know that Bluetooth re-compresses audio before streaming it, so I expected some drop in quality.  I also am not used to the foam "plugs" that are used in this headset, since I work in an open office where I need to hear what people are saying to me, so I tend to prefer Apple earbuds (with no pads).  Initially, I was disappointed with the sound.  The pads muffled both the speakers and outside noise.  I was able, after fiddling with them, to position the speakers better for sound, though the pads still muffled room noise.  I found that the sound was better over the course of the day, maybe because I was more proficient with the placement or maybe because the speakers needed "breaking in".  I don't know.  The sound was never quite as good as my wired earbuds, but it was more than good enough.  N.B. The description in the bulleted overview says that these are noise-canceling. They are not, except that the rubber pads block some ambient sound.  There is no other true noise canceling technology that I can tell, though you could probably guess that from the low price.Phone headsetBesides a couple of tries to see if the headset features worked, I deferred judgement to my 16-year-old.  I asked him if he would test the headset out, and after looking it over he said, "So, you could climb a tree with these while talking on the phone?".  "Sure" I said.  An hour or two later, my wife came in and said, "Your idiot son is 40 feet up in a tree.  Go stand at the bottom so you can call the ambulance as soon as he falls."  When I coaxed him back down, my son said that the headset worked beautifully, never losing signal or slipping even when he was hanging upside-down or swinging from branch to branch.BatteryAfter using the headset for half a day on and off at work, and subsequently for about three hours constantly at home, the headset showed no sign of flagging.  I dutifully charged the battery overnight before using it, so your results may vary if you don't follow the setup instructions.  It took under an hour to bring the battery back to full off of my PC's USB port.SummaryWould I get this headset again or recommend it to friends?  Certainly!  Being free from cords is worth the slight drop in fidelity, and the comfort of the fit beats most over-the-ear headphones I've tried.  This headset has replaced my Apple earbuds for walks, yard work, and sitting around the house.  And it looks cool.  Did I mention that?

$REVIEW.: I am trying to be fair here by giving this projector four stars but I really wanted to give it three stars due to inferior image quality.  But then I remembered the price point for it so I stuck with four star.  In this era of Blu-Ray, plasma TV, 1080p, etc., it's hard to go back to lower image quality.  I'm seeing mosquito noise, pixelation, pixel grid lines, etc.  Initially, I actually thought I had a setting wrong -- that's how troubling the image quality was to my spoiled standards.  I also have an Epson projector that is about twice this cost of this guy, and it is amazing in image quality.  Despite my complaints about the image quality, I agree that it will be adequate for many and, indeed, the picture is very bright and colorful.Setting up the projector was a breeze as I had going in minutes using the quick setup guide. In reality though, I didn't need the guide since setup was so straight forward -- the physical buttons on the unit and the remote are well labelled and supplemented with helpful icons, for example. Getting the picture displayed properly has been a chore with other projectors but this guy has a wonderful elevator level underneath that can easily be raised and lowered. The product also feels and looks like a quality product -- sturdy and solid with seemingly no cheap or flimsy plastic parts.PROS====+ Bright picture+ Remote included (and doesn't require perfect aim at the device to respond!)+ Easy to use button and menus+ Integrated lens cover+ Instant off -- no delayed cool down process+ Excellent elevation lever on the bottom to get height just right+ Quiet fan+ Free "Extra Care" service where Epson ships you a replacement unit if your unit malfunctions (usually 2-days)CONS====+ Sub-standard image quality (mosquito noise, pixelization, grid lines, etc.)+ Menu could use a larger font (but it is still readable to me)+ No USB type A port and no included USB type B cable+ Built-in speakers at max volume hard to hear clearly when more than 10 feet away+ No wireless support+ No carrying case includedI recommend this projector only if you are on a tight budget, but if not, I believe you should dish out the extra dough and get a projector that has better image quality.

$review_text.: Fantastic purchase - just what I needed when my laptop wouldn't boot any more

I just hooked this up to the spare IDE slot on my desktop, powered up, and there was a new drive with all my files on it


The hardest thing about any of this was figuring out how to unscrew the drive out of the laptop chassis - they bolt those things in pretty well.

$review_text.: It is nice and small. That's about all it has going for it. The spacing of the keys is just weird. I was hoping to get a bit more practice with it, and get used to it.However, I recently found the guts of a Micro USB port still attached to one of my Micro USB cables, and I couldn't figure out what piece of hardware it belonged to. Eventually, I noticed that the missing port was from this device. I'm sending it back to Amazon. I've had it for about a week.

$review_text.: I've bought several of the AmazonBasics HDMI 1.4 cables for use at my office.  For a while, it seemed like every time I bought a spare, someone needed it right away, so it just made sense to start buying them in 2-packs.  The nice feature of the 2-pack cables is that each one has a colored ring around the end, so you know which one goes to each device.  Although this is meant to make it easier to identify which component you're plugging into your TV or receiver, it's also helpful with figuring out which monitor is plugged into each port on your computer in a multi-monitor computer setup.For more on the AmazonBasics HDMI cable and why you should buy the AmazonBasics cable over any other inexpensive brand, see my review of the individually-sold cable: [...]

$REVIEW.: In my quest for quality, I checked out friends cases, and I even asked people I didn't know about their case when I saw them using it at a coffee shop!  I am a frugal shopper but willing to pay for quality to get what I need.The features I was seeking were protection, light weight, and the vertical, horizontal abilities

 Deft Detour 360 fits the bill nicely and it looks great!Now this is customer service!!  The first case I received was flawed in appearance in the front flap and the "tray" that the iPad is supposed to lock into didn't quite capture the corner where the camera is, so I was concerned it would come loose


 I wrote Deft and I received a response THE NEXT DAY!!  They sent me a new case which I received a few days later and this one it working great!

$REVIEW.: Took an hour or so of getting used to

 The key was to finally let my hand rest on the tablet surface itself, which at first I was loath to do
After a while it becomes fairly natural


 Bamboo offers several little puzzels and games to learn the interface

 These are worth playing with for an hour or so.The real advantage is using the tablet for drawing/painting of course
It's fun to doodle, but drawing can be used to draw maps for routes, add simple illustrations, label/edit photos, diagram out processes...etc


 In other words, you don't have to be a gifted artist to make use of this


 I didn't find the 'download' software very helpful


 Soon I went out and bought Sketchbook Pro 6 for drawing and painting

Functions much better.

My drives work as though they are mounted just like normal.The only problem is that there generally isn't good airflow around a 5.25 bay, so a low-power green drive works best.  I was getting 33C temps with a green drive,and 46C temps with a 7200 drive, but my case is pretty much silent with low air flow.I did not attempt any hot-swapping, but that will be entirely dependent on your OS settings and hardware.

$review_text.: I added these Amp as part of my complete nose to tail Alpine System in my 2001 WS6 Trans Am.Alpine IDA-X305S Head unit, Alpine SPR-17S in the front doors, Alpine SPG-17C2 in the back seat area, Alpine SWR1043D Sub and originally Alpine PDX-5 - Amplifier - 4-channel plus Mono-power.The 4 75W Channels sound wonderful, the 320W was not enough for the big heavy duty Sub though...The 1043 asks for 600W, I figured seeing I don't boom my music and listen to rock that would be enough, but I was mistaken.The SPR-17s sound amazing, very nice clean highs and good mid bass. The SPG-17C2 are great for rear fill and sound quality as well. I was a bit disappointed on my bass.. most songs the 1043 Did not show up.. Installer said the 320 out was not enough for a high-end heavy duty sub like the 1043, I then ordered and installed along with the other amp a Alpine PDX1600 to drive my Sub..... and WOW did it wake the system up!I now have amazing clear highs, nice punchy Mid bass and very clean and clear low bass..awesome sound system, only thing I would have done different now, is get a 4Ch 100 or 150 amp to go with the mono 600 for my sub. I now have 75w 4Ch with an un-used 320 mono... it is not worth selling and changing it out to get an other 25W per Ch. So learn from my build, but I will say again... AMAZING sound, loud and crystal clear.If you are a Audiophile, you will be very pleased with these parts.I am a Very happy Camper.

It conveniently draws its operating power through the connecting cord to a netbook or laptop USB port.

I wish it had a single finger scrolling, if it does, I couldn't figure it out.Given the usability of it however, it's worth it.  It's light and easy to handle, the touchpad is very precise and the drivers work without installing any additional software (in windows at least).  If you are replacing a previous k400 keyboard I recommend removing the old drivers first though, otherwise, there is some sort of conflict and some of the functions don't work quite right.By the way, the model that was shipped was the updated k400r which as I understand it is better than the original.  yay!

At first, I assumed that the problem was in the prerecorded VHS tapes, however; the problem got worse with time and tapes recorded from broadcast television would experience the same problem.  Also note, the fast wind is rather slow and does not slow the tape near the end of the tape as do better VHS tape players.The DVD side worked very well both video and audio.

$REVIEW.: While my wife is not a fan of things pink, she likes this case. I chose the color and gifted this with her kindle. This is the first pink thing I have purchased for my wife outside of roses.The good:The top flips over, completely out of the way. This makes it easy to use either side buttons on the kindle to turn pages. While the leather is not super premium, it is more than durable enough to protect the kindle. The interior is smooth suede; soft. The sides extend slightly past the side of the kindle enough to provide a small amount of protection for any side impact. There are slots for credit cards, id, cash and stuff. The magnetic latch is strong and durable. rooCase did not go cheap on this latch. The kindle is held secure in the case. Overall, the stitching is done professionally; I do not think the stitching will fall apart. I have no issues with quality of construction. Buttons and ports are accessible. And finally, at $25, the price is reasonable.Could be better:It would be better if the leather is un-dyed. I would also rather not see all those credit card and money slots. This is a protective cover for the kindle and not a wallet. I would rather have smooth suede against the face of the kindle.p.s. I chose pink so her's would stand out, be feminine, and be easily spotted when she forgot where she left it.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this Amp thinking that it could be good amp for the money. I have a good experience in the past with Sound Storm amps. I have a 250 x 2 for the sub and that amp its been working non stop since 2003 almost 10 years. So I give them a try with this new amp. Surprise for me, the quality of this product drop a lot in the last 10 years. The amp as soon was installed started to transmit to the speakers every kind of engine noise, doesn't matter how good was the ground, either using the best RCA cables and power cables for the Amp, etc. I contacted Sound Storm and they said that I need to send the amp back to their service facility and I need to pay for the shipping on both ways because it is been more than 7 days since I purchase it (we are talking $40+ on shipping only for a amp that cost $49.99) I refuse to pay for the shipping because was a brand new amp and was ridiculous that they only pay for the shipping cost if you submit a claim before the fir 7 days, It took 10 days to received it since I place the order. After several weeks of emails going back and forward the customer service manager agree that they will cover the return shipping cost, but I need to pay for shipping cost to them ($25) I refuse to pay 50% of the cost of the amp on shipping cost for a defective item. I decide to not send the item and get stuck with a crappy amp. I purchase a sound insulator for the RCA cables ($10) each and installed them. Finally the noise was removed and the amp started working as it should. 2 month later my car started to show sign of poor battery charge, I figure out maybe the old battery was ready to go. I replace the battery for a new one and surprise 3 days later the car was with a dead battery. I found out that the amp remain on all the time even if the radio was turn off. I checked the remote cable and even with all the speaker cables disconnected and the remote, the amp remain on. I end up removing the + cable to shut it off.Conclusion I end up paying $70 for a really low quality amp and still does not worked properly, if you are looking for low cost amp go with another brand like Crunch, Sony, JVC, etc. If you are looking for a good quality amp stick with big name like Alpine, Pioneer, etc.Sound Storm customer service it is really bad as the quality of their product. So stay away from this brand.

$REVIEW.: This is a very nice speaker, producing rich tones from your digital music.Like many speakers, it will also charge your iPod or iPhone, but the real difference maker is the Airplay technology, so that it can play music off a computer's iTunes, iPad, or iPod through a wireless network.When an iPod is placed on the charging tray, the remote control allows you to change songs and volume easily, and the remote is small so it takes up little space.One thing to be aware of is that older iPods may not work.  I tried an older wheel-based iPod (5th Gen) and it is not compatible, although an iPod classic is supposed to be.  Before you put down money, make sure your iPod is compatible, or else you will end up plugging it into the Input jack, which works great, but won't charge the MP3 player or allow use of the remote.All told this is a VERY nice speaker dock, and it will provide you with great sound.
$SUMMARY.: Beautiful Sound

$review_text.: Just a perfect television at a very reasonable price

I paid $229 on Prime and got it in less than two days

I bought this for my garage and it has been on almost constantly for half a year and works just great


The unit is light and has simple connections and takes garage abuse
Picture is perfect and sound is strong enough to be heard over noisy, beer consuming friends.

$REVIEW.: First and foremost the Sony NWZ-E354 has done everything I ever need a MP3 player to do and at a vary good price, good bang for the buck

Oh right it doesn't have speakers,well buy the next model up then
The screen scratchs to easily then buy a player with a Gorilla glass screen if you can't protect it, let me know what that costs

The one I bought is blue, happened to be on sale at that time
Color not a big issue price is
I also bought the Tuff-Luv Apocalypes case it does a good job of protecting the players screen without looking through plastic
I think the sound quality is excellent in part due to the ability of the players equalizer to customize the sound and save it to pre-sets for the earphones of your choice


I have several pairs of earbuds and they all have different sound characteristics

The players video is pretty good considering its size,I use to have a non-HD Zune player and the video doesn't look that much different, just smaller

The control interface is a little clunky, but when you get use to it it's not so bad

To bad there isn't a customizable short-cut key

I like the separate volume buttons on the side


The bottom line is I bought this player for music, excellent job in that department

Secondary to occasionally watch some videos or view pictures good enough


The size is great not to small to loose, but not to big for any pocket I want to put it in

All this and no special software or site, oh it does have a iTunes content transfer program if needed.

$REVIEW.: This is my very first Plasma, but I can confidently say that this far surprasses my last TV in both size and picture quality.  (The tv this replaced was a 32" VIZIO LCD in a pretty Java color...I loved it while I owned it, but that is a thing of the past now. Anyway, onward to the actual review...)The TV is Really slim, more so than I expected.  Although that's on me for not checking the dimensions of the TV itself. Not to mention it's absurdly light too.  It was very easy to mount to my wall as well.The mount that was used is here below[...]Now this is where I have a small complaint:Since I am using the wallmount provided above with this plasma, it is rather close to the wall.  The reason this is a problem is because the HDMI cables I'm using plug in directly behind the tv perpendicularly, therefore bending them at rather extremely.  This also means I cannot tilt my tv as far downward as the mount would allow, or that would mean the weight of the whole TV is resting on everything you have plugged into it. My suggestion to you viewers who may consider this tv (and want to wall mount it,) is to get a compatible swivel mount so that at least you can pull the TV outward away from the wall, giving your HDMI cables (maybe more) some slack to move around.  This issue is the ONLY reason why I took out one star from my review on this item, as it is a design flaw.  Performance-wise, this tv has no flaws.7/29/11 - Day 1:I hooked my Viera to my PS3 PC and DVR, and so far everything seems to be running fine, no dead or stuck pixels whatsoever. The standard video setting looked terrible, so I tweaked the contrast and brightness as well as other settings to my liking.  If you want to keep things simple, you can easily switch to "Cinema," as that would be my favorite preset for multimedia viewing.  I used Rattatouile as a movie test and there was no problem at all.At the moment I did not plug in an ethernet cable or wireless adapter, so I have yet to check out any of the online tv features that this model has to offer.  I'll update this portion of the review if I do...I read on yahoo-answers that setting the label for certain inputs to "GAME" as opposed to "CINEMA" or "BLU-RAY", the TV will switch to game-mode for much faster response-time.  I tested that with MW2 and Uncharted 2, and I haven't had any lag problems.Well there's not much more to talk about this TV other than the fact that the price you pay for this tv here is unbeatable, especially for a reputable brand like Panasonic---These guys dont fool around.  I will update about a month from now to update if anything goes better or worse. Hah, that's if I remember...Cheers.

$REVIEW.: This screen protector is precise, fits perfectly, and was easy to install.I've only ever used ZAGG Invisible Shields and a couple of those matte, dry install type protectors from back in the early day on my devices. In my experience, the ZAGG product is excellent, and very similar to this one, so my review will somewhat focus on comparing the two.This time around, for my new Nexus 7 I decided to try a new screen protector product and am glad I did. I'll choose an ArmorSuit MilitaryShield over ZAGG again in the future because of the precise fit and truly transparent install (no &#34;orange peel&#34; effect at all). The protector is also less grippy or tacky than an Invisible Shield - which is either a positive or a negative depending upon your preference. In fact, I would say on a scale of 1-10, with bare glass being&#34;0&#34;, this protector adds about a &#34;1.5&#34; worth of tackiness while an InvisibleShield adds about a &#34;5&#34;.This protector fits so well, is so transparent, and is so smooth you wouldn't even notice it if you didn't know it was there. Highly recommended for anyone who doesn't need much extra grip for their device screen.

$REVIEW.: In an effort to reduce coffee table clutter, I decided to buy a Logitech remote.  Money was an issue, so I chose the 650 model.  I am a Mac user, and the Logitech interface for setting up the remote is one of the most lethargic applications I have ever used.  If you are a Mac user, be sure to use Firefox as your browser, or you will not have much success in the setup process (even tried to use Safari in IE mode).  The time to add four devices to the remote came in at just under one hour.  The Logitech interface "kicked me out" three times during the setup process.  I am not a tech wizard, but I do know my way around a computer, and I give the setup application one star.  Once the remote was finally set up, I tested it on the four devices (TV, DVD, A/V receiver, DirecTV) each one powered off and on, and the controls seem to work wonderfully.  I then tried the "Watch TV" button, and the appropriate devices powered on and were set to the correct inputs.  Then I tried the "Watch a movie" button and the TV and A/V powered off, and the DVD came on.  So you have to have all the components off to have the buttons function correctly.  I have had to reset the remote frequently, because the power off function doesn't always work properly.  Overall, it is a nice remote that performs its duties reasonably.

$REVIEW.: This product has a serious design flaw. The "Micro SATA Cables -mSATA to SATA Adapter" has a SATA connector that is flipped over (180 degrees) from where it should be. This prevents their adapter from fitting inside my external disk drive enclosure. The wrong side of the flat SATA connector is flush with the flat back of the card it is mounted on.  ASIN: B004YKJ5TE Item model number: MSATA-ADPT.  If you compare the orientation of the SATA connector with that of a small SATA hard disk drive, you will see that the SATA connector is upside down from where it needs to be.

Netflix, Pandora, Amazon Player, all work great after a few minutes of set up.My one BIG complaint and hopefully this will be fixed in the near future, is that the Sony Sideview app does not work with iOS devices at all.  I called Sony and they admitted as much, saying it will only work with Android devices.  If that's the case, fine, but then do not ADVERTISE that it WILL work with Apple iPhone.  Huge waste of time messing around with the app trying to get it to work.  This is why I am giving this player three stars instead of five.It's competitive out there.  Don't add FALSE advertising to the characteristics I associate with the SONY brand.  You are better than that.

$REVIEW.: Having read the fine reviews of Seagate hard drives, I didn't expect any problems with a brand new in-the-package external 160GB Seagate HD bought on E-bay earlier this year.  I too have been using Acomdata external HD's for the last few years with no problems. In contrast, this Seagate 160GB worked initially, lay unused for a few months, then after less than two hours use.....it corrupted all the data placed on it, apparently because it didn't disconnect from my computer after I dragged the icon to the trash on my Apple Dual G4. Even after the icon vanished and the hard drive seemed disconnected, when I shut it off, the computer screen said the disconnection had not been done properly.  All efforts to open the files thereafter resulted in a message on screen saying the Apple 10x couldn't recognize the files. Not until I erased the whole 2 hours of loaded data did the HD start to fly right again.The HD was intended as back-up for my computer's internal HD's--but not after this.  One silly little disconnect mistake and the whole huge file is corrupted.  If it continues to work, I'll use it as a data transfer HD and be very patient and gingerly about closing it from any computer.  Have another external 120GB Seagate which filled in for the failed one--but I  haven't the faith in it I did when I bought it. Seagate HD's seem to take an especially long time posting an icon to a computer screen (and leaving one also, apparently)--my old trusty Acomdata HD's pop right on and right off, even shutting down before I turn off the power.Suspect the internal Seagate HD's are a better device and have now invested in an external enclosure.
$SUMMARY.: Disappointed in this external 160GB Seagate HD

Inside the case the pocket above where the laptop goes (where there is a strap to hold the laptop in place) is just that: one big pocket. Outside the case you unzip it, & there is the area for large things along with a few smaller pockets for small items like maybe a cell phone, flash drive case, etc. There are also 2 loops to place pens. Overall I find the price reasonable & I am happy with my purchase. The case also arrived on time.

You will go through black cartridges more often than you go through clean socks.  The wireless functionality is miserable, it often needs 10 minutes of just being powered on, before any communication will work.  The scanning functionality is terrible and cant even scan a ful 8x11 page.  Every single aspect of this thing sucks and how it made it to market with what seems like a complete lack of QA and RD is astonishing.

$REVIEW.: The camera is small, but not too small for an adult to hold and operate with one hand, although two hands are better.  The best part about this small camera is that it has a 10:1 zoom, which no other small camera has at this time.  As with most small cameras, there is a delay between snapping the shutter and the actual shutter movement.  For faster moving objects, that might mean you aren't going to get a picture of what you thought you were going to get.  There may be a way to avoid that, but I haven't had the time to read the manual.  The camera's 6 megapixel capacity is more than adequate for this type of camera.  Anyone needing more that 6 megapixels should be using a single lense reflex digital camera instead of this type of camera.  The only minor annoyance I have encountered so far is that the zoom is hard to control.  It takes a few "ins and outs" to finally compose the photo that you really want.  I guess that I am used to using a zoom lense on a single lense reflex camera, where I can really get what I want more quickly.  Picture quality seems to be very good, although the flash doesn't go too far out.

Sometimes the voice on the GPS seems to be a little confused about what to say next, and it begins a direction and abruptly changes or stops, but this has not happened much. The only complaint that I have with this product, is that when I ordered the updated "maps" for it from Magellan, I was told that I would be charged $10 and my account was charged $20.  I called Magellan and spoke with reps that told me that my $10 would be refunded, but this has been over a year ago, and I still have not received my refund. I was a little disappointed about that.

For software whose name has become the equivalent of the word &#34;edit,&#34; much like Google has for &#34;search,&#34; it's hard to compete with


But Corel is a worthy contender, and at a better price too.For someone like me who is not a photography guru or editing expert, Corel is great

Suite X7 has everything you need, whether you're an advanced user or a novice like myself


It has many of the same tools that other editing software have, and I won't even use half of them
I like the interface, but there is a learning curve to be expected with the applications (Corel Draw, Corel Capture, ConceptShare, just to name a few)

I have found the tutorials to be very, very helpful
Use them and educate yourself.So if you're looking for a good price for a package that can do just about anything, Corel is a great choice.

$review_text.: This case really has serious identity issues.  Otterbox has a Commuter line of products, offering less protection than the Defender but is typically lighter and less bulky.  The Defender line of products is known for full protection at the cost of some added bulk and weight.  This product carries the Defender name, but clearly provides protection of their Commuter line.  If Otterbox wanted to put out just one case for the ipad 2, they should have labeled this thing properly.I'm not thrilled with the case, but will be keeping it only because it's most protective case for the iPad 2 available.  I've been an owner of the first iPad Defender for 9 months, so here are key positive/negative, and some other points:+ The cover.  It's much easier to prop open with one hand.  There are two viewing angles, one perfect for typing which my protractor measures at 20 degrees.  Flip the cover around and the other angle is for viewing movies, etc, which measures at 60 degrees.  The cover hinge no longer falls down when you remove the ipad, compared to the previous defender.+ The volume, sleep, and home buttons are much easier to press when compared to the first defender.  There is also noticeably less of a "click" sound when you press the home and volume buttons.+ The few ounces they managed to remove makes it easier to hold.- The cover.  While being the greatest improvement, this is ironically the biggest disappointment.  Each of the four corners of the front bezel are exposed when the cover is on the front of the ipad.  It's clear that they did this either so that people could show off their silly white version of the ipad, to shave off some ounces from the product, and/or that the rear camera is always exposed when you put the cover onto the rear of the ipad.  We all know the rear camera is garbage, so this was a pretty bad decision, likely made by somebody with too much authority at the company.Still worse, when you place the cover on the front of the iPad, it actually pushes the home button.  If you have this thing stored in a bookbag or backpack, the cover will actually cause the home button to be pressed/held, killing some battery every time it activates.  Did nobody test this thing?  I'm seriously doubting the team that came up with this idea for this cover even uses an ipad.  Hopefully they can put out a revised cover that actually covers the entire front.- The bezel protection.  The entire bezel isn't protected as in the original ipad.  I assume they did this so that people can show off their white ipad, and to shave off an ounce or two from the weight, but it undermines the purpose of the defender.- The speaker is exposed.  I don't know how they could have gotten around this though, since the ipad 2 uses a grill VS the first ipad that had 3 large holes.  The first defender simply put rubber around that area with 3 holes for the speaker.iPad 1 with original defender and cover: 2 pounds 13.1 oziPad 2 with new defender and cover: 2 pounds 5.2 oz(Note that the iPad 2 is already 4 ounces lighter than the iPad 1, so the iPad 2 Defender case is only 3.9 ounces lighter than the iPad 1 Defender case)When you put the rear cover on the ipad 2 and lay the device down on a table, it's ironically only about 1mm shorter than the original ipad with its cover in the same position.Somebody mentioned being able to fit a quarter between the ipad 2 bezel and the hard case, or the dock cover not seating properly.  If this is happening, then you didn't snap the two hard plastic pieces together properly when assembling the case, or didn't push the silicone into all of the gaps properly.Somebody also mentioned that the headphone jack puckered at first when trying to close that part of the case.  It doesn't snap into place as easily as the rotate/mute cover does, for example.  However, if you pinch the headphone cover and then insert, it's a little easier to close.They only shaved off 3.9 ounces compared to the original iPad Defender case, and at great expense of protection.  It's not what I'm used to with the Defender line, but this is sadly the best ipad 2 protection currently available.

$review_text.: OK, I have my NSZ-GS7 Sony Google TV box, Xbox 360, HDMI to Micro HDMI cable for Nexus 10 mirroring, all plugged into the splitter. I can have my Google box running at ALL times and if I start the Xbox or Nexus 10 cable the splitter recognizes and jumps to the new input. This is great that I DO NOT have to power down the Google TV box. Some other brands will not allow a jump if there is something running to the splitter.  In other words, only one powered up device  at a time. The Portta allows multiple. The 3X1 splitter has done a great job for what I thought I wasn't going to be able to do. Example: if I shut off my Xbox it just goes right back to my TV (COX CABLE WITH SONY NSZ GS7) which is still powered on. If I turn on my Xbox it jumps to that. If I plug my Nexus 10 in it will automatically jump to that without having to power down the GTV.

$REVIEW.: I have used a couple of types of Velcro cable ties in the past.  The best ones have hooks all along one side and fuzz all along the other with  a slot in the top, so you can loop it around the cable at one end so it stays attached even when the cable is unwrapped.  These have hooks only on about an inch or two at one end of the tie.  You have to wrap it carefully (and not particularly tightly) around the cable bunch until you get to then end with the hooks.  If you unwrap the cable the tie falls off.  These a just considerably more annoying to use than the type I first described.  One other review mentioned these work best in more permanent installations where you aren't going to be undoing them regularly.  True, but plastic zip ties and twist ties also work for this at a fraction of the cost.

$review_text.: My first order was through Amamax and I got four rolls of velcro tie strap which goes for three times the price thatthe 3.5mm cables go for, soooo, after a fashion, I figured out that I should just keep my mouth shut and order thecables again as I did have a need for some good velcro tie strap (which this is).I did send a comment to Amamax and got an answer after a couple of days saying: 'Got your email, can't figure outwhat the problem is, so what's up?' I am amazed he did not add the word "Dude" at the end.Anyway, after this message I figured they had it coming; kinda like the teller that tells you that you are wrong and that she/he made the correct change even when you step out of the store $10.00 richer. (They have it coming)Dude!Back to the cables!They are good cables that when shoved in and out to many times will wear and start to wiggle and you will have toreach for one of the other ones you ordered as back up (you did order one for back up didn't you?)These are cheap 2 dollar cables and they do the job asked of them for a long time if not constantly yanked in and out.Oh yea, the second supplier (BTO) was very fast, and I got the product I ordered.

$REVIEW.: First a quick description, at least of how I use it

The control unit is connected between my (FiOS) set top box and my home theater receiver

There is a difficult but not hard (numerous steps, each of which is doable) setup process to configure it for my home network, set top box, receiver, and monitor

(Leave yourself an hour and don't do it right before you need to watch anything "important".)  Once I did that I was able to use the remote provided to control pretty much everything
(It has all the most used functions but not esoteric stuff like, for example turning on my monitor 3-D viewing modes.)The real value, beyond having a single, integrated remote comes when I step away for my cable provider
The Sony player comes with Google TV, Netflix, and Amazon video on demand built in


Once I enter my account information for Google and the two streaming providers


I can also get access to dozens of other streaming providers if I care to.Now to the nice features...When I do a content search the Sony player returns results for all the services that are active
In my case, for example, if I am searching for a particular episode of "My Little Pony" then I'll get clickable links into whichever service(s), googleTV, Netflix, or Amazon it is available
It also shows me which would require me to pay to view.The remote is well designed

One side is a "standard" remote with a four direction pad, a touch pad, and dedicated media buttons like fast forward, pause, and play


The other side is a keypad that has a nice backlight and good feedback


Along the edge there are controls for channel up/down,  volume up/down, and mute.With this nice keypad and the available picture-in-picture I can take a moment to surf the internets :) , check my email, post to Facebook, etc without missing a (hoof) beat of the show I'm watching.So, what does this to that it is so good at doing, you ask?  I see it as a consolidation device that not only provides a (nearly) universal remote but also an efficient presentation of media provided by my cable provider, a number of streaming services, and the Internet.

$REVIEW.: I recently purchased a pair of Shure  SE215's. They have an awesome sound but I could not get a proper sealwith the included buds. I even tried the Comply buds, but even they would not seal properly for me. My Shures did not include these sleeves so I thought I'd buy a set to give them a try.  I thought they were a bust at first, extremely uncomfortable. I tried clipping the top flange off and this made them perfect. The seal never breaks and I can lay on my side in comfort while in bed. I also get the best sound isolation with these sleeves. All in all I am a happy camper.

$review_text.: These are entry-level earbuds.  They're OK for the price, but not great.Here's what I use mine for:  PC speakers on a workplace system bug me.  I don't want to hear "bing-bong" every time the guy in the next cubicle gets and email and I don't want him to have to hear my sounds whenever I visit a website with sounds turned on.  So I have a cheap set of earbuds plugged into my PC and leave them on my desk.  If there's something I want to hear, then I put them on.  Otherwise, my system never makes a peep.These earbuds are perfect for a use like that where sound fidelity is a low priority.I would also recommend these for handheld games.  My son uses earbuds like these when he plays his Nintendo DS.  These earbuds even come with a decent carrying pouch with a keyfob ring, so you could actually attach the pouch to the DS and always have the earbuds at hand.If sound is critical, keep shopping.  If you just want to hear basic audio and don't want to spend much, then these are the ones for you.UPDATE:  (8/12/10)The price of these earbuds keeps bouncing up and down.  Today's $24.99 price is a pretty poor value.  They were priced lower when I wrote this review.  I wouldn't have been so kind if they were priced as high as they are today.

$review_text.: Overall, I like the Moshi PalmGuard, but I think based on its not-so-cheap-for-a-piece-of-plastic status, it could use some work.  Application was fairly easy, however I found that the strip above the trackpad when installing it from the bottom up (as they suggest) got a bit of a buckle in it. I was able to adjust it carefully and get it to adhere, but it did come up one more time an hour later. Once this is in place, I'd suggest really pushing hard all around to ensure proper adhesion. Much easier to install than a screen protector though, that's for sure.The trackpad protector works well, and allows all finger gestures, but I'd like it to be a smoother texture. It's not quite as silky smooth as the uncovered surface, and takes a little getting used to. The other problem I noticed, and honestly just wasn't prepared for due to the nature of the palmrest cover, was the presence of air bubbles. So word to the wise: imagine the trackpad cover is a screen protector and really try carefully to avoid trapping air. I'll give this a little more time, but the trackpad cover may have to come off soon. I'd rather have paid less for the palmrest cover and not had the trackpad cover bundled with it.UPDATE: Within hours of posting this, of course the band running along the top of the trackpad is now perpetually buckling up and not adhering properly. The surface was prepared before application to get rid of any grease or dust, but this thing is just not adhering properly in that area, especially when the battery is charging and the surface becomes warm. I have contacted Moshi's customer service, so hopefully they address this problem soon.UPDATE 2: This is a long overdue update, but Moshi got right back to me and sent out a new guard. The new one adhered PERFECTLY and has been on for over a year now. I don't even notice that it's there and I know it's done a good job of limiting wear and tear on the trackpad and palm rest area. Great product.

$REVIEW.: *(Please rate this review if you found it helpful)*EDIT: After 2 months of having this subwoofer, I have concluded that this is an amazing deal for the money! The sounds blends in perfectly with my Infinity Primus series of tower and bookshelf speakers.  Luckily my receiver has the Odyssey EQ setup so it perfectly blended the subwoofers volume into my system.  Something else i found interesting is that the black wooden finish on the outside matches perfectly with the Infinity speakers! Other than the small logo, you can't tell that it's a different brand.  As for the topic that is not always discussed, ambient lighting in a home theatre is a buzz kill.  There is a small green light on the back of this subwoofer but it does not provide enough light to be noticed even in a completely pitch black room.Overall, you cannot go wrong with this subwoofer and i can't recommend this any more highly.Here is my original review:Review:  First of all, this is a ridiculous sale! $180 for a 12 inch sub is awesome! it sounds great and you can tell by the weight of the speaker (about 45 lbs) that this thing is a tankPros:Very heavy and sturdygreat soundeasy to follow setup/instructionsblack wood matches many other speakersvery very very DEEP bass (i actually had to turn it down to about 40% of full volume to avoid making the  dog bark)Cons:Mine first speaker came with a COMPLETELY shattered grill but amazon promptly replaced it free of chargeOverall, this was a great purchase and i look forward to using it in the future.

$REVIEW.: I was using a clear screen protector and gummy perimeter surround case on my iPod but wanted more protection. This case appeared to be a great solution, and for the most part it is.The blue contrast stitching on the black leather is impeccably sewn - perfectly aligned, not a stitch out of place. The blue color, although bright, is not garish and perfect for either a man or woman. The Velcro closure is small and somewhat sunken into the back panel so when closed it creates very little excess thickness. The case has a slim profile in part because there is no belt loop.Details reflect the effort that went into the design process which is largely well thought out. There is an opening for everything requiring one, and I don't have a problem with folding the front cover over to snap a picture, but then I only use my iPod occasionally for photos.I do have a problem with the back of the case leaving all four corners of the iPod exposed. I am posting two photos because the other shots on the product page don't clearly show the problem. The primary reason I wanted the case was to better protect the device, so I am not completely satisfied.And, in a failed experiment, I attempted to squeeze the iPod, in its gummy case, into the Belkin folio so all four corners would be covered, but no amount of manipulation would permit the merger. The case is attractive, well made and almost perfect for my use.

You will like them, provided that your space is limited and you don't need high volumes or a lot of bass.That said, don't expect audiophile quality.  On the plus side, the electronics, 2.5 inch drivers, and power supply brick do seem first rate.  The midrange meets or exceeds realistic expectations for this price range, particularly at lower volumes.  But the enclosures and tweeters seem awfully flimsy and cheap for a product bearing the Klipsch name.  The overall sound deteriorates markedly before truly loud volumes are reached.  The high end lacks openness; brushed cymbals don't hang in the air at any volume.Update 9/19/2007:The above was written during February 2005.  Obviously, I liked these speakers while they were working properly.My Klipsch's began to fail two years later and were completely dead by July 2007.  The problem was the same as others have documented:  the volume control gradually became more and more noisy until the sound was gone.The "low" price I paid no longer seems so low.  Is anyone else getting tired of cheaply made Chinese goods that have to be continually repurchased?  Or of once-proud American companies that no longer have anything to do with the products that bear their name?

$review_text.: I've bought the wrong wire for my macbook twice (to dual screen). Your macbook output is a "mini displayport." I was so confused, and spent $12 trying to find the right wire. I gave this three stars because I haven't tested it and 3 is average. The product feels flimsy and feels like it can break fast. Although the product was not late, it came after a long time. I was very angry when I found out this was not compatible for my macbook, I had to go to a retail store outside and get a wire... So check your ports and make sure you get the right wire before buying!
$SUMMARY.: Do not buy this if you use a macbook

 It won't stay in place on the arm of my chair at all

$review_text.: Okay, I know all about the issues with this and similar Onkyo models, you probably do too. However it seems that Onkyo has corrected the firmware problems for most users. I do not have the &#34;clicking&#34; upon sound mode change reported by Keely below, in fact my 515 does not change sound mode when changing channels or FF'ing. That may be an issue with that person's DVR. Even when my 515 does change from Dolby to 2 channel it does not click.If you don't know, there were some issues that seem to all be corrected with the October firmware update release. I hesitated to write a review right away since I wanted to see if mine would hold up during the 30 day return period. But since some people are still reporting problems with this unit I wanted to go ahead and write this. I will update it if things change, but.....Listen. If you have problems with this unit or updating the firmware, simply CALL ONKYO! They give you a toll-free 24/7 800 number to call and get help, which I have done and they are extremely nice and helpful. I'm confident any problem you have can be solved, but give it a chance. If I am proven wrong I WILL update this review.Okay now on to the review. This receiver is simply an incredible value and has tons of features and functions for a small price. I see that they are going up in price since I bought mine a few weeks ago, probably because the firmware issue was resolved so get yours before they go up more!The features are just great. Tons of connectivity, apps for Internet radio built in, powered Zone 2 (the main feature I needed), and plenty of power. I paired this unit with JBL CS-480 5.1 surround speakers (see my review) and couldn't be happier with the sound quality. Extremely loud, clear, full and rich after using the included room correction routine. The Onkyo remote app for ipad is nice, but I'm anxious to get the $5 O-remote app which gives you the full remote on your ipad. Can't wait till next summer to sit on my deck and change channels and volume of my Zone 2 deck speakers with my ipad! The functions and features of this unit, for the price, is simly amazing.But you know all that. You're looking at this unit because it has all the features you want for $100 less than the other brands. That's why I bought it. Yes, I was concerned about the HDMI out and other issues. And that happened to me, until I successfully installed the latest firmware with help from Onkyo support. Now my 515 works perfectly and I could not be more pleased with my choice.Again, as others have said, read the latest reviews. Go to Onkyo's support Forum and you'll see that the fever over the HDMI issue has died down since the October firmware release. I believe this is now an excellent choice and I will update this review if need be..... maybe to give it even more props!!
$review_summary.: Simply incredible product now that new firmware is out!

$REVIEW.: I looked at a handful of cases and read a lot of reviews for this case, but I had a much worse experience with it than I thought.Pros:Decent lookingThe front cover is large enough to cover the whole screenCovers the backConsRuberized texture shows fingerprints after less than an hour of use.The magnets in the screen cover are not strong enough to hold the cover down.Cover doesn't sit flush on the screen since the magnets aren't strong enough.Cover easily falls off the screen since the magnets don't hold it.This is one I didn't see elsewhere... there's hardly anywhere to put your fingers in to pull the cover back! you have to either slide the screen cover on the glass or flip the ipad upside down so the weak magnets will let go.I will be paying the return shipping if I have to return this.

$review_text.: I got this because my cord that came with my Ipad was fraying at the plug in to pad itself. The cord is great and the price was certainly better than the Apple store, even with postage. It works great and I think better and faster than my old cord. So I may have been right about the frayed part slowing down the charging process. At any rate it is a good buy and the folks that sent it were timely too.

$REVIEW.: I didn't want a cover or skin for my kindle touch because I like to use it as is ("naked" they say).  I wanted some kind of sleeve so that I could keep it from collecting dust when I wasn't using it and so that I could put it in my bag and take it with me.  This sleeve seemed like the best option for me.  The kindle touch fits very snugly inside this sleeve, and while it does take a bit of force to get it in and out, the snugness ensures that the kindle won't fall out.Overall, I am impressed at how soft the inside of this sleeve is, and I really like the "vine" design.  I expected the "BUILT" logo to be sewn on, but it is just the iron on plastic letters.  I thought the sleeve was a bit expensive considering how small it is, but besides the iron on letters the case seems to be well made and of good quality.  I would recommend this product to anyone wanting a sleeve for their kindle.  One thing to keep in mind is that there are no additional storage pockets and not a lot of additional room in the sleeve to put anything else, if that is important to you!

$REVIEW.: I own numerous USB Flash Drives, and although most of them still work okay, I find myself buying a new one every year or so since they keep getting bigger and cheaper


This Kingston 16GB model is a great value, and I like the retractable feature as opposed to worrying about using a cap

The device works perfectly right out of the box, and you can start using it immediately
The amount of data storage is great considering the amount of photos, videos, and music people have these days
I use this one to not only keep a portable copy of my music, but also to keep a few applications and documents I may need on other computers.Bottom Line: Great device that offers lots of storage, it's easy to use, works right out of the box, and is a great value for the money.

Then you can increase it from your iPhone). It's super light weight and ergonomically designed for active users. It does not get in the way when using it. I also love that it's wireless.

$REVIEW.: This iphone clock radio docking station is almost perfect for my needs:Pros:  Seems very sturdily built; reasonably priced compared to many similar docking stations; a relatively small footprint for sitting on a night table; red clock numbers that are bright enough day or night (can be dimmed a bit) but do not spread light throughout the room at night; decent radio sound; charges iphone quickly; I could actually figure out how to set the alarms; clock synced with iphone instantly; did not have to download any apps for this to work; wake to radio/idevice/buzzer; and most importantly, I can dock my iphone without removing my Otterbox (I had already sliced off the Otterbox rubber-like charger cover because it was a pain so I can't attest to how it would doc without cutting this off); has clock battery back up for power outages.Cons:  The bar that backs the iphone when docked is ugly; I don't especially like the semi-circle shape of the radio but this is very personal; although I could figure out how to set alarms (not so on some other docking stations), it did take some time and practice--I am not especially technical; the buttons, etc. are not all intuitive for the truly non-tech person.  Who knew that "standby" is an on/off button; not a great users manual but at least it is not painfully long; battery back-up just retains clock time in the event of a power outage- radio and alarm won't work until power comes back (but this is probably the industry standard);  and the con that bothers me the most--the alarm (from whatever source) starts very softly but very quickly, like a few seconds, gets blaringly loud. Don't try to lie there five minutes or even one minute listening to the music without first hitting some button.For me, the pros definitely outweigh the cons.

$REVIEW.: Garmin still makes a very poor in-car power adapter, the one in the 360 failed after only four months. I spliced in one from a Motorola (one piece as opposed to the Garmin multi-piece apprach) so no more problems. As numerous reviewers note the routing has bizarre habits of turing on and off major highways. That happens in the US, Germany, France, UK, Italy and Slovenia. Bad thinking, and sometimes a major hassle. In spite of that this is still a very good unit, but with saved routes eliminated, the routing problem recurs every trip. I have upgraded, although still to another Garmin. Will the 670 have the same problems? I hope not.

$REVIEW.: We had been searching for some time for a router that had advanced DHCP control features and could access the Internet by Cellular, Ethernet or even another router's WIFI.  We kept finding devices that did some of these functions but not all of them.  Or if they had some of these features they lacked the necessary router features that controlled IP address assignments.  And only after we had used this CradlePoint for a few weeks did we discover even more of the features such as &#34;WIFI as WAN&#34;.  Our traveling sales team was having to operate their equipment using 2 routers and two networks to demonstrate the  features of our application but this CradlePoint device has simplified that down to one network.  I cannot say enough good about this device.  It can reach the internet through my cell phone, through a customer's WIFI or through Ethernet - all with simply configuration procedures.

$REVIEW.: I just got this yesterday and I'm still building the music for it.  I have not determined if it holds a charge or recharges well or that sort of thing. However, using the very detailed description of a previous review, I did some testing and I'm writing the review based on his.  I have changed it where appropriate to fit my situation.Biggest "Cons" to this device1. No paperwork/instructions whatsoever!2. No way to tell when it is fully charged.3. No plastic storage box as promised in the description.Common sense says to charge it first.  You can charge it with or without a memory card plugged in.  I had no problems using a High Speed USB port (USB3).  Nor did I have any problems with my Vista machine recognizing it.  However, with both Vista and Windows 7, an error message was received when I tried to 'eject' the device with a memory card plugged in.  It did remove the drive from the list and the card seems unaffected.THINGS THAT I HAVE LEARNED:1. The USB cable must be pushed all the way in for it to charge or transfer files.2. It should work in both USB2 and USB3 ports.  Some have obviously had problems with USB3 ports.3. There is no way to tell when the device is fully charged.  From the description, a charge should last from 3 - 4 hours but there is no indication on how long it takes to charge.4. When the device is plugged into your computer, your speakers may not work.  They didn't for me on either my Vista or Windows 7 machine.5. The earbuds that are included may be uncomfortable. If so, substitute other earbuds or, even better, headphones!4. You can not insert headphones or earbud while the USB cable is plugged in.5. Edited Change (August 2013). You CAN charge with the plug adapter for USB cables (such as the one for Amazon kindle).  Even with the power off (as it should be), the red power light blinks just as it does while playing or while writing to the chip while it is in the device.6. You should turn the unit OFF when recharging.7. For Windows 7 or Vista users, it is easier and much faster to move files to the Micro SD card using an adapter and not using the USB cable supplied. Simply insert the Micro SD into the player and play your music.7. The Music will be played in the order it has been written, by folders.  For Vista and Windows 7, if you copy a group of files, it always copies the LAST item in the list first and then the rest of the list in alpha-numeric order.  If it is important that your last item in the list BE last, then rename the first file to force to the bottom of the list and then make your selection.8. It does recognize folders and can be used to group your music.  It works like the root level, the folders will be found in the order they are created and then the music within thim in the order wirtten.9. There is no screen, it simply plays MP3s in the order it it finds it. Use the forward and backward to skip in the appropriate direction.  There is no shuffle.10. The player is light weight (and such a pretty purple), which makes it easy to carry around.11. For a variety of music, simply use multiple Micro SD cards, each with a different style/kind of music.12. The device remembers where it left off.  When you turn it on, it starts at the beginning of the song it was playhing when you turned it off.  If not at a song, then the next song in the "list".Edited note -- August 2013.No battery life was given when I bought this device.  A check shows, at least for me, that the battery lasts less than 2 hours!  And that was after charging for 13 hours!

$REVIEW.: When I received this HDD, I could not believe my eyes. It is a beautiful, aesthetically extremely pleasing drive: The ruby red, slender drive with  mirror look, dark chrome sides and the jet black docking station lights up in a star light fashion when it is turned on, absolutely gorgeous! What a treat, I am proud to display this drive to everyone, just for the looks! It can be used without the docking station, of course. The docking station has a double usb cable, I assume to give more power, but this may be a problem if you're short of slots. I have not tried running the drive with only one usb plug. Of course the drive is also extremely easy to set up and use, a cinch. The manual (on the drive) is very easy to use and understand,even for a non techie such as myself. I have not yet used the included film making software but noted the extra software (optional) takes up a lot of hard drive space on my already cramped laptop. The drive comes with a 5 year limited warranty, another thing I really like. I am very satisfied with my purchase, but I paid only around $100 for the whole package, so it may be worthwhile to wait for a sale that includes the docking station for around $100.

$review_text.: I am using this in conjunction with anASROCK Z87E-ITX - LGA1150 Intel Z87 Chipset DDR3 SATA3 USB3.0 WiFi Mini-ITX Motherboardand the performance is great. This processor is literally at the low end of i3 processors listed as compatible for that board, but this gives me far more power than I need for the HTPC I'm using it in.Back when Windows 7 was in beta, I bought a new MB with advanced features that weren't supported in older versions of Windows. So I needed a new processor at the time and went with aIntel Core 2 Quad Q8400 Processor, which was far from low end. It was 75% more expensive than what this one costs now and this one outperforms it. While this is still a lower end processor, the fact that it can outperform a processor from a few years ago, with power to spare and better graphics capability, means that you can have something that's far more than an entry level PC with it. It used to be that a lower end Intel processor meant saving money by compromising. But depending on your needs, it might give you as much as you can throw at it. For real world applications in daily use, I get more performance out of the PC with this processor than I get out of my laptop with an i7. You need to go by your system as a whole.If you run the types of applications that truly need more power, you will know what they are and wouldn't be looking at this one. If you aren't sure that an i3 can meet your needs, for a typical user who runs multimedia applications, common gaming applications, web, email and office type applications, you probably won't see an advantage with a faster processor unless you use software to measure the difference. The throughput that you will get with any SSD will be the maximum, so there's no limitation in that respect. And if you don't find the graphics more than good enough for your purposes, you would probably be buying a separate video card anyway.

$review_text.: Theoretically, an HDMI cable is an HDMI cable. I ordered this one because it's cheap and had good feedback, but unfortunately my experience was anything but positive. The cable doesn't work. I plugged in my ps3 - at first, random bits of noise/white lines would show up on the screen. In the span of one day of use, the cable started to short out - I would lose the connection. Then it stopped working altogether - still in the same day. Simply put, a piece of junk that doesn't work.

$review_text.: This is exactly the keyboard I've been looking for. I've reclaimed some desk space with its compact design. I paid reasonable money for a keyboard that does its job right out of the box and nothing more. The money and space I saved not going for the gargantuan illuminated keyboard by Logitech can be banked toward that Wacom tablet I'm eyeing. This K300 is functional, sleek and there are no surprises since I knew what was here and what wasn't on this page. Recommended if you don't need gimmicks and you're trying to recoup desk space.

$REVIEW.: I am neither a tween nor a hip adult, but I still love this twist-top neoprene case in the blue mosaic flower print. I needed something in which to store my Kindle Fire at home and carry along in my briefcase while traveling. This case is perfect. It's light, holds my Kindle securely, and in spite of the snug fit, it is still easy to put my Kindle into or remove it from the case.  And, the soft, fuzzy lining does indeed wipe fingerprints and smudges off the screen.I like the way the twist-top folds over the end and holds the Kindle in the case. Also, the twists leave just enough open space to plug the cord in, so you can charge your Kindle Fire in the case.If you need a soft-sided case for your Kindle Fire (the older style, not the HD), I highly recommend this case. I love everything about it.

I did tons of research before making a final decision and I feel I made the best purchase decision. I read several reviews and articles about the high models actually producing less quality. At the appropriate viewing distance for the size of my screen, the picture couldn't really look much better. I imagine if I were to have wanted a much larger screen, I could have used the 1080p but otherwise I don't see the point.

$review_text.: I bought this card because the ATI HD3850 card I had previously displayed the nasty habit of giving me the dreaded B.S.O.D. every time I got online. The anal pain this caused on a continual basis was incredible, so this card was purchased to take care of that problem. Well....I'm happy to say that the GT440 got the job done in flying colors. Since I have installed this card I have had not ONE Blue Screen Of Death. The drivers will update via Win7, whereas the ATI CCC was always a chore of uninstall, got to safe mode, driver sweep, reinstall downloaded drivers...what a mess!One caveat I will share is that the latest set of drivers wanted to "flicker" for just a second before loading Firefox 4. That was taken care of by merely disabling the 2D2 option in FF4. Since I installed this card and made that one tweak, I have ran flawlessly and everything looks incredible. Plus, PC Probe tells me that I am actually running COOLER running more intensive graphics than I did with the old card.A whisper quiet card that really takes care of the business I need it to. I would recommend this card to the casual gamer or the hard-core web surfer. It just works, easy install and updates. Great card. Give it a shot.

$REVIEW.: Bose, a name known for its excellence of sound in the whole world. Many people are haters of Bose because of 2 reasons. 1) they cant afford it, 2) they are looking for different type of headphones. Basically, everyone needs to understand that Bose products are made for people who want to enjoy their music with great acoustics, and vocals. These are clearly not the headphones made for bass. Bass is present in a decent amount and to be truthful, these headphones are not for the consumer that wants to listen to dubstep. One small thing i would like to criticize Bose for is the top headband. This probably just happened to me but the top headband moves as in the foam inside,if you shake it, is moves like it is detached from the actual metal headband but now i will have to go to best buy and probably exchange and check it out. One great item that i like about this specific Bose headphone is it wireless capabilities. it has bluetooth capabilities of 4.0, the newest type of bluetooth and the quality is different from the wired ones to these bluetooth ones. Whats great is that if your bluetooth dongle is out of battrey, you can plug in the given cord and jam to your music even with the wire. Even then, another small thing i didnt like about these headphones is that they are a bit too pricey. They cost $250 which is $100 more than the wired ones and i dont think that its worth $100 for the average consumer to make the headphones bluetooth... unless you have the money

$review_text.: I'd almost give this laptop 5 stars but it makes some (some of which are unneeded) sacrifices to be thin and still affordable. I gave it a rating I think it deserves after spending time with it. Based on the needs of a student, who has a desktop at home for more intense things. I think this is a great laptop for someone who has a desktop already, it's probably not a good idea to use as your only computer. But Apple product reviews attract so many blind fanboys and haters that I'm going to try to give an unbiased review. You really have to ask yourself, are the sacrifices Apple made worth the portability.First what it does have.- The thinnest and lightest 13" laptop you'll find. Period.- Silent operation. I don't mean extremely quiet I mean silent. The only time I hear a soft fan noise was when I really stressed it out.- Nice bright screen with an excellent picture.- Instant on from sleep, and boots up from "off" in seconds.- Decent battery life. Lasts weeks in sleep and 7-8 hours of use.-The Magsafe charger. Something found on all modern Macbooks. I am a fan of this since it won't break or pull the laptop down if you trip on it.- OS X, what can I say once you try OS X you'll only use Windows for Windows exclusive programs and games. Check out the OS X reviews, or better yet go into an Apple store and see it for yourself. Also worth noting is upgrades are a LOT cheaper than a Windows upgrade.- Surprisingly good sound, given the fact that you cant even see the speakers. They won't blow you away (especially if you're an audiophile) but they match my Windows laptop, and that's good enough for a laptop.- The same camera found on the iPhone, which you can use for Facetime or other video chatting.- The USB ports are high powered, meaning they can charge tablets (unlike standard ports that don't provide enough juice), and most importantly they can run external drives that require two USB port from only one port.- SSD storage. SSD is fast enough that it makes up for any lack of speed the processor may have. It's the reason for t- Decent GPU. I was actually expecting to see a crappy Intel GPU in this, instead you have the best on board graphics out. It's not going to hod a candle to dedicated solutions, but if you expected that on an utltra portable you were kidding yourself.What it's missing- Ports. It has two USB ports, one SD slot, and one Mini Display Port (which is useless without an adator unless you have an Apple monitor). Considering it's lack of a DVD drive and storage space, you may find yourself using one or both of those on storage alone.- No CD/DVD. When traveling I can live without this, but everything is not yet digital. There are times when one needs a CD/DVD drive.- Storage. To save space and increase speed Apple used an SSD chip (similar to the iPad). Unfortunatly, while fast this means it cannot be upgraded. If you want more space you'll have to buy an external drive- Outdated CPU. I find it sad that Apple went with a CPU that will be outdated before you even get your laptop home. This thing with a modern i5 would have been a beast. Supposidly it has to do with the i5 not mixing with the nVidia GPU, but I don't know that I buy that. That said, the effecian OS X and super fast SSD mean the laptops performance can still match many i5 Windows laptops.So there you have it.  Hope this helps you make a decision not based on people who think Apple deserves their worshipping or those who think it should burn just for attracting such people.

The Class 6 accesses my photos, music, and apps (installed on the SD) much faster than with the other card. 8GB is also quite an upgrade from 2GB, so now I don't have to worry about my pictures and music filling up the card.The Frustration Free Packaging is also nice...

For under $20 the tuneband provides secure anchoring of my new ipod nano. The strap is easy to adjust and mostly comfortable. The silicone skin is soft and allows fairly easy access to the controls and does seem to keep moisture (sweat) from the nano.

$REVIEW.: To begin with...so many of these screen protectors get bad reviews for difficulty of application. I found this screen to be a bit tricky to put down but if you take your time, lay it down slowly and use a stiff credit card edge to press the bubbles out, it should all turn out ok. The other trick is to leave a small corner up so that if necessary, it can be lifted up and pressed back down again to remove bubbles...I ended up with two extremely small bubbles on the outer edges of the Xoom which do not affect viewing whatsoever. The main reason I got this was for the anti-glare feature and for that point it worked great. I'm in an office with strong flourescent lighting and viewing the Xoom at most angles was a bad experience. Once I got the screen cover on however, it was the difference between night and day...the screen could be seen easily from most angles now, especially the prime angle, when perched in the charging cradle. The screen cover also tends to reduce the finger smudges that used to drive me crazy. So overall, don't be afraid of this, take a shot. There's always an extra one in the package if you mess up the first one.

$REVIEW.: I bought this Opteka remote release product because it's RF-based and not infra-red: better range, does not always require line-of-sight. I was a little worried when I read comments about its connectors not fitting Nikon cameras well. It turns out I never have that issue, the cable that comes with it fits both my Nikon D800 and D300s cameras perfectly, albeit one must be careful in inserting and detaching the cable. Furthermore it greatly helps my Nikon D800, which under appropriate circumstances may require its mirror UP before taking pictures or not using the shutter release button on the camera to reduce blurring due to camera shakes.Using this Opteka product is also very intuitive, its manual could use more detailed illustrations, but one can easily put it to work immediately.I've tested the range all over our house and yard and between floors, all work fine.Operations are quite simple, slight (half) pressing the transmitter focuses the camera, full pressing snaps the picture with such focus.There is a slight difference in sensitivities using this remote between D800 and D300s. Using with the D300s mimics the feel-and-touch of the camera's shutter release button perfectly. But the D800 is definitely more sensitive with this remote, I ended up taking several pictures when the D800 is set to continuous mode even though I thought I had only pressed half way on the transmitter; this does taking some getting used to in order to master the right "touch" for my D800.Overall: Great product, works as advertised and does everything I need; I'll see how it last/perform over the long term; I also look forward to using it with my camera(s) for nature/animal photography where I may be some distance away from my camera setup.

I have been disappointed with this camera ever since, because it doesn't have a light and doesn't have a hotshoe. The camera overall has fair to poor video quality indoors because of this.With this device you can maneuver and point the light in every direction. I move mine in front of the video screen, and point the light at about a 10 degree angle to the right. This way the video screen is behind the light, and you can fully open the video screen.

$review_text.: I was super-excited about the Kensington Proximo Key FOB Bluetooth Tracker. When it first arrived, I wanted to hook it up right away, because I'm always misplacing my phone! I was afraid that the Kensington Proximo Key FOB Bluetooth Tracker was going to be large and cumbersome, but when I took it out of the box, I was pleasantly surprised to see it's very small and compact. I also discovered that the phone would be able to beep the Kensington Proximo Key FOB Bluetooth Tracker in case you loose your keys. A very good idea!This is when it all went downhill for me. First I had to download a new app into my phone. This is not a huge issue to many people, but i feel like I spend a lot of time trying to get rid of apps from my phone, not adding new ones that are barely used. So, fine, I downloaded the app and tucked in away in my &#34;Stuff I barely use&#34; file (mostly full of things the iPhone won't let you delete).I set to playing with my new Kensington Proximo Key FOB Bluetooth Tracker. After fiddling with it for a few minutes, I discover that it only works when the app is open. So, if you loose your keys, turn on the app and find them. But if you loose your iPhone; Too bad! You should have left the app open and running!I find that the longer I've owned my phone, the shorter the battery lasts. So I tend to immediately close all apps when I'm done with them. I also limit the apps I add to my phone. The Kensington Proximo Key FOB Bluetooth Tracker is effective and does its job, but I don't value its service enough to keep it open and draining my precious battery life.

$review_text.: This mount was a breeze to install.  Took me maybe 30 minutes from start to finish.  And that included running the cables and hooking them back up.  I would recommend a stud finder if you arent that good with DIY stuff.  The built in level and the plastic one that came with the kit are junk.  I tried both levels, and for one, neither of them would show level at the same time.  And then i put my regular craftsman level on there and both of the levels in the kit were off.No big deal.  Just use your own level.  The bolts that came with the kit were heavy duty and strong.  The hardware kit had bolts in there for every tv in my house.  Lg, Vizio, Sanyo.  I haven't tried this HDMI cable yet, but the other mount I purchased had a very low quality HDMI cable in it.  So I'm guessing this one is probably the same.Amazon has a good price on Mediabridge HDMI cables.  Pick you up one of those instead for an extra $10.Assembly was a breeze.  This kit came is 6 pieces.  Top, Bottom, 2 sides, 2 front panels.  You attach the sides with simple screws and once they are on, this thing is sturdy.I would recommend this mount for any size TV.  I mounted a 55" LG LED 3D TV with this mount.
$review_summary.: Great Mount

$review_text.: I read a couple bad reviews and a couple good reviews about this when I bought mine but I rolled the dice and got one since I needed one and it wasn't that expensive.  The bad reviews were dead wrong.  One said the battery life was bad.  I use mine every day at work and I am still on the original battery.  I've had mine for over a month so I don't know what kind of expectations they had.  I thought I was going to be changing them once a week.  I get free batteries at work so I didn't really care but still.  I read the connectivity was bad.  I will admit every once in a while it will do this thing where it disconnects and I have to fiddle with it to make it work again.  But I won't claim that it's any more hassle than every other electronic device ever.  Some people are just whiny.  I've also connected it to my BlackBerry Playbook and a Bluetooth dongle I have on my HTPC and both work fine.The whole reason I'm writing this review is I'm returning to amazon to buy two more of these, one to keep at work, one to keep in the living room for the HTPC, and one for my home PC.  Read the good reviews.  Ignore the bad ones.

$review_text.: I purchased this in the hope it would live up to the hype I'd heard over the year.  The sound is awesome even with the cheap pair of earbuds they include in the box.You have to fool around a little with the software until you get a feel for the bright new portable sound system (It's All Of That).  I have three other MP3's, and I have to say this is better than Ipod and Zune.  You can do so much more with this player.  Do yourself a favor and buy it while the price is so low.  Look at the rave reviews and go with it.  It's a true bargain.

$REVIEW.: I just got this configured today after 4 grueling hours of trying to. I am a new person to installing a security cam and this was nothing like the other one I installed a couple of months ago.  YOU MUST follow the steps exactly to get this camera to work wirelessly.  If you have the installation CD download it and follow the directions.  Their is an IP camera finder that after you have your camera plugged into your wireless router and powered on it will tell you the local ip address that was assigned on your wireless router.  Be sure you know how to access your web interface for your router before starting anything so you can verify and see what is going on thru the whole process.  All the router to assign the IP address for the router then type that address into your web browser and see the camera's web interface.  Mine was 192.168.1.112 initially.  Make sure you can see the camera software at that address.  Then  make sure you know your wireless network user id and password.  While in the camera software go to the wireless setup and check the box that says &#34;to use wirelessly&#34; then &#34;scan&#34; to find your wireless internet id highlight it and put in your password.  I also had to click on the box that said tkp and AES to make sure the camera would work with my router.  Once you do that the camera will reboot, it will move up to the right then to the left then back to center, there is a window on the web interface that counts down from 30 (seconds). AFTER the camera stops moving count to 10 and disconnect the Ethernet cable from the back of the camera and then WAIT for up to a minute. Before the camera reboots again you get a message  box on the web browser about installing something from Szchen China.  Say ok and then the camera will reboot when it is done cycling from up to right to left you should see the green light on the back of the camera flashes rapidly.  You also will notice the ip address on your router is now a different number and that the MAC id has also changed.  Check and see if you have video and if you do Yay you saved 3 hours of tedious repetitive booting and rebooting.  Now if after you enter your wireless information as I indicated above and waited for the camera to reboot then count to 10 seconds then remove the Ethernet cable I can't remember if took the power plug out of the back of the camera or not to get the camera to boot up again and finalize being wireless.  The best advise is go online to Foscam and print out the support info they have.  The basics are get video with the Ethernet cable still connected, then get the wireless configured then if you have a DNS service you can configure a static IP on the wireless router, then come back to the camera's web ip browser and configure the same static DHCP address as on your wireless router.  Make sure you also  do the port forwarding on the wireless router and the camera's ip software. I found it was a lot of trial and error hence it took me so long.  I made sure I backed up the camera's settings so I hopefully I will never have to do from scratch again.  I LOVE the features of the camera.  You can shut off the IR so you can point the camera out of a window and have a porch light on and still see what's going on by a door.  If you use the IR behind a window you end up with a bright white globe and really can not seeing anything.  Also this does have audio that you can also turn off.  Also setting up user accounts for people to access the webcam from the www is easy and you can limit their access to changing device settings by putting them on visitor status.  Very please overall!!!!!
$SUMMARY.: great camera a bit tedious to set up

$REVIEW.: As far as &#34;universal&#34; products go, this is probably as good as anything out there, but if they make something for your specific device, definitely go for that.  The &#34;fingers&#34; tend to get in the way of things like charger ports, headphone jacks, volume buttons, etc.  You can rearrange the fingers two a couple different positions, but for my particular device, that means that the phone is being pushed into a weird angle because of where the fingers were moved to accommodate my volume buttons.  Also, the fingers tend to cover a little bit of the screen where they go over, so you need to position phone icons and such accordingly.

$review_text.: ==================Using a 3.2 kernel==================Update: February 12, 2012This enclosure works flawlessly in Debian stable (Squeeze / 6.0) with a 3.2 kernel from backports. (linux-image-3.2.0-0.bpo.1-amd64)The included cable is very short and impossible to use with a desktop, but it's okay for a laptop where the ports are more accessible and closer to a flat surface.When copying data to the drive continuously for a long time (30+ minutes), I recommend removing the hard drive from its case so it won't get too hot. My temps drop about 4-5 degrees when removed from the case.==================Using a 2.6 kernel==================These were my results with a 2.6 kernel in Debian at the time of my original review last year.Linux host 2.6.39-bpo.2-amd64 #1 SMP Tue Jul 26 10:35:23 UTC 2011 x86_64 GNU/LinuxThis product is NOT 100% compatible with a 2.6 kernel.

However, advertising this as Linux compatible is still false advertising since no current version of Linux has addressed this yet as of this review date.Some details here: [...]This thread mentions USB3.0 devices, but I see it with newer 2.0 devices as well.

$review_text.: First off, I'm happy with the player (mind you that I'm not an HT maven, and did obtain it at 40% discount) but I doubt I'd recommend it to anyone I know. Here's why, through a list of random impressions:* Rather than integrate a few token services (Netflix, Hulu, Pandora, etc.) Samsung built a big, cheesy app store over their "Smart Hub desktop." Some of these are good--watching the latest Korean sitcoms on-demand (English subs, natch) was more fun than I'd have predicted, yet most of its channels & extensions are merely diverting, cute, or ridiculous. They stock a wider range of gadgets and widgets than you'd find on Tivo, but consider first how badly you need weather/exercise/screensaver add-ons published for Samsung's proprietary OS. No kid older than 7 & under 25 is going to tolerate the supplied games (which they spring on you during update, without prompting) and due to the 256 megs of storage you can't expect software much beyond stream frontends or search engine utils. It usually crashes back to the home menu at least once a session and the glitchiness is never far off, e.g. after installing Google Maps there's an error to explain they revoked the service 4 months ago.* I knew Disc-to-Digital wouldn't work for Vudu (now a Walmart property) but I couldn't use it for Flixster either, contrary to the procedure printed in their manual. Samsung may as well stop touting a feature about which the studios are plainly leery. These apps all include some promo credit that I used before adding in my real accounts.* Briefly makes a whirring noise on start-up and, disappointingly, a similar low whirring during disc playback, audible in the quiet spots. It's not quite bad enough for me to stuff it into a cabinet. The included remote is a joke: buttons mostly the same size, monochromatic except for the idiot-proof gigantic Netflix logo, and no backlight.* Video format support is fair, though getting more obsolete by the week of course. AVCHD & Mastroska were the biggies to me (you have to rename .MKV to .AVI). Unless you connect storage to the USB input, you'll need a media server running on your LAN, e.g. Samsung's dodgy "AllShare" s/w installed on your PC hosting the files, or the DLNA add-ons for Windows Media Center which more or less accomplish the same. Overall hardware support seems pretty good; I was pleased that my Lenovo ThinkPad keyboard-trackpad was recognized right away, and you can string everything off a hub (multiple thumb drives). N.B. this unit sports HDMI + TOSLINK outputs only.* Wi-fi reception was surprisingly strong and had settings exposed that I don't fully understand, like a "direct connect mode" and pseudo-hotspot capability. Considering the featuritis vs. obsolescence dynamic within this market segment Samsung might be over-egging the pudding here. The presence of a web browser does raise a good question: would this work in lieu of a nettop for common spaces requiring video display, like a lobby, waiting area, or conference room? The answer is No, at least not if anybody has a 3G phone there. Though it supports multiple tabs, bookmarks, and history the browser is a bit too clunky (not as if this machine has a real CPU) with screwy page rendering inter alia. After 15 minutes of checking e-mail, viewing blogs, and visiting sites with non-functional Flash elements, it occurred to me that this would be perfect for accessing the Remote Potato GUI, and just about nothing else. You won't get an HTPC out of this Blu-ray player.

$review_text.: Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of B+W. I also own their circular polarizer MRC and 10 stop ND filter which are both fantastic. I bought this for my Sigma 35mm f/1.4 and believe me when I say that lens is SHARP. But I do see a very slight degradation of image quality with this on no matter how clean it is. I think when this (or any) filter is attached you will lose a bit of that wow-factor. I think this would be a great product on something like the 18-200, but for the high end primes like the Sigma 35mm f/1.4 or the Nikon 24mm f/1.4 this will negatively impact your photos.

$REVIEW.: Taking off a full 2 stars for instructions on how to attach the mounts - there are none. I can see why some reviewers experienced lost GoPros (I'm using them with my Sony AS100V) if they just slapped them on their board and hit the waves. You need to clean the boards and let the adhesive cure for 24 hours. I knew to look because I saw the reviews about lost cams and checked GoPros website for instructions (also found a you-tube video). Still, how can they package these mounts without including instructions?On the other side, there is no way I'm trusting $250+ worth of equipment to two adhesives so those burned reviews have to take some blame. I couldn't get a floaty ($20) in time so I tie-wrapped a piece of Styrofoam to my cam before I went in the water. Not taking any chances. Does it look cheap? Yes. Does it work? Oh yeah. Better to have it and not need it than not have it and have $250 swallowed by the ocean.

$review_text.: This Tenba bag is one of the most rugged bags I have ever seen designed for the office-on-the-go.  There are tons of pockets to fit everything from tablets to phones to memory cards to business cards to laptops, and more!  Compartment after compartment folds out, all water resistant, where you can store your mobile office.  There is one very large compartment that could hold a sizeable and thick piece of gear, while the other compartments are much shallower in depth.Now, while this is extremely useful for an event photographer who will likely need all of those things to pull off a wedding, if you are just looking for a camera bag this is the wrong item.  Amazon calls it the "Executive Bag for Camera," however there is really no part of this bag that would be good for anything more than a compact fixed lens camera - there are no lens dividers or anything like that.So, this is an event photographers dream bag to accompany a camera bag, but realize that this bag will not do everything - you still need to buy a camera bag.  I don't believe Tenba advertises this bag "for Camera" on their website either, so it may be an Amazon error.That out of the way, if you are an executive or event photographer on the go that needs a rugged backpack to hold the contents of a portable office, I could not imagine any better bag than this one to do the job.  Just don't expect it to be a substitute for a DSLR bag, because that is not what it was designed for.

$review_text.: To the point:  EXCELLENT earbuds.  My experience with this product has been great.  For what it's worth, I'm a professional recording engineer.  Does it make me an authority on all things audio?  The answer is NO!If you're reading this review, then YOU are going to be the expert.  Hearing for the most part is like fingerprints----everybody is different, though there is some common ground on what sounds "good."  The sound quality is very well-balanced in these earbuds.  Good bass, mids, and highs.  They're going to be good for all around music listening during the workout, sitting at the airport----anywhere within reason.  Critical listening?  Would not be my first choice, but then these earbuds are not made for the studio.  Don't expect the starship Enterprise when flying a paper airplane.Don't expect to tune the loud outside world out----go to Bose for noise canceling.  These buds are touted as, NOISE ISOLATING.  I personally feel this is a catch phrase to make the consumer look twice, but I can tell you as long as you seat these earbuds with the right fit of the several choices of supplied tips, you're going to find that the "isolating" quality is fairly good at moderate volume levels, and even better when cranked up----no brainer there, but keep in mind ear damage.I find these buds to be quite comfortable with long periods of wear, both in and out of the ear.  The '"memory" loop that goes around your ear isn't spot on, but good enough to be "worn" in with only minor adjustments every so often, and stay in place with a lot of movement - jogging, biking, and other similar activities.The case is a nice touch and is not junk.  I believe, as with most things, if you take just some obvious care i.e. use the case, don't wad the buds up, don't get them wet, etc, these will last a long time and deliver good, if not great performance for a long time.Bottom line----grab 'em.  You can afford another pair if they get lost.  At this price grab a couple of pairs.  I did, and for my workouts, or tucked up under a helmet, these earbuds are a great deal that deliver great performance without paying a premium for much more expensive models.Hope this helps!

$REVIEW.: Grace Digital's GDI-IRC7500 Music System, is an internet radio and multi-media audio player, that utilizes a Wi-Fi connection, to access a vast array of radio stations, supposedly upwards of 17,000 at the time of this writing.With a pair of speakers, mounted inside a wooden cabinet, the unit is capable of delivering very good quality sound.  The console does more than play radio, as the unit also has line in jacks to receive audio input from a MP3 player, or other source.  In addition, the unit has a USB port, and is capable of reading data from a flash drive or external hard drive, and playing MP3 and other audio files stored there.  The device also has a built in clock, with alarm and sleep functions.The console has a rather large footprint, measuring approximately 13.7" wide, 9.5" deep, and 5.3" high.  There are knobs and buttons on the top, so this "control pad" area probably needs to remain accessible, to achieve full functionality.  There is an easy to read color display screen on the front face, and a remote control unit is also included.When first activated, the unit will search for an available wireless network.  After providing a password (if necessary), the unit should connect to your router, and be ready to access local radio stations, or search for available stations on the internet.  Once a station is selected, connection typically takes just a few seconds.Tone is adjusted through one of the menus. With a pair of woofers and tweeters, the speakers deliver pretty robust sounds on both the low and high end, however at only about 4" in diameter, you shouldn't expect thick rich bass tones. The unit produces enough sound for a small to mid-sized space, but to get really high volumes, you would need to connect it to an amp with speakers, using the line out jacks located on the back panel.The control can be accomplished using the buttons on the top of the unit, or via the remote.  Once you become familiar with the controls, you can get things done more efficiently, as many of the functions are accessed from a "Home" screen on the display.  The included 50 page manual is fairly helpful, but it is still lacking in some respects.  You can save your favorite stations, but with thousands of channels available, it's disappointing that the maximum number of presets is only 10.  You can however save additional stations to your "My Stations" folder, where they came be accessed later.  The response to the remote isn't the greatest, and the layout and functionality of the buttons could be better.  For instance, the frequently "Home" button, could be larger and more prominent.By registering your radio at Grace Digital's website, you can link an existing Pandora account to the radio, and play the content from your stations.  If you do not have a Pandora account, you can easily create one for free.  Other available providers include HeartRadio, Rhapsody, and SiriusXM.In the brief time I have used the unit, I have only scratched the surface in exploring the multitude of audio content that is available.  Getting back in touch with my past, I have been very pleasantly surprised at being able to listen to songs that I haven't heard on the radio for several decades.  I am also looking forward to exploring many new realms, as news, sports, weather, talk, college radio stations, podcasts, and a multitude of other choices, are just a few steps away.  One of my favorite stations is North Sea Surf Radio, which plays surf rock instrumentals.  Most of the stations have very few commercials, which helps to maximize the listening experience, which could easily become very addictive.  Even if you are well acquainted with a particular musical genre, you can still discover new music and artists, through internet radio.The generous people at Grace Digital provided a sample of this terrific product for evaluation, and in terms of performance, this unit gets very high marks, as it is an excellent internet radio, and also has the capability to play audio from a variety of sources.  The color display is informative, easy to read from a distance, and also displays graphics.  The controls may not be the most efficient, but should get you to where you want to go.  At the top of Grace Digital's line of internet radios, the cost of GDI-IRC7500 is on the high side, but may well be worth the investment, if you appreciate music from non-traditional sources.

$review_text.: Shortly after the iPad Air was announced I went to the Tech Armor site to see if they were offering screen protectors for the Air and sure enough they were.  That was quick, probably one of the first to hit the market.  I immediately ordered the 2-pack in hopes that it would arrive before I picked up the Air on launch day.  It arrived a few days before and I was so glad because I knew my new iPad would be protected the moment I took it out of the packaging.  What a relief.  When looking for screen protectors you won't be disappointed with going with Tech Armor.  They always include multiple screen protectors in one package for much less than what the competitors charge for just one protector.  This makes it nice in the event you mess up the installation somehow and need to apply another one (which by the way they offer FREE replacements if you do!).  I've been using Tech Armor screen protectors on all my devices and haven't had any issues.  They go on easy if you follow the instructions carefully (their website offers detailed instructions and videos).  You can hardly tell there is even a screen protector applied (only for the HD Clear versions, the Antiglare protectors will have more of a noticeable matte finish even though they claim it to be the HD version of their original Antiglare protector).  Your finger can still glide smoothly across the screen, the glass surface feel is still there as if you're touching the screen with no film at all.  My only complaint is that it retains fingerprint marks and smudges, just like the screen would, and can be a little difficult to wipe completely clean if you use just a polishing cloth.  If you want to clean the protector and get rid of all fingerprints and leave it completely streak free you will need a screen cleaning solution with a microfiber cloth.  After you spray it down you will need to &#34;buff&#34; the screen protector to get rid of all the streaks.  But it's not much of a concern since you'll constantly be getting fingerprints all over the screen.  The difference between this screen protector and the one for the previous version iPad 4th Gen is the size of course but also the cutout for the FaceTime camera is more elongated (pill shaped) and not round like the previous version.  This is helpful when you don't perfectly align the screen protector.  It's less likely you'll accidentally cover up the camera with the protector, even if partially.  I thought that was a smart change and it's good to know that Tech Armor is thinking about the small details.  I highly recommend Tech Armor for any of their screen protectors.  Great value and a great product!

$REVIEW.: The 5D instruction manual says that "The HDMI Cable HTC-100 (sold separately) is required" to connect to the 5D to an HDMI monitor/TV.That cable goes for $69.  I bought the Mediabridge 5ft Mini-HDMI to HDMI Version 1.3b Category 2 for only $12 and it works fine.I think (maybe someone can verify this) that any 1.3b mini HDMI to HDMI cable will work just fine.By the way, the camera is awesome.  I have had it for a few days now and I love it.  It shoots beautiful pictures at 3200 ISO, so there's really no need for a flash.  And it shoots usable (but noisy) photos at 25,600 ISO.That's the end of the review.  Now a bit of advice on buying this camera:My advice (for what it's worth) is don't overpay just to have this camera a few weeks early.  You're going to be using this thing for 5 years, so whether you get it in January or February doesn't make a big difference.  I was lucky enough to buy it (in kit form) from Amazon directly and not from some unknown electronics store.Whatever you do, avoid J&R; in New York.  If you are thinking about buying the 5D from them please send me a note and I will explain what happened when I pre-ordered the camera from J&R; (I ultimately cancelled my order and I have resolved to never buy anything from them in future.)

I've had no issues and the connection speed have been great. Please note you MUST have a thunderbolt port. There are USB adapters that do the same thing for less, but since the MBP (Retina) has only two USB ports, I opted for the thunderbolt adapter (MBP also has two thunderbolt ports, but I have much less need for them).Quality and functionality is great for this product, but I'm knocking off one star because the MBP should have had an ethernet port already on it like previous generations.

$review_text.: Sony makes a good, lightweight portable Walkman that lets me enjoy my cassette tapes, the radio (with pre-set radio channels both AM and FM) and weather reports. Playing the tapes is so easy that I didn't need instructions as to how to insert a tape and play it; but I did need the instructions to know how to pre-set radio stations and use the weather feature. There's a way to emphasize the bass, too. Fortunately, I was able to learn this relatively quickly and that's another plus.The Walkman comes with comfortable headphones; but if you want noticeably improved sound quality I recommend you switch to headphones that are a bit better. True, you'll pay extra for this; but the sound is everything here and it's worth it in the long run.The Walkman that shipped to me did not come with a TV band on it; I'm not sure why Amazon talks about this in their product description.The Walkman takes one AA battery and the battery lasts longer than I thought it would. I get quite a few hours of enjoyment out of just one battery. For the best results, choose good quality batteries such as Duracell.Overall, this Walkman is a good choice especially for those of us who still cherish our cassette tapes. I recommend it! Try the headphones that come with it first but don't be surprised if you want somewhat better ones instead.

$review_text.: My first TiVo, purchased a year ago, was the reason I bought this adapter, because it is the only one that TiVo says it has tested and guarantees to work with their product.  And the first one DID, although I wondered about how flimsy it seemed.  Well, I used the included dongle to hook it up and no problems, saw the network, and has worked great.So enter into my household TiVo #2.  This one has the built-in DVD recorder.  So I dutifully trotted off and bought another Linksys adapter to hook it up too.Nothing but trouble - the first one I got home with, the little metal arms that hold the plastic door were broken, so no possibility of connecting.Back to Staples, where exchanges are easy at least.  Got another one, and back home again, got it hooked up - it could see the network OK but kept losing connectivity!  After much gnashing of teeth and pulling of hair, removed the known good adapter from TiVo #1, swapped with the NEW adapter, and guess what - now TiVo #2 is fine and #1 is intermittent!  GRRRRRR!  What a piece of junk.  Hubby wanted to immediately take it out in the backyard and smash it to bits but hey, I paid $30 for it so it too shall return to Staples.I've now ordered up the Netgear USB adapter from Amazon and am awaiting its arrival - from the looks of it, it's much more substantial than this flimsy little "toy" adapter from Linksys.TiVo, get with the program and stop recommending this junk!!

$REVIEW.: i do not do much cpu or disk intensive stuff so your results may vary, but in my experience the chillmat for mac has lowered temps from being very warm to the touch to almost room temperature (as reported by istatnano on a mbp 13.3). the chillmat is made entirely of plastic and for some reason my unit creaked and seemed wobbly from the start, but it is usable if you often use your computer on your lap. the bottom is covered in an elastic mesh type of material and inside are two fans that blow air upwards. the fans are only active when you plug in the usb power cord and turn on the power, there is no pass-through port so that you can still use the usb port on the computer. this can be annoying if your laptop does not have many usb ports to begin with. the main issue i have with this particular chillmat model is the rubber nubs that are supposed to grip the bottom of the computer, they do not work (at least not for aluminum bodied macs) and your computer will slide around. the rubber nubs on the bottom of the mb/mbp seem to do a better job of keeping the computer on the chillmat compared to the targus nubs.

I purchased one speaker and am running it in mono mode. However, I am sure that a second speaker would produce great stereo sound. The sound quality is very good. There has been rare occasional interference (static). The range is as described. It works well with audio out put from the amplifier tuner and with digital streaming from my cable TV service through my amplifier.

$REVIEW.: Bought it for $799 and have absolutely no regrets!  Excellent 3D and 2D performance.  Took me a few days of fiddling with settings until I got it right and WOW!  As good as some of the much higher priced (2-4X) and looks good in medium to dark rooms.  Not the best for bright rooms.  Fast moving images look real with no blur or shadow like (even the best) LCDs.  As far as the picture and 3D effects, I was amazed at how well it performs and that is why I got it to begin with.I have not (even after trying) heard the buzz or hum that a reviewer complained about.  Mine is absolutely silent.The sound on this model is not very good although speech is clear, but overall, the sound is just barely adequate for watching TV, and not adequate for movies.  I have a sound system so it is not a problem, and anyone who wants to watch movies will probably have a good sound system so this becomes a minor point.Overall, very pleased with this purchase and expect many years of good solid service since it is the new plasma and these last much longer.  Highly recommended if it fits your needs (you have a sound system and your room is not too bright).

Thus far it has been running like a champ in stability and performance and resides at the end of a series of other switches (48 port, 8 port and an 100 foot cable and 50 foot cable).  It clearly is faster than a 10/100 hub-switch and it has been stable (in the 3 days or so we've been using it).

$REVIEW.: Since I like to leave my Cokin filter system attached to my lens a lot, I figured, this would be perfect to allow me to keep it on there even more.  Previously I had to remove it every time I had to put the lens-cap back on.  With this, I can just slide the cap in place and be on my way.  Very nicely done.  When properly inserted, the cap seals off the front glass of the lens preventing dirt and objects from making contact with the lens.  The fit is very snug and will not fall out.As stated, the filter needs to be inserted correctly.  If you don't get it in the right slot, it will leave a gap allowing dust and dirt in.  So please make sure you seat it well.  This is a bit tricky at first, but if you watch for it, you'll catch it.For the price, it is worth it, even if the price is a little high.  In my opinion, better to spend the price of this cap, than to repair the front element of your lens.  ;)

$REVIEW.: Having only a stock radio with a CD player, my options were limited when wanting to listen to my iPod in the car.  I first tried Griffin's iTrip with unsatisfactory results.  Reception was terrible and the sound even worse.  In fact, I swore off FM transmitters until I came across this Kensington.  What a difference!The reception is incredible, likely because the FM transmitter itself doesn't attach to the iPod but is instead part of the DC charger.  This means the FM transmitter is ALWAYS located close to your car's radio antenna.  No more worrying about placing iPod in just the right spot to achieve clear reception!  In fact, iPod can sit in the backseat and not affect reception one iota.  And what a plus not draining iPod's battery, too.The sound?  Probably as good as it gets without a direct audio connection.  No it's not CD quality, but with compressed music files, you won't achieve this anyway.  As others have stated, you will need to adjust iPod's EQ to minimize the exaggerated "psst" sounds of some of the upper register notes and vocals.  No big deal to choose "Treble Reducer," although I found this tends to constrict the sound too much.  Believe it or not, I found the best EQ setting is "Off."  The music is clear, vibrant and alive.In short, if you're in the market for a FM transmitter, and you don't set your expectations too high, I think you will be pleased with the Kensington's performance.  Yes, it costs a little more than the competition, but sometimes you really do get what you pay for!

$REVIEW.: I just picked up this Bluetooth mouse to test for Amazon Vine.  I was excited to add a mouse to my laptop without having a receiver taking up a USB port.  Boy was I surprised to find my laptop did not come with Bluetooth technology!  I assumed that was fairly standard but apparently not.  You might want to check that out before you choose to purchase this mouseSo two days later my Bluetooth adapter has arrived and I am up to speed. On my Windows 7 computer, the mouse installed with absolutely no problem.  The basic click functions of the mouse work just as you'd expect.  The scroll wheel does the normal up and down functions but also does a side to side scroll on pages wide enough to have a bottom scroll bar.  The scroll wheel also also acts a "middle click" button.  Who knew there was such a thing?  Some uses for this are: middle click on a browser tab to close it without having to hit the x, middle click on a link and it will open it in a new tab without having to right click and pick open in new tab, middle click on the refresh button of your browser and it will open a duplicate tab of the one you're on.  My head is spinning with the possibilities!The blue "Windows touch tab" is a new button by your thumb.  In Windows 7, clicking this will launch the Start menu.  "Swiping" it in either an up or down motion launches that view where the open windows are stacked on the desktop and allows you to scroll through then with continued swipes.  This isn't a Windows 7 feature I ever used so I doubt I'll ever use that feature of the mouse.The mouse has an on/off switch so you don't burn battery power when you're not using it.  I suspect the features of this mouse do much more amazing things in Windows 8 for which it was clearly designed.  For Windows 7, it still has some cool tricks up it's sleeves.  If your computer already has Bluetooth I think this would be an especially good choice.

$REVIEW.: Had my Grado SR80i's plugged into this thing, and it plugged into a little Behringer headphone amp.After the "jam session," I unplugged my Grados from it (not "yanked", mind you, unplugged,) and some of its innards came out on the plug for the Grados! Tried to reassemble, wasn't successful. Into the trash.

However the rest was not so simple.the legs on the stand would not open without two people pulling on them.Shroud assemble - the supplied metal rods ripped right through the material in the small pocket meant to retain them. When I go one in correctly the other rods ripped out the pocket opposite to them . At first I used shipping tape to re-enforce the pocket but the rods made short work of that. Then I use duct tape which almost worked. I played "whack a mole" with the rods for a while before I decided that they were just to inflexible and long. Into the workshop and after making a thumbnail estimate I cut of about 1/2" . I should mention that the material that was used to make the rods was probably the same steel use to make suspension bridges, it was very high quality and hard to cut.After I cut two rods down I was finally able to assemble the shroud. After that the white light cover was easy enough to put on. This stuff is functional but requires lots of patience and almost always some adjustments made by you. One the positive side the lights all turned on and the switches works and there is a 5v fuse on the back of the unit.

$REVIEW.: I have several of these small, hand-held video cameras and all have their individual perks--and flaws--but this release from Kodak is very average, not really having any perks over the competition.Here's the rundown:PROS:- Cheaper than others- "Waterproof" - although, as other users have found out, I probably wouldn't trust dunking this in the pool too much. I would think of it more "waterproof" in that, if you spill your bottle of water on it, it won't break. The lock mechanism that keeps the water out isn't very sophisticated, and in fact worse, in my opinion, than the other waterproof Kodak I have:Kodak PlaySport (Zx5) HD Waterproof Pocket Video Camera - Black  (2nd Generation)- SmallCONS:- Not 1080p (max is 720p)- May not actually be as waterproof as you'd like- Video can be a bit choppy/out of focus at times (but does look good overall)- No tripod mount- Poor quality still photos (only 1mp) (though does look fairly vivid nonetheless)OVERALL: My overall opinion is that, if you want a small video recorder that takes good quality video and pictures, I would buy a higher-end model that is 1080p and has a higher MP for taking pictures. Honestly, except for being "waterproof", this gadget isn't much better than any other smart phone. It seems kinda silly to buy a separate device for recording video if the quality isn't going to be significantly better. I don't think this is a BAD product, but in the sea of so many others like it, I can only give it an average 3-star rating.

$review_text.: (This review is from the perspective of someone who shot Nikon D70 -> D200 -> D300 for the better part of 10 years... and then sold it all to go a bit more prosumer than point-and-shoot, picking up the Fuji X100 last year.  I'm also not going into detail on the picture quality - you'll find countless reviews on other sites with side-by-side examples.)Here we go!- The shutter lag and autofocus speed are much faster than the X100 which is notoriously slow by any account.  Just in case you thought you needed an X100S (or better) to have a responsive Fuji camera, definitely not the case.  The X-M1 is terrific.- Picture quality, it's on par or better than the X100, easy.  While I've never shot film I've always been a huge fan of Fuji film and while no self-respecting SLR photographer would admit to this I'm going to  - I do end up using and liking the in-camera Fuji film effects: Velvia, Provia, etc.- Build quality... well I'm always mixed here on the small(er) bodies since I'm used to holding on to tanks like the D300.  The first thing you'll notice is that the XM-1, sans lens, feels and grips a bit like a hollow plastic box.  It's 1/2" smaller in width about a 1/4" shorter in height than the X100 and that small difference means I'm holding it with my fingertips instead of wrapping my hand around it the way you'd be used to with an SLR or even the X100.  Once you throw the a lens on, it gains a bit more heft and since your left hand (assuming you're right-handed) cradles the lens, you'll feel a bit better about the build.  The lack of a viewfinder (which I'll discuss next) mitigates this because you don't need to have the same grip control you'd need if you would be bringing your eye close the body.- Articulating back panel; I just don't see the utility.  When extended, it feels tenuously attached to the camera and with thin plastic arms, it's another thing that can break; why bother?  That feature seems out of place on this camera.  Will you really be throwing it on a tripod and looking straight down on it?- No viewfinder and no after-market options.  After years of shooting, it's just ingrained in me to pull the camera up to my eye.  If I ditch the XM-1, it will be for this reason.Overall these compact ILC bodies are starting to look like very attractive alternatives to lugging around piles of SLR gear.  I'm a convert and after shooting most any of the Fuji mid-tier lineup, I think you will be too.

$REVIEW.: I've used Kaspersky Internet Security now for going on 3 years and I won't use anything else. Why do I like it? It does what it sets out to do without slowing down my computers. I've tried other brands, but they've invariably slowed down my equipment or made it impossible for me to print, or created other difficulties for me.Kaspersky 2014 includes some new features such as Safe Money and Secure Keyboard, making banking and shopping more secure. The software is easy to install and operate. It provides real-time protection from viruses, spyware, malware, and parental protection. This particular version allows you to install it on 3 computers. A Gamer Mode allows gamers to play online games without interruption.I cannot recommend Kaspersky Internet Security highly enough for its easy-to-use features and the way it operates without compromising your computer's speed. Get it and see for yourself.

Checked it out and it works fine.I am very satisfied with this cool piece of technology - found the sound to be OK as well. Rating 4 stars (instead of 5) because I saw one reboot when fiddling with the power on the device and some of the menus.  That and I feel the user interface could be a little more intuitive - my wife is unfamiliar with GPS navigators and she took some time to work thru the menus.

$REVIEW.: This is my fifth gaming headset and from the gaming experience so far, should be the last headset I buy for quite some time.On the objective side of things, this headset is quite comfortable with no part of either ear "cup" resting on any part of the respective ears


 They don't squeeze too tightly, and do adjust for large heads that you might see on NFL football players
 My ten year-old child wears these quite comfortably as well; a head size on the other end of the spectrum.I've seen various reviews remarking of ears becoming warm and I suppose they might; a little
 But nothing really worth talking about.External noise is blocked well when gaming or listening to music.The microphone is more than satisfactory in both design and in clarity

 Easy adjustment and movement, and excellent voice reproduction- well, the various people with whom I've gamed all say it's been clear and undistorted.The one feature very different from my previous headsets (and many others) is the link/pivot/hinge connecting the the ear cups to the headband

 Very well thought-out design and allows for additional customization of comfort.Most people, myself included, don't pick up a headset with both hands- one on each ear cup

 Instead it's a quick grab of one cup with one hand whereby a fair amount of pressure is placed on that particular hinge
 Over time, that begins to break or weaken components
 Not so with this headset.Regarding frequency reproduction, I've run CDs used for tuning mixers with frequency sweeps/white noise/pink noise and I am impressed


 While nothing's impossible, I've not yet encountered any distortion with gaming, music or the aforementioned tuning CD.Granted- distortion potential relies in part, on the quality of the source

 On a side note, the soundcard I currently use on my gaming system is the old workhorse Soundblaster X-Fi XtremeMusic (I really *should* upgrade that component).On the subjective side:  "Properly" encoded music files have sounded delicious with clear lows, mids, and highs.Gaming has become a new world for me with so much more clarity, lovely undistorted explosions, and arresting immersion (Bioshock!).Okay..

 enough of the cheesy adjectives
 I'm impressed by this headset


 I like this headset


 And I will use this headset until it falls apart or until whenever someone gifts me a professional headset.In a previous professional life, I was a DJ and audio editor in television and radio
 Keep in mind, this headset is not intended for reference audio production but they've been perfectly adequate for my continued amateur work with Reason, Adobe Audition, etc.Though I was apprehensive prior to purchase, I have NO qualms about the money spent.(edit) It's some days later I'm drinking Cuba Libras listening to Shaggy in Creative Labs "Entertainment Mode" and the bass is ..


 well, my only wish would be for this headset to be wireless to make living-room dancing easier

(/edit)(08/12/09 edit) This headset is _GREAT_ with Rosetta Stone! (/edit)(03/01/13 edit)  Just checked back on this headset Amazon page

 Wow

 The price has really gone up since 2009
 By the way, the headset is still rockin' out and I'm thoroughly enjoying Battlefield 3 with it

$review_text.: I purchased this video card for my HTPC. This card upgraded a previous Sapphire Tech AGP video card. The card runs at very low power and doesn't require any additional power from the power supply, as other modern video cards do. Sapphire Tech provides excellent customer and support service in case of any issues. This particular model has 1 analog VGA connector, 1 DVI-D connector and a DisplayPort connector. The card also has a low-profile bracket for those who have low-profile HTPC cases.I don't recommend the card for the newest games. I occasionally play older PC games that don't require the latest and greatest video card with high frame rates. The card's main use, however, is to drive the widescreen TV as I use Windows Media Center for my TV viewing.The enclosed Catalyst Control Center software allows for overclocking the card. I didn't run any benchmarks, but did not see any noticeable difference with the card overclocked. To keep the card cool, I kept the card running at the native speeds.Overall, if you are looking for a great video card for your HTPC, this card is a great value for what you get under the hood.

The TV is a 42" that sits anywhere from 4 to 10 feet from a seating area.

$REVIEW.: These Maxwell phones are, on appearance, quite sturdy with a flat cord so it won't tangle easily


There are no remote controls for volume or song selection- the device must be used for this


There is a microphone for speaking but again the phone must be used when making or receiving calls- a bit unusual
One other problem is that the earphones themselves are quite long and as such, if used with sporting activities, (which it may not be appropriate for) may lead to a possible ear injury if one were to fall.To judge the sound- this is the strength- the sound is rich and full with a bass that resonates
It comes with three size earbuds for sizing purposes

These are good earphones with solid sound and a sturdy design but relatively spartan.

For Windows XP, I have been trying to get used to it.  It does feel comfortable, and it is very well built - it's solid.The space bar on the keyboard is now a small button to the left of the joystick thingy.  I have big hands, and this is a bit cramped.  I find that I like the keyboard better.  The LCD is about useless... during gameplay, I am not going to look down at the screen.I find that I cannot find the 'home' keys very well.  There is no 'bumps' to guide you to the home keys.  The indents are not deep enough to identify easily.I have been having issues with windows since I installed, so have put it on the shelf for now.  I think it has to do with the drivers, but I cannot tell.Wished I had not thrown all the packaging away.  No a good purchase for me.

$review_text.: Why pay extra fees to your Internet service provider (ISP) to lease your cable modem when you can own it outright?  Cable modems aren't very expensive and with Internet speeds becoming faster over the years, you're speed/value for the buck makes purchasing worthwhile.  ISPs charge around $6 a month in lease fees.  This savings will pay off your cable modem in about a year.If you're like me, you're looking at this Motorola SB6141 cable modem and considering it along with many others listed on your ISP's capability list.  Be sure to check for compatibility with your ISP before purchasing any cable modem.  If you're looking for a modem that will accommodate the fastest turbo-speeds available without going fiber, a DOCSIS 3.0 modem is the way to go; you're looking at a decent modem.I received mine a few weeks ago and had it activated last week.  It's a pretty simple device.  You connect your ISPs cable line to the back of the modem, connect your Ethernet cable, and plug the modem into an AC outlet.  Assuming your ISP has activated the modem, you're good to go.  If they haven't activated it, you'll need to contact your ISP to have them do so.As others have stated, the SB6141 has some very bright LEDs on the front.  You'll want to consider where it'll be installed.  If it's in a bedroom, you may want to block the LEDs in some way so they don't keep you awake at night.  We have ours in a utility room, so the LEDs provide a nice night light for when the lights are off.I suggest asking your ISP whether they provide firmware updates to customer-supplied modems.  Different ISPs operate differently in different cities.  Some ISPs only provide updates to customer-leased modems and no updates to customers with a purchased modem.Our local provider--Time Warner--provides firmware updates for customers who own their own modem.  I understand not all do though.  This is important to ensure your modem supports the latest technology offered by your ISP.  Unfortunately, users can't upgrade the firmware, as with other devices.  Only the ISP can update the firmware.  While there's nothing you can do if your ISP says they don't, it's a "nice to know" kind of thing.  I was pleased to know our modem will always have the ISP's most current firmware.  This ensures compatibility for years to come.I don't have much negative to say about this modem.  It's fast, small, reasonably priced, and it does its job very well.
$SUMMARY.: Very nice modem that allows you to save money over leasing!

$review_text.: I found my 256G Crucial M4 was getting filled up with all of my games on it. (Hey after loading a game off an SSD, I am spoiled and don't want to have to load one off of a HDD. :) ) I wanted to get a larger drive, a newer one too so I went with the 840 Pro. I noticed no performance difference from the M4 in games, or loading files, but in moving form one SSD to another I wasn't expecting too see a real world difference between the two.The part I was concerned about most, swapping my data/OS to this new drive, ended up being the easiest part. The included software transferred everything for me, I swapped the boot device, and It was done. It worked like a charm and made the process painless.Fast drive, looks good, and includes data transfer software, its a hit!

$REVIEW.: I have a antenna mounted outside, connected to a HDHomerun (converts digital OTA to a network stream used by my Linux computer) box thru about 30' of coax including a wall plate.  Before installing this amp/splitter I used a non-amplified splitter to connect the antenna to both of the antenna inputs on the HDHomerun box.  This worked okay, but the antenna had to be very precisely tuned to receive two particular stations.  Since installing this amp/splitter I don't have that problem at all.  All the stations come in clear and usable to both tuners on the HDHomerun box.  The only downside I can see with this product is it's annoying to have another wall wart converter, but I suppose it's necessary.  In summary the product is very easy to use and install and did exactly what I wanted at a reasonable price.

$review_text.: I bought this for messing around with both a Raspberry Pi and with XBMC
 It worked brilliantly for both.That got me thinking..


 I have a Logitech Revue
 Could I get it to work with that?Well, let's talk about how this thing works


 You use its software to teach it IR signals and basically map it to either regular keyboard keys (in one mode), or commands for XBMC, media center, or Boxee


 Then you plug it into whatever device you have, and that device just thinks it's a keyboard

 Programming is simple with their interface.So, it works amazingly with XBMC and Raspberry Pi


 With Logitech Revue, however, just some limited functionality - I got the arrow keys, pause, enter, and the back button to work, but nothing else


I'm hoping they add support for the Revue as it shouldn't be difficult
 No hope in hacking your own controls into it as the config file is binary.The receive range is very good.No regrets
 Love this thing.

$review_text.: I am not disappointed with the Time Capsule, but am disappointed with some of the consequences associated with having it.  First, let me say that it offers a lot more customization than most people are willing to admit.  The network settings and ability to customize your network are just as good if not better than every other router I have owned.-The USB sharing works like a champ.  I am currently sharing two hard drives and a printer from the USB port.  I don't like that the drives won't mount to the desktop, but rather just show up like a shared folder.  It works though, so I have no real complaint.-Time Machine works well, although you can't transfer a hard drive with an existing TM backup to the Time Capsule.  You have to format and start over, which sucks.-The TC is a bit noisy, but no more than the quietest hard drives I have used.  It is definitely not as noisy as a Lacie or similar.-As of right now, I cannot connect my XBOX 360 to the TC.  I suspect that this is a flaw in the XBOX wireless adapter, and not in TC.  I will try hooking up an old router in bridge mode and see if I can get it to work that way.  I have also heard that there is a Linksys Wireless-N Gaming Adapter that works both with XBOX and with Airport Extreme-It is a bit large, but looks great.  I have heard others say it gets hot, but mine hasn't become anything more than warm.-I have experienced what others say is slow performance, but I have been told that the Time Capsule regulates network traffic depending what it is, which usually only applies to Time Machine.  It won't allow Time Machine backups slow down your network, which I like.  I haven't confirmed whether this causes problems with media and other files, but I did notice that certain files were accessed faster than some, and it seemed to back up the claim regarding network control. If that makes sense...Overall, I think it is a great deal, and I would recommend it to anyone that needs NAS and a solid router.**UPDATE:  I have solved the XBOX problem.  Read the comments to see how.
$SUMMARY.: Great, with only a few exceptions...

 If I had to quibble about anything, it's a little hard to get the clamps to release when I want to stand the Nexus 7 up horizontally
 The hand strap, locatied on thr inside of the front cover is useful, but the cover does not lay flat when you fold it back to hold it vertically

Other than that, it s a perfectly acceptable solution to protecting your Nexus 7 tablet.

$REVIEW.: I bought a similar Belkin sleeve for my Kindle 2 and didn't hesitate to buy this new sleeve when I recently upgraded to a Kindle 3.  These Belkin products continue to be excellent sleeves for the Kindle: the Kindle sits snuggly inside a totally enclosed cushioned interior, yet is easily inserted into or removed from said interior.  I also like the new look; the black sleeve I selected basically remains as clean and conservative-looking as the previous version for the Kindle 2, yet now sports a little welcome visual flair.Once your Kindle is enclosed in its cozy Belkin sleeve, nothing will ever happen to it.  You can toss it in your briefcase, jam it down into your beach bag with all your other beach gear, or hold it in your hand in conjunction with a bunch of other items.  Whatever you do, your Kindle will stay clean, protected, and safe.And for all the durability and usefulness you're going to get from it, the price isn't bad, either.  To each his or her own, I guess, but I think there are plenty of more expensive sleeves and covers available for Kindle that simply don't provide as much protection as this simple yet elegant little product.  Just my two cents.

$REVIEW.: I ordered this unit after a review of how a person was slamming massive heads on this stand. I can seriously confirm this. This is not some silly background stand. It IS made of METAL, there is no aluminum anywhere on this unit. To describe the metal, it is like the metal frame of a bunk bed, or all metal bed. If you are like me, you are worried about the actual boom mechanism that you turn to rotate the boom. THIS my friends is all metal, and THICK at that. this is not some cheap plastic mechanism that can strip in a few turns if you apply something heavy on it. I can extend this badboy with my monolight and modifier on it and it will barely budge. Due to what this is made of, it just wont bend. Aluminum bends and sways in the wind. But this I promise you, will not do that unless you are truly extending it at its max which even with a basic stand people rarely do.This stand is not light though. This is not a stand I would recommend for speedlights. While you can use speedlights on this, It is made for more heavier equipment. I have small aluminum stands for those. I bought this because I have alienbees and monolights that weigh about 5-6 pounds alone without a modifier and I needed to put them on something that could hold them. This unit does it flawlessly. Now it is very expensive to find a stand that can hold a 5 pound light combined with a 5ft octobox and had my doubts with this unit due to is price but I can proudly say it can handle it. Now with this much weight, you are limited in just how far you can extend with 10-15 pounds attached but it still can handle it with no real problems. I can have this thing extended and locked and not worry about it swaying in the wind. You can tell upon applying the break-type lock that it is not going to move. I also just hang my camera bag on the back instead of the sand bag. This is just heavy enough to keep it from tipping over.I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs a very sturdy, well built stand for portrait work out in the elements.

$REVIEW.: Anything that Fails should get no stars at all. The first one I bought worked well for a month maybe. Power splitters are supposed to allow two TV's to be on at the same time. This did the job until after a storm only one side would work properly so I thought maybe the storm might have damaged the unit and I ordered another. The new unit worked as expected, for awhile and again one side of the unit started to fail without the storm. I've noticed that the less you spend for a power splitter, the sooner it quits and at 30 plus dollars for this unit, at least it lasted a bit longer than the 20 dollar one that never worked right in the first place. So I returned this second unit and ordered a 40 dollar unit. Maybe that one will last longer than a couple of weeks. If not, it'll be returned too. You get what you pay for! Too bad the people who make these things haven't got it right yet.

I move my photos off the card, back them up to other locations, and then I reformat the card in my camera


When I use rapid-fire mode (at the Tour de France or an NFL game), the only hesitation I encounter is on the camera end
The card keeps up with everything the camera throws at it...until the camera has to take a pause which is rare


The camera has two SD slots so, in addition to this 32GB Extreme card, I keep a 16GB Extreme card in the second slot (to carry duplicate hi-res JPEG photos for the RAW/NEF files that are saved onto this card

Using the two card slots this way -- with one RAW + one JPG (Hi-Res) photos saved for each click -- I can take 900 photos before one of the cards is full.

$REVIEW.: I have been paying for the fastest internet around and not getting anywhere near the speeds I wanted on my wireless stuff. Thats not the case anymore, I even checked it on a speed test site and now I score better than 90% of the US. SO I am happy with this router. Plus the free iphone app that you can get to control your network remotely is really cool too.

$REVIEW.: Replaced my first generation TiVo HD with this new Roamio


Initially I had trouble tuning HBO on my Verizon FIOS service and was informed by Verizon that I would need to contact TiVo for a firmware update but I did nothing and after a couple of weeks HBO began to work so it was obviously a FIOS issue which they corrected
Otherwise setup was easy and everything works as advertised.Most strongest recommendation for this device is for those people who can pair it with an iPad

I can watch anything that is available on my TiVo on my iPad, anywhere I am connected to WiFi
I can lookup programs on my iPad using You Tube or Netflix and by hitting one button on the iPad screen the show is on my TV

When the &#34;Watch Now&#34; button appears on the TiVo app you can watch a show right then that you were considering recording during a later air time.I am very pleased with this device and can comfortably recommend others to buy it with the only caution being that it is considering monthly service a bit pricey.


$SUMMARY.: This is my third TiVo

$REVIEW.: This hard drive has seen some hard use traveling around the world and has rock solid in performance.  The USB plug can be a little loose in the older, common ports.  I would routinely move the computer with the drive connected and found that it didn't fit as securely in some of the ports.  If you have the newer ports it doesn't matter.  If you don't, the second plug (older style) that is intended merely for power can help hold the primary one in place.

$REVIEW.: I like the flexibility and functionality of the AmazonBasics USB 7 port hub. It's just small enough to make it portable, has seven ports to fit your needs, a power adapter for when extra power is required. It supports different USB versions including 3.0. The design is basic yet good looking.The power pack is not required to use the hub, but will be needed when using several devices at once or using a device that requires more power.This hub is handy to have for either your laptop or desktop that has limited USB ports. The only drawback is that it states that it is not suitable for recharging tablets.Overall, the AmazonBasics USB hub is a solid performer with the ability to be portable (easier if you don't have to carry the extra bulk of wires/power pack though) and offers USB 3.0. If more USB ports is what you need, this hub is worth looking into.
$SUMMARY.: A small powerhouse for when you really need extra USB ports. Use with or without power adapter.

$review_text.: I own a few type of modifiers.  I do fashion photography, events, and portrait.  I use the regular gel that came with theNikon SB-700 AF Speedlightat first.  It is goo, but you get some hotspot on the face, but not bad.  then I got theGary Fong GFLSC01 LightSpherewhich is good in its own way too.  Actually if I do something within 5ft then the gary photo maybe the best for close range.  The light sphere lose it effectiveness when you get further away.  It is a power waste and a lot of image became underexpose even on the lighter setting.  The Rogue is good between 3-15 ft which is my typical range.  I anything further away you might as well shoot with the gel diffuser or bare on the speedlight, the hotspots are gone (unless somebody has a very shiny/ oily face).This is a good size, the gary fong lightsphere is huge and you have to plan for it in your camera bag.  This device is flat so it can be slipped in-between the lid of most bag, just not the small ones.  I also like that you can turn it into a snook and add a diffuser face.  This one is good size don't get its smaller brother, that is quite small.  It is kind of heavy how it is design, but if you tilt the speedlight straight up it won't fall back.  Other diffuser don't really have much weighting to pull down or forward.I will link some samples in the comment line so you can see for yourself.
$review_summary.: works very well for portrait, better then gary fong lightsphere in a way

The original died on me a while back and I never even though of coming to Amazon to get a new one till recently.  I was very happy to find this one for the price.  I really love the fact that now I also have an actual charger where I can charge one while I use the other one.

$REVIEW.: Quality radio! SSB is great! Listening to ham transmissions as I type. Sync Det works well. The unit is a joy to use and handel.You cant go wrong with this kit.  you will enjoy it!To the reviewer who says "dont make the hundred dollar mistake" is kidding himself and readers. You are not going to find a radio with SSB and Sync detection for under 100 bucks. You get what you pay for. The Tecsun pl 660 looks like a good unit with similar features if you want to save a few bucks.enjoy surfing the shortwave bands!**Update I ended up purchasing the PL 660 as well as the Sony (for backup, plus I like radios.)Couple of things I've noticed about the Tecsun:-The tuning wheel is nice but the novelty quickly wears off. Plus if you are handling the radio you will definately bump the wheel and switch stations. Happens almost every time. It is very annoying!!-The sync detection works much better on the Sony. The Tecsun's sync is less effective and makes a LOUD squeal when it loses its "lock" and another loud squeal when it finally "locks" back in.-2000 channel memory is overkill, never going to use it. Plus it's not as intuitive as the Sony's memory interface.-Build quality is good on the 660 but the Sony has the edge for sure.-Buttons on the 660 are recessed making them hard to find and requires deliberate pressure.-The 660 has a built in charger and comes with batteries. However, the supplied batteries only have a 1000mah capacity so they dont last long. The unit's ability to charge the batteries internally is a great concept but in reality, charging batteries in series will not give each cell an even charge. If you want to use rechargables and do it right, you will need to invest in a set of Eneloops and a good smart charger.I hope this helps in your decision if you are chosing between the 2. I am not loyal to Sony in any way, but if I had to choose between the two, I would pick the Sony by a large margine

$review_text.: I was weary about buying a Toshiba because my father has a satellite that is junker (although its AMD based, go figure).However based on the specs and other reviews I decided to pick this baby up.I cant say I'm disappointed at all.Build Quality -The entire computer is built out of plastic, however it doesnt feel cheap or flimsy, its a good quality of plastic and feels really solid.The paint and texture have a nice feel and dont attract finger prints which is good.The screen assembly is pretty solid, the hinges are sturdy and appear they will last a good while if taken care of.The Fusion X2 finish is nice, most gaming laptops come with very obnoxious designs and bright and annoying colors and lights everywhere.The Qosmio however has a nice sleek and elegant paint job, the red accents are shiny and chrome-like but not too shiny. it just feels like a more grown-up laptop compared to the previous gen Qosmios.Keyboard-I really really like the keyboard, there is barely any flex at all, even if you push hard, it feels nice and sturdy. The keys are very nice, tactile, and quiet - they feel great while typing.The backlighting is fantastic, evenly lit across every key, with just the right amount of brightness. More keyboards need to be like this one.My only concern was that that space bar is shorter in length that most standard keyboards, so I found myself pressing the right alt key sometimes when trying to press the spacebar. It's just a matter of getting used to it.Also, having the full numeric keypad on the keyboard is really nice as well. I thought I wouldn't use it initially but I actually use it quite a bit.A note to buyers about the keyboard - the backlighting settings have to be changed in the BIOS, which is kind of annoying but at least they're there.It can be set to be always on, off, or on a timer which you can set. I set mine to turn the back lighting off after 30 seconds of inactivity.Screen-The screen is not terrible, but it definitely could be better. The colors dont pop out like most HD screen do, and the overall picture quality comes across as bland. You can fiddle around with the intel graphics settings to get it looking a little better though.Also when you look closely at the screen, especially in areas where there are solid bright colors (red, white, green, ect) you can see the tiny lines in the LCD panel which can be off putting at times.The viewing angle is kind of bad too, while looking dead on, the top left/right corners get dark. Then if you angle it to eliminate that, the bottom get washed out. It only looks perfect if you view from a distance and head on - which is fine for watching movies but not much else.1600x900 res is OKAY, but it really should have been a 1080p screen to go along with the other specs of this laptop. I would have gladly payed another 100$ or so for that option.Hardware-This thing is a powerhouse, a GTX560 card with an i7 CPU cannot be beat. It has run every game I've thrown at it so far on nearly maximum settings.Tons of hard drive space, it has a total of 1TB of space, with two drives. However I am confused as to why they did not include a RAID controller with this setup. Most other gaming computers that come with two drives come in RAID 0, however this did not, and I do not see any BIOS settings to enable it, so I'm assuming that it just doesn't have the ability to do RAID.Having a blu-ray drive is awesome too, now I can bring my movies anywhere instead of just watching them on my PS3.Touchpad-The included touchpad is a synaptics device, and it shares the texture with the rest of the palm rest, which at times can be easy to lose your finger on the edges because it feels the same - again just another thing to get used to, its not really that bad.It's decently sized, supports multitouch scrolling and gestures, and works well enough.The left and right click buttons feel cheap and the clicking noise they make really loud for some reason.There is an illuminated LED strip at the top of the pad which makes it easy to find in the dark.Sound-The Harman/Kardon speakers are pretty good, the subwoofer actually works pretty well, you can really hear and feel the bass coming out of it.The overall volume of the laptop doesnt get super loud (dont plan on it being able to entertain a party with music) and it desperately needs an equalizer - there doesnt seem to be any kind of extra sound software included.Overall though, its really good for a laptop, you can watch movies and play games and you dont have to turn it up much passed 1/3.Battery Life-Like the other reviews said, it's bad. No getting around it.Just in the time I've taking to write this review it's gone down 40%. There's no way you can watch a full movie or try to play a game without it being plugged in, which is a shame. However you can get a good hour or so of just basic stuff like web browsing if you need to.Considering how powerful this laptop is - its not surprising. Just dont plan on using it without an outlet nearby.Fan and Heat-While doing basic things (browsing, chatting, videos) it stays perfectly cool and quiet.Under heavy gaming load, it still stays fairly cool. Only the area right around the vent on the left side gets hot, the keyboard, palm rest, and touchpad never get uncomfortable.The fan is surprisingly quiet considering how effectively it cools the system, I'm impressed.Other thoughts-Being a 17" laptop, this thing is pretty big, however it still remains fairly portable. I wrote this whole review sitting in bed without it plugged into anything and Its been comfortable. For true portability I would stick with a 15.6" laptop, but 17" isnt bad at all.I wish it had a slot-loading drive instead of a tray CD drive.If it had a better screen, RAID 0, and better battery life, it would get 5/5 stars.

$REVIEW.: With today's thin LED TV's, the HDMI inputs are usually located on the side of the TV close to the edge.  In an effort to dress the cables I purchased 4 of these to make a 180 degree turn so the HDMI cable would not stick out on the end,Well, both new TV's, one Panasonic and one Samsung, have the direction of the HDMI plug reversed and these adapters will not even plug in.Make sure you have your new TV before you buy these adapters to make sure they will even work.  I ended up going to my local Radio Shack and buying the correct 90 degree adapters.

But even more impressive - and this now seems to go for all the WD portable drives targeted at Mac users - these drives are housed in a solid metal case. Overall construction of these drives is very good and designed to last.With the USB 3.0 connection, these drives are fairly fast... as fast as you can expect from a 5400 rpm portable drive.

$REVIEW.: It wasn't until I purchased a Blu-ray player (Sony PS3) and Epson Cinelite 1080P projector when I realized I needed to purchase a new receiver.  I was looking for something I could connect all my game consoles (PS3, XBox360, Wii), my Mac Pro, and my Karaoke system.I first bought the lower-modelOnkyo TX-SR506(then later returned... keep reading to find out why), thinking it had all the inputs I needed and HDMI output for my requirements.  Since this review is for the TX-SR606, I won't go into too much detail on the features of the TX-SR506.  However, since I'm sure some of you will be comparing the SR506 to the SR606, I will quickly tell you what the TX-SR506 LACKS that may help you determine whether or not these missing features are necessary for your application.  The SR506's HDMI ports are video pass-through only, meaning it does not carry Audio signals with it.  Next, the SR506 will only output video to the same medium as the video signal it receives so if you have equipment using different types of connections, it has to use that same type of connection as an output from the receiver (e.g. component video input can only be displayed using the component video output, composite in to composite out, hdmi in to hdmi out, etc...).  No coversion of video inputs to another type of output will be performed.  So expect to have multiple cables output to your LCD/plasma/TV/projector's video inputs.  Finally, only 4 total video devices can be plugged into the SR506 at any given time... yes, I know the photo of the SR506 shows an abundance of inputs but you can only program one input type (HDMI, component, S-Video, or composite) for each of the four video inputs (DVD, CBL/SAT, AUX, VCR/DVR).Now enter the TX-SR606, full of the features that the TX-SR506 lacks!  Both the SR506 and SR606 do an impressive job in ease of setup and sound output quality but that's pretty much where the similarities end.  The FOUR HDMI inputs (yes, an impressive FOUR inputs over the SR506's TWO) of the TX-SR606 also carries digital audio signals.  This keeps the optical/TOSLink/digital-coax digital audio inputs free for devices you may have that do not have HDMI audio -- another major flaw I found with the TX-SR506 when I had it (since it didn't carry audio through HDMI, I had to resort to using up both optical audio inputs for my PS3 and XBox 360 and had none left for the optical audio output from my Mac Pro and my Karaoke system).Next must have feature about the SR606 is that all non-HD video inputs (going into the component, s-video, or composite inputs) are automatically upconverted so you can view everything using the HDMI output.  The upconversion of these non-HD devices is upconverted to 1080i.  1080P upconversion would have been nicer but look at the affordable price on this unit!  If you really need the 1080P upconversion, consider theOnkyo TX-SR706model -- which will set you back another $200+ but is THX-Certified.  And quite honestly, when you take a 480i/480p signal and upconvert it, you won't see too much of a difference between upconverting it to 1080i or 1080P (alright I know that statement is open for the screen size vs. viewing distance debate but remember your source signal is 480i/480p to begin with).  Even if the upconversion feature isn't really a necessary feature for the size of your screen, the fact it processes and converts non-HDMI video inputs to be displayed with the HDMI output means you only need one cable going to your LCD/plasma/TV/projector and you can keep the TV on just one of its input modes (no more switching from Input1 to Input2 to Input3 when going from DVD to game console to Tivo/DVR).With the SR606, you can customize all the video source inputs and audio source inputs to suit just about any setup needs you may have.  For example, I have the video and audio for my PS3 and XBox 360 going into the HDMI input ports on this receiver (this unit has an impressive 4 HDMI 1.3a input ports) so I set up the receiver so that it knows to process video and audio signals for my first two devices through the HDMI port.  My Mac Pro's secondary video (primary video is plugged into my 30" computer LCD screen) is plugged into the 3rd HDMI input on the SR606 receiver using a DVI-to-HDMI cable to provide full 1080P output and the audio is plugged into the SR606's optical/TOSLink digital audio input.  I then have it programmed in the receiver so that it knows to process video from the HDMI3 input and audio from the optical1 input for the third device.  Finally, the video for my Wii is plugged in to the component 1 input and my Karaoke machine is plugged in to the component 2 input while audio for the Wii is plugged into the standard 2-channel RCA-style input and optical 2 input for the Karaoke machine.  Again, you can mix and match your audio and video any way you like and just tell the SR606 how you have it set up.  It's very flexible.  And the Wii and Karaoke gets upconverted to 1080i through the HDMI output while the PS3, XBox 360, and Mac Pro maintains its 1080P resolution via the HDMI inputs.Since it's upconverting the video signal from your non-HDMI video devices (component, s-video, composite), you will see the volume level on your screen when adjusting volume for these devices. This leads me to the only gripe I really have about the SR606.  If your device uses one of the HDMI video inputs, the receiver will not display the volume level on your tv/lcd/plasma/projector so you'll have to just look at the LCD display on the receiver itself for that information.  This, however, does not warrant any deductions in my rating for this feature-filled receiver.Another thing worth mentioning about this receiver (that you may have already gathered from reading the product's technical details section here on Amazon) is that it has a TrueHD and DTS-HD decoder for the ultimate in 7.1 HD surround sound quality offered in many of today's Blu-ray movies!  Isn't Blu-ray one of the reasons you're looking at this receiver in the first place? :)  Impressive feature to have in a receiver at this price point!  Now is the price difference between the TX-SR506 and this TX-SR606 really starting to look more and more worth your while!?  Go ahead and close that TX-SR506 product window/tab now and add this TX-SR606 to your shopping cart.  You won't regret it.Overall, at its attractive price point and the rich-list of features it offers, the Onkyo TX-SR606 easily deserves the full 5 stars!  Check out my other reviews and you'll see that I don't just easily give out five stars to stuff I own!
$SUMMARY.: Feature-PACKED for the price!

$review_text.: Being a few years older than the average MP3 buyer gave me an advantage when I began researching these products.  I wasn't embarassed to ask pointed consumer questions and not afraid to comparison shop.  I asked hard questions many of which the store people could not answer.  I wanted to know if I could edit my playlists from the computer and I wanted to know if I needed a degree in engineering to make it do the things I was looking for.Well...the Nomad does everything I wanted and more.  If you can use Word or any windows program it is a cinch to get this thing running.  Just put a CD in your computer and in two clicks you are "ripping" the entire CD to the Nomad.  I had to learn a few new terms but in about an hour I was telling my teenagers a few things they didn't know.  The on CD manual is a bit awkward to navigate but not impossible.  Make sure you go into settings and turn on the CDDB.  That way [if you have an internet connection, DSL preferred] even the track titles automatically are entered.You can rip an entire CD in about 2 minutes [Pentium 4].  One bit of advice, load everything into playlists or albums or you'll end up with a lot of stray tracks.  Sort of like saving a whole bunch of Word documents not in a file folder.The sound is great and the battery charge lasts for hours.  I'm sure I could put 4000 songs on this thing.  I will never fill it up.  Interesting after only a few days I was getting sick of certain songs and deleting some.  But you don't have to there is so much space on the 20 GB drive.Well worth the money.

$review_text.: Went through three different a/b/g wireless access points over the last two years.  All three would drop signals, have varying signal strengths, and worst of all, needed to constantly be reset.  Time to upgrade to dual band.  Compared the Netgear to the Asus and went with the Netgear for the simplicity.  Both are great wifi routers, but I didn't want to fidget and tweak settings to optimize the Asus.  This Netgear worked out of the box. Didn't need the manual (other than to figure out why some lights were white or amber) because the web interface was straightforward.  Devices discovered, do you want to allow or block? Simple. Even worked after the simple firmware upgrade!  Old devices on the normal speed wireless network, newer devices on both the normal and high speed network, and wired devices on the gigabit cat6.Best of all, not a single dropped connection and never had to reset this router yet!  Love it.

$review_text.: Ok so I purchased this Roku because it was on sale, and I figured since it was the &#34;elite&#34; version that it would be worth my investment

I did research prior to purchasing the device, and the 600 + channels that are available is the reason I decided to pull the trigger and purchase it.So why three stars? I will tell you why


This device does what every other device in existence does: it streams Netflix and Vudu movies


I think that consumers should know that if you are expecting high-end content from this device that you will be disappointed
One of the few channels that I was interested in, and one of the reasons I bought the Roku, is Crackle
Sure it has commercials, but on the whole it is a good station

This is where great content ends.Don't get me wrong


This device works well and I have never had streaming issues


As an incentive to buy it also streams Amazon Prime content, which is great if you have the Prime membership
However, in my expierence, the vast amount of content that this device streams is very retro


Sure, if you love old movies and commercials from the 1900's-1950's then this device is for you


 Also, if you love B movies and, in some cases even worse (I dub them &#34;C&#34; movies) then by all means purchase the device
Another good reason to own the device is if you speak a multitude of foreign languages as the Roku offers tons of Bollywood content
But, if you are like me, and all you want is a cable alternative, DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE.So three stars


The device works wonderfully well and has a simple interface

The fact that it streams from Amazon is most of the reason it even has three stars
But five stars? No way
Not until they give me a true cable alternative and not 150 channels of religious programming.I hope this has been helpful

I am not trying to discourage anyone from purchasing the Roku
The above review is just my personal opinion on the device and what I personally expected it to do.Thank You.

$REVIEW.: As others have stated, this device is USB 1.1, which makes it extraordinarily slow


I bought this since my daughter stuck a pencil in the ethernet port on my notebook
I usually use wireless so this isnt too much of a problem

However, I needed to transfer about 400-500 gigabytes of media to a NAS (Network Storage)
I figured it would be more stable, and also quicker to go over wires

I was shocked to see the maximum speed it would transfer with this device is around 300-400kb per second, compared to about 10mb per second with an onboard NICWhat year is this again, 1999?

$review_text.: These headphones are awesome in many different ways! First, they sound great!  There is a very full range of sound.  The bass is powerful and the highs are crisp.  These headphones are also very lightweight compared to similar models.  The &#34;around ear&#34; fitting is extremely comfortable, but it makes for some big looking headphones.  Although your outer ears will never get sore from wearing these, you will not be able to lay down on your side with these headphones.  These headphones also have a very long chord.  It was nice having a chord longer than 3 feet at first, but this chord has proven to be more of a pain than an advantage.  It gets tangled and caught in things all the time and the chord isnt that thick so I worry about how long it will last (Although it has lasted a year so far).Overall I am very satisfied with these headphones and I would recommend them over all other headphones under the $50 range.

$REVIEW.: I bought this hard drive to go together with my BlackX Docking station, and boy, was I pleased!!! It's fast, quiet, doesn't get too hot and reliable. Yes, it's an OEM so it doesn't come with any cables, screws or drivers but that's no problem if you're using it as an internal or external as you can pick up cables cheaply. For the month I've been using it so far, it's worked quite solidly. It's a SATA II spec so if you're using it as an internal drive, watch out to see what your motherboard supports. I don't think it will be a problem using it in combination with something else as an external drive.Hitachi once again delivers and I've grown to trust Hitachi drives over the years. I think I'll be picking up a few more in the not too distant future as the price of $74.99 seems to be the lowest for a 1TB drive. Remember it's about 75 a gigabyte. Great buy!!!

$review_text.: A lot has been written about how great the Macbook Air is. I agree, this is a truly fine thing. Forget the &#34;feeds and speeds&#34; metrics so many people seize on (although the performance is pretty good on this for what most people do), I just feel that this thing is in total harmony with me. It is powerful yet light and agile. I have a 13&#34; Macbook Pro and it is great but a bit heavy. The Macbook Air is insanely light and yet very sturdy.The one thing I really stressed over was whether to get the 11.6 inch model or the 13 inch model. Years ago I had an early netbook. It was nice as a novelty but it was really underpowered. It turned out the 10 inch screen was just too small. The size of the screen on the netbook was just too much of a compromise (my eyesight isn't what it used to be!). I was concerned that the 11.6 inch Macbook Air screen might be too small also. I really wanted to get it instead of the 13 inch screen because to me, getting a larger Macbook Air just seemed to defeat the purpose of getting a small, light computer in the first place. I really wanted the 11.6 inch model to work out. The price difference really wasn't an issue, I just wanted to have the perfect size for me. I saw a few 11.6 and 13 inch models and I thought the 11.6 inch would be okay but I had the nagging feeling that when I started using it, I would regret getting the smaller version. You know how that goes, your first look at something is brief and you don't really get a feel for how you will use it in the real world. Sometimes your initial conclusions turn out wrong and you regret your choice. Well, I took a chance on the 11.6 inch version and after using it for a while, I am really happy with the choice. It is the perfect size for me for a portable computer. If you are struggling with the same decision, I hope this helps.

When we attempted to place the cover on the laptop it was cut about an inch too small. We tried everything but it did not fit. If the bottom part could fit it would cover some of the key components to the sides of the computer like your earphone plug in, CD insert, memory card insert, and battery reset button. Do not waste your time buying as you will have to return this product. The technical specs says "this case fits a Macbook Pro with no DVD drive".  If your new MacBook has no DVD drive that is the MacBook Air. This does not fit the new MacBook Pro with Retina. Back in the return box it goes.

$REVIEW.: I've had one of these for five days now, and I really love it
 I have been able to stream off my cell phone left in the bedroom, while I take this speaker into the bathroom, and it sounds great, however, judging by some of the other reviews, my experience with the bluetooth reception may not be typical


 I haven't tried taking it into the shower, because I don't want to push my luck with it or get shocked


 Anyways, I digress
 The sound is superb for a little portable speaker
 It feels solidly built when I hold it in my hand, and even more solid when I hold it while a song with good bass is playing

 I've been using it every night and sometimes during the day, every day for five days without a charge, and it's showing no signs of having a dead battery yet

 I also appreciate the multi-function buttons that control power, play/pause, volume, and skip forward/back; letting me choose to control from my device or the speaker is very convenient

 My only complaint is about the pricing
 I think all of the colors she be the same price, and since they were not, I went with the cheapest, which was black.

$REVIEW.: I bought this tripod because my other tripod was very unsteady and the legs kept collapsing.  Sunpak 8001UT is more than steady, it is solid.  In fact, it is more heavy duty than I need for my tiny camcorders and cameras.  And it's lots bigger than my other tripod.  I can't just put it in my purse or backpack.  I have to lug it around.  Still, when I need a tripod, this one is the reliable one.The quick-release mounting plate means I can pick up my camcorder quickly when needed.  There's a second mounting plate included, so I can quickly mount a second unit.  Very easy to use.The bubble levels are useful for getting the camcorder or cameras straight.  Nice to have something like that included.There are an infinite number of adjustments I can make to get my camera just so, from the height of the legs to the tilt and swivel of the camera.  The center column will also extend to give a very nice height.  I'm 5'5" and I don't need to bend over when the tripod is extended.This is a terrific tripod.  For its size, it is lightweight.  I guess it really isn't that big for a professional photographer.  For a person who owns tiny camcorders and cameras who just wants something steady and reliable, I wish it were smaller; but then it may not work so beautifully.________________UPDATE 3/28/2014: I'm still using the Sunpak tripod.  At one point, the head broke.  I don't know what the kids did with the screws but it wouldn't adjust anymore.  Sunpak stood by its product and send me a replacement, no problem.  I didn't have to provide documentation or send anything back.  It was hassle free.

$REVIEW.: I bought this as a refurb for $300
 Three VERY important things to perhaps save you a lot of time and grief.1


 Mine did not come with a dvi to vga adapter

 This item is a must to set it up with your computer monitor as Acer had disabled the VGA port on the back of the computer


This computer came with no manual and the online pdf I found was useless.2
 Setting up hdmi from the computer to hdmi on my tv for the video portion was easy

 BUT getting the sound from the TV was a nightmame

 Since I am not computer savvy I tried all the adjustments for sound on the TV and even DirecTv but what you have to do is go into sound via control panel and then highlight the Realtek Digital Output - click on properties and under support formats check the Microsoft WMA Pro Audio - under sample rates I checked both 44.1 khzs and 48.0 khz

 This worked for me.3
 It does not come with a wifi card
 However it works excellent hardwired into your router

 I did, however, buy a linksys usb wireless adapter that I am having problems with - not sure if it is the adapter or the Acer or some sort of incompatibility with Vista - just don't know.

 The moral?  It may not work with your digital input, but if it does, you will be happy
 This solution allowed me to avoid a ground loop I was encountering when I plugged my VCRs (VHS and BETA) into my TV and attempted to connect the TV audio out to one of the analog inputs on my receiver

$review_text.: Back in November, I got my hands on the Timex Run Trainer and I've been using it everyday since then. And not just for its functionality as a GPS-enabled fitness watch but as an everyday watch as well. So now I've got over five months of experience of using this and I want to provide an update to the previous review, which was only based on having it for about a week.DISLIKES:I still think the watch is literally huge and at least 20%-25% of size could easily be shaved off to make something less unwieldy. Again, my Garmin FR210 has 90% of the same software functions and is half as large. Just to give you an idea of the size difference, I can easily fit the FR210 on top of the TRT no problems.  If they make a 2012 or 2013 version of this watch, they need to seriously shrink it down. Size aside, the weight is hardly noticeable once you wear it after a while, I hardly ever notice it on my wrist unless it gets caught on something because it's so damned large; I can barely put my motorcycle jacket on without either taking the watch off or undoing the cuffs to their largest diameter first. But enough about its mammoth girth.This thing seriously needs a new strap design. The stiff rubber doesn't conform to any wrist shape I've ever seen in my entire life, but it's perfectly round enough to fit around a bottle with no issue. Conversely, the Garmin FR910XT makes use of an ingenious design: make one arm of the strap swing freely like an actual watchband. Imagine that, a technology company using a piece of design tech from a regular watch, something Timex has made since 1854. Seeing this literally blows my mind, they got scooped at their own game. I cannot decide if Timex designed the Run Trainer to fit bicycle bars or bottles, but it wasn't made for a human wrist, that's for sure.Indiglo still sucks horribly but I've learned when to use it most effectively. It's truly only useful well into the night, it's pointless at or around dusk. Fiddling with the contrast helps some but I still firmly believe that a color inversion on the display would work better, something Suunto has done with success. The actual brightness has taken some getting used to as well, but it's usable. Not great but not bad, but not really good either. It's there, so you use it or you don't.While its functionality is still designed by engineers -- you can tell a UI or UX designer never came close to touching this thing -- getting acclimated to how it works does not take very long, especially if you read the manual. It still has operational or design quirks that I think would have been normal 5 years ago but should never occur today (e.g. all sensors stay on until you manually turn them off, I don't know of any fitness watch that doesn't turn those functions off after X minutes). Luckily, this is 100% fixable through a firmware update but getting Timex to actually fix that is another point altogether. Their support on their Facebook page is extremely responsive but does not always follow through.To get the data off the watch, you have to use Training Peaks' Device Agent, which isn't bad, but it's another engineer-designed app, just like their website. It's all about getting data in front of your eyeballs, regardless of format or how it looks. Besides the fact that TrainingPeaks' website is god awful confusing for most people to use, locking users into using it is a very poor choice, especially for first time users. I'm not saying Timex or TP should debut a site as easy to use as Garmin Connect, but they do need to make strides to make the site (and software) far more usable for those users that aren't high-level athletes with coaches. Or they need to do something else: allow easy export (in part or whole) of your data into a .FIT file or similar file format. I've searched their forums and tried everything in TP's site but there's no easy way to export your data to any other service such as Garmin Connect, RunKeeper, Endomondo, or anything else. Instead, you have to rely on exporting the .PWX.GZ file generated by the Timex Run Trainer and then using a 3rd party site to convert to .FIT, .KML or another format for use on other services, which tends to not be the most reliable data output you'll get. These results tend to be hit-and-miss at best, with data points getting dropped, munged, or other data left out altogether. The worst fun part about this is you have to export each workout data set one-by-one and TrainingPeaks have no plans to offer any type of mass export. They want to keep your data in their analytics package and do not want to let you have data portability. And if you want any type of advanced analytics, you have to pay for their premium package, all to get the same results from other services that offer it for free. While this isn't necessarily a problem with Timex, it is their problem in that they only allow you to have one single data output format and analytics dashboard, but the other problem lies with TrainingPeaks to make getting your data out of their walled garden difficult, much to the dismay of their own users. I have a feeling this partnership came to fruition because Timex has a share in TrainingPeaks and making sure its use grows. Companies need to realize, as end users, we like choice and options to view our data and forcing us to use a single application to view that data is not a wise decision. If I'm paying over $200 for the Timex Run Trainer, the least they could do is pair it with a free year of premium TrainingPeaks access -- I realize there is a "special" Timex-branded dashboard account you can get but it only offers up a few free training plans (all of which are only useful for marathoners or triathletes) and one or two extra analytics options, none of which is any use to me. The upside to getting the branded dashboard is that it removes TP's annoying ads.If you like using a footpod, just get yourself a Forerunner 210 or a much more expensive watch. For whatever reason, Timex decided that if you use both the GPS and a footpod at the same time, the watch needs to trust the footpod over the GPS for distance and speed data. That's right: it uses the footpod over the GPS...BY DESIGN. That's great if you're running on a treadmill but then, you don't even use the GPS anyway, you're inside. Every other watch will combine the data from both to give even more accurate results or will switch over to the footpod for distance and speed when there is weak or no GPS signal. With the Timex Run Trainer, you get the choice of using the GPS or the footpod, not both. Timex designed it this way on purpose, which is why I've never even synced my footpod with the watch.The watch has different activity modes for stuff like walking, hiking, running, cross-training, and so on. But the manual doesn't talk about them at all so there's no explanation of why these modes are there, why you can configure them, or if they calculate the data slightly differently. The only reason I can see for them being in the watch is so that when you import the data to TrainingPeaks, it can be automatically color-coded for that particular activity. Other than that, I've found literally no difference in how `run' and `crosstrain' are used or calculated. They could excise this "feature" altogether and use the extra bits to make the backlight time out configurable.Honestly, most of my complaints 5 months down the road in owning this are almost identical to the ones I had after using it for a week. I'm used to them now, but that doesn't make them any less annoying or boneheaded. If Timex doesn't fix such rather simple issues in their next iteration of a GPS-based watch, they should seriously consider not making them any longer. This is a crowded field and is getting more crowded by the year, and while Timex has only made two GPS watches (three if you count the soon-to-be released Marathon GPS T5K638 which removes HRM functionality), they're getting beaten by everyone else, including the Soleus 1.0 which is the first GPS-based watch from Soleus and pretty much everyone loves it. If Timex is getting beat by someone as small as Soleus, they have little chance of stealing market share from Garmin or people armed with smartphones and Wahoo Bluetooth dongles.LIKES:After my first week of using the watch, I hated the mushy, crappy buttons. Well, my mind has changed a little over time, but only a little. I still hate the mushy feedback and the fact that I hit them randomly from time-to-time with the back of my hand, but I've come to enjoy the feel of them. They're huge buttons, that's a definite plus. The mushy action does help prevent accidental presses sometimes but doesn't always succeed, it's a very mixed bag. But this mushiness is a champ when you're slogging through a mud run or heavy rain and the waterproof rubber under those buttons keeps the watch running. Timex gets an A for the idea, B- for effort. They could have rubberized the outside of the buttons and made them 100% waterproof with a really good functional amount of button travel. Maybe in the future. Perhaps they'll poach some of Garmins design engineers to do this since they've done it for a few generations now.Last time, I thought the backlight timeout was too short and by default, it is. But I recently discovered that if you hold the INDIGLO button down until it beeps three times in succession, the backlight stays on. WIN! On every night run I do, I leave the light on the entire time now. I just wish it mentioned this in the manual. By measure, you need to hold down the INDIGLO button for about 8 seconds before it beeps three times.I can now say that this thing is certainly water-resistant to 50 meters just like it says. Between a million showers (both in rain and in my bathroom), gallons of sweat, some beer, gobs of mud, and even slogging through saltwater, this thing hasn't quit and died on me from water exposure. Even when I press those mushy buttons covered in mud, they still function and my watch continues to live. Although, a thorough cleaning of the watch after any activity involving something other than water or sweat is highly advised. So far, it's built tougher than I am. The thick plastic face doesn't hurt either, it's extremely well sealed on my watch.I know the watch is huge but the biggest upside to that is you get huge numbers on that display. During a run, I have my heart rate displayed in the middle on a 3-line display and there's no mistaking or mis-reading the numbers because they're huge. I would say that in a 3-line configuration, the middle data display is approximately one-half inch, absolutely HUGE compared to other watches. Definite plus. This large face translates well to running a 4-line display as well and I use that as my main display during non-running workout sessions. If I could configure it to a 2-line display, I probably would.Certainly lending to its large size and tough outer plastic face, this thing is built tough. I've slammed it countless times against counter tops, bars, barbells, my kettlebell, and other tough surfaces and the body itself shows little to no signs of wear. Let's just say I think it's built like a plastic tank, tough but by no means indestructible. When I ran the Georgia Spartan Sprint a week ago, my watch face finally fell victim to a massive 400 foot long mud crawl, it's now covered in scratches. The face is still readable but the plastic is no longer shiny and scratch-free, but matted and dull. Granted, I think just about any other watch would have given up the ghost, but the Timex Run Trainer is still working. Now I just hope getting a new screen replacement is easy.I love, love, love the EAT and DRINK timers because, well, they're super helpful. When I use them, I have them set up for every 15 minutes or so because I know in a 5k race, that will be about the same time we hit the first water/aid station so I can train in a nearly identical atmosphere to an actual race (they're useless in an obstacle course race though unless you have a hydration belt or pack). But I've also used them as alert timers for doing drills such as push-ups or dive bombers during runs, just to kick things up a notch. Really, not much to talk about here since it's just a timer that goes off at an interval you set.ConclusionsNow that I've used this watch nearly everyday for almost 5 months straight, I've got a considerable amount of experience with it, as you can see. I've used this watch as both my daily to-wear watch and for every exercise I've done since I got it, the only time it has left my wrist was either to charge or after cleaning it from race-related debris. While it's not the most fashion-forward watch, it's not a garish eye sore either. The watch is in a tough field with a ton of choices and for the price, it does everything $400-plus watches do at half the cost, which is a definite plus. But the real question is this: would I ever recommend it to my friends as their first GPS-enabled fitness watch?NoI'd just tell them to get a Forerunner 210. Why? Now, I love the fact that I get most of the functionality from Timex's own Global Trainer and Garmin's 400, 600, and 910XT series for under $250USD, but there are drawbacks. It's rather confusing and daunting to use at first and I think that even my technology-savvy programmer friends would find this tough to use. It's built-to-last but that makes it big, bulky, and ugly and ill-fitting. I know for a fact that this thing will last me a year's worth of swimming and mud crawls before it dies unless I do something stupid with it first. INDIGLO could be great, but it's not, it's 20 year old technology that functions like it did 20 years ago. The display could use some design enhancements (ref: Suunto's new Ambit, its display is gorgeous) but it's infinitely more readable than others on the market. Once you get used to TrainingPeaks and how it works, it provides an excellent way to analyze your workout data, just don't expect to use that data in RunKeeper. If this watch were Timex's first foray into the GPS-enabled watch world, I'd say they did a good enough job and have a very stable platform to build on but since this is now their second watch released since 2010, this second generation watch should have been a vast improvement over the Global Trainer rather than acting as an incremental upgrade at a lower cost (albeit, minus much more advanced features as well). If they want to stay in this market, they're going to have to really step up their game to come close to gaining traction.Right now, I've got my complaints but the Timex Run Trainer serves nearly all of my needs without fail and until something super-ridiculous-amazing comes out to replace it (from any company), I'll keep using it because its function in obstacle course racing is unparalleled in its price range.

$REVIEW.: If you have a full-size case you'll definitely want to go for the Cooler Master EVO, but this works good for my home theater PC.  I can't quite overclock with it (using all 4/8 cores with Handbrake eventually crashes the machine), but it's worked well in just about every other instance with a 10% overclocked i7-3820. Low-profile coolers for LGA 2011 are hard to find - I ran an EVO for a few months until Cooler Master released this rev of the GeminII - and while the EVO kept things cooler, this is a very respectable replacement and, more importantly fits well in a smaller case.  Highly recommended... I only gave it 4 stars because it doesn't cool quite as well as it's other Cooler Master brethren... but again, the best for a LGA 2011 HTPC application.

$review_text.: I really love how these sound. They really have the signature Sennheiser sound that I like but it being a closed set really feels cramped compared to my HD558. I'm not saying that it cannot show the direction or the separation of the sounds but it is noticably more congested that an open pair. Even though it has a low impedance, I still find that it sounds better with some amping just to liven up the sound a bit.I would have wanted some bigger earcups maybe at least the size of the Sony MDR-1R or the ATH-M50 but portability would surely suffer. They are still comfortable even after long periods of listening (around 2-5 hours straight) but they could have been better in terms of comfort if they were just a bit bigger.Overall, I have yet to find a set that would match the robustness and sound that these give. I really love this set and I have no plans to change them in the foreseeable future.

$review_text.: I was specially looking for a non-smart TV just for gaming and I picked this one. There seems to be a few problems with Samsung Smart TV's freezing up and I did not need that option anyway. If you are looking for a smart TV, I would recommend buying a Roku with this TV. You can't go wrong for the price since it is a 1080 TV. Also this is not a true 120hz TV, only in cinema mode and I did not see any difference in gaming and I am not using gaming mode since this TV seems fast enough. This TV is also a gloss finish which makes the picture more crisp! Once thing I noticed playing Battlefield 4 on my new Samsung and LG TV, that there is a certain map that has a cave and I can actually see with the Toshiba inside the cave and the LG and Samsung I could not, so I always hated playing that map till nowThe colors are nice and crisp and there is no delay in the response time with the controller. I am using a HDMI connection and did a few adjustments on the colors from a previous review someone did. Amazon can't seem to keep this TV in stock, so I had to buy it from a different dealer. The only thing I did add was buy aPhilips CSS2123B/F7 SoundBar Home Cinema Speakersfor added gaming experience, otherwise it sounds pretty good with the built in speakers. The TV is also very light and can be easily moved around and it also has a VESA mount for mounting on the wall.
$SUMMARY.: Awesome TV for PS3 and PS4!

$review_text.: This iPod is so small it can be taken anywhere and not even noticed.  It has excellent audio and video quality and the interface is good.  Coverflow is fairly pointless, but the classic controls work well.  The battery life is amazing if you are listening to audio, but abysmal with video.  I can barely eke out two hours on video playback.  This one problem makes me wish for something more...plus iTunes delivers purchased video at 640X480, without the option to scale down to the pixel density of the player, allowing you to cram more video onto an already cramped storage space.

$review_text.: This is a very good headset and is really worth the price.  I've had problems with other brands that have lousy or mediocre sound, just don't feel right and wind up a little too loose or uncomfortably tight but these adjust easily and fit comfortably (on my head, anyway).- A really neat thing is the volume control on the right earphone - you control the SYSTEM volume, not just the sound into the headphones. It's easy to use: just press the top or the bottom of the earpiece to increase or decrease the volume. You don't have to look at it or feel around for it.- An equalizer switch in the left headphone has three positions: telephone, game, and music to alter the sound for whatever function you're using. They work well and do make Skype clearer and give music a wider rage. Haven't tried it with games - I'm not a gamer.- It's a one-cord headset with the cord coming out of the right headphone only - big plus for me because I really hate the inconvenience/discomfort of a double cord plus it gives you a little more freedom of movement.- The noise cancelling boom mike can rotate up out of the way and works fine - it even has a little light on it so you know when it's live (you can mute it with by pressing the center of the right earpiece).I'm very pleased.  This is a good buy.
$SUMMARY.: I'm Very Happy With  This.

$review_text.: I wouldn't go so far as to call myself an audiophile and I don't know many technical audio terms, however I do find that I am not so easily satisfied or fooled by mediocre sound quality as much as most people (I can't stand to listen to any Beats by Dre products). So I can say that, for what this product is, and for what it does, it is nothing short of amazing. Yes, these are still relatively expensive, but think about what you are getting. This is a 2.1 system that truly sounds like 5.1 surround sound. The way that these speakers bounce audio off the walls will make it sound like something is behind you when it's meant to be. I've had other people say that I've wasted my money (I bought this years ago at $750), then show me their true 5.1 or 7.1 surround systems that they bought for a couple hundred less. In the beginning I listened to their sets and I thought to myself, &#34;wow, their less expensive system sounds just as good as mine, maybe they're right.&#34; Then the voice of reason inside my head chimed up and said, &#34;hey stupid, you only have 2 speakers and a sub, which makes it super easy for cable and speaker management, while they need to physically place multiple speakers all around the room and have wires running everywhere, and don't forget about their extra receiver/amplifier.&#34; What you pay for with this system is compactness (wow that's really a word) and the ultra style/innovation that is Bose, without sacrificing big theater sound. You will not get any distortion by turning it up loud (well as loud as I can handle anyway, which is a bit less than really loud). There is a dial on the back of the spectacular Acoustimass Module (subwoofer) which I have to keep at half or less because the bass has too much boom for me and I feel like I will break it. I did, however, do a little stress test, by turning the subwoofer up to full and the volume almost to full and listening to it for a while (while covering my ears). Then I returned it to normal room filling volume and noticed that there was no lack in quality of sound or audible indication of damage. After years of using this system, I still get really immersed in the action while watching epic 3D blu-ray movies like the Avengers or Man of Steel. Listening to high quality music with these speakers also gives me the same feeling of immersion, just like breathing in an atmosphere of audio greatness. All in all, you get what you pay for, which in this case is not a bad thing.
$SUMMARY.: over 3 years, still sounds amazing!

$REVIEW.: I bought this card and have been using it to paly BF4 and Call of Duty Ghosts.  All this talk of loud noise and high heat is misleading to say the least.  Fan boys I guess just angry they paid so much money for their choice in graphic cards.  This is running with a Gibabyte 990FXA UDE and a FX6350 overclocked to 4.4.  The card is overclocked to 1100 core and 1300 memory.  It works super good with very high FPS.  I saw all the negative videos of it sounding like a jet engine, lol.  That's just scare tactics by someone.  Loudest I got the card was under benchmark tests with no audio from computer and I didn't seem to think it made more noice then my water cooling fan, or power supply when it cranked up to add a little power.  Its running in a mid tower Corsair gaming case.  Yea it gives off some heat, but not as much as the &#34;hot air&#34; trying to degrade it, lol.  Its the most amazing deal I have seen in 10 years of gaming.  Of course the non reference cards might have better cooling solutions down the road, but don't put off a good thing.  Not once have I had a crash, blue screen, red screen or anything while playing the aforementioned games on super high settings.  Relax green team, you might someday get a first class card at an affordable price, lol.

Also, sometimes it won't get detected by the USB ports or say that this a USB 1.1 device and could not find any drivers for it.  Removing and reinserting the device seems to fix the problem, but is a bit of a hassle.  I think the problem is the retractable technology.  I'll probably not buy a device which is retractable.

$REVIEW.: I bought this for my kids at three hundred. I though they would like to have a table and leave my iPad alone. But now they use my iPad more than before and I use this little gadget. These are my comments:1 .Lots of errors with Android. Hopefully this will upgrade to Ice Cream and be more stable, but Android is still a buggy and slow OS. I had the launcher error and had to replace it, otherwise the tablet was unusable2. Had random restarts, not so often and not a big deal. I am used to restart windows anyways3. Apps still lack. Now with Amazon, more apps are available, but not as many as iPad, that's why my kids don't give up Apple products4. Compared to my iPad, it is slower. Videos show ghosting and sometimes is unresponsive. Apps crash often5. Synch tool is a joke.  Not a lot of options and it doesn't work for me now.6. Wifi is not as good7. It is a good tables if you get it cheap, but you may be tech savvy to get the most of it and avoid frustrating issuesSpend your money on an iPad and let this to go lower, it is not worth the current price.

$REVIEW.: I ordered this product only a few days ago - the day my Macbook Pro fell out of my backpack. Being on my back, that makes it about a 4 foot fall. It landed on a corner. The case scuffed and bent, but did not break. The Macbook did not go entirely unharmed, however, there is a small but visible bend on the corner of the aluminum body as well as a white scuff where it landed. I can only imagine how much worse it would have been without the case, but the case does not 100% save the Macbook from damage.The case fits well and looks fine. The keyboard protector is useless, so I threw it away. Since the air vents are on the spine of the MBP, I don't really see the need to have the excessive vents on the bottom of the case. (This is only stylistic choice, not important)I have never owned any other sort of case, so I have nothing to compare this case to. Only writing from a few days experience, in which my MBP still took a small amount of damage with a fall.

$review_text.: AWESOME!Really thats the only word I need to describe it. I'm running a MacBookPro8,1 (15" i5 2.4Ghz) that comes standard with 4GB of RAM. After kicking off 2 virtual machines for my work, it became quickly apparent that 4GB is not enough RAM. A little bit of researching and I found Komputerbay 16GB of RAM for a stunning price. A little bit more research, and I found that MacBookPro8,1 *may* support 16GB of RAM, though Apple will tell you otherwise. With that said, I jumped in.RAM arrived fast, quick swap, and then ran memtest+ overnight to make sure the RAM was not going to cause any issues. the 10+ hour tests finished without issue. And I've been a happy user ever since. I've even recommended the RAM upgrade to friends & colleagues who are currently running 4GB.

$review_text.: When you're deciding if you want this, you're going to have to think about how skilled you currently are at applying screen protectors and how much little bubbles being left behind will bother you.This is a really good option for people who aren't already good at applying screen protectors, and who just want to get one on without a lot of trouble or fuss. You do pay a premium for that, but if you'd otherwise be spending a long time messing around trying to get a different screen protector absolutely perfect, going this way does work well and the extra money is worth it.If I needed another screen protector in the future there's still a chance I'd go with another brand personally, because I've had practice getting the other types (both wet and static) on and I've already gone through the painful part of figuring out how to get them on pretty well so things look nice. (Though, if I happened to be in a lazy mood, I might just go ahead and jump on them anyway.)On the other hand, if a friend or family member comes to me saying they need a Kindle Fire and a screen protector for it, I'd probably point them to this. The fit is good, the clarity is good, it goes on easy, and it can be removed and cleaned if needed. For a typical person who doesn't have a ton of experience dealing with the fussier styles of screen protector, the extra money is well worth it for how much this simplifies things.

If the cover was taught (like the pictures on Amazon's and Marware's web sites) I would have liked it.  The interior material is fine and the material on the back is fine too.  The fake leather on the front looks pretty fake.  For the price, fake leather is fine.  But I just can't use something with such poor quality, even if someone gave it to me for free.  I'm sending it back.The overall design is good.  The clip attachment is nice.  I very much dislike full enclosure (i.e., sliding in a frame) or the bungy-cord type holders.  If Marware can improve the quality, it would be a nice product.

As expected for L lenses, it is nice and sharp with quick and silent focus


As an added bonus, this lens is nice and discreet compared to the much larger, white 70-200.The only reason I'd caution against this lens is if you need the flexibily of a zoom lens for your particular use case

Unfortunately, Belkin has changed the design and I didn't like the new version.  I looked for awhile to find something similar and this fits the bill perfectly.  The armband is flexible and would fit most arm circumferences.  The silicone fits like a glove over the iPod and protects it nicely.  You can remove the armband and still have the silicone sleeve on if you want to carry the iPod around.  It comes with a sheet of protective "screen saver" material.  You can then cut it to fit which portion (or all of) the iPod you want to cover.  There are several patterns to follow, based on how much you want.  I would highly recommend this if you want to wear your iPod on your arm while exercising.

$REVIEW.: Through the use of iPad/iTouch Bluetooth and an app called, "StreamToMe", I have made my entire mp3 collection accessible from my home computer; all accessible to be my entertainment center using touch screen control of an iPad/iTouch sitting comfortably on my couch.No more sync; no more connecting the computer to the entertainment system; I fire up the Bluetooth iPad/iTouch interface and sync to the cradle adapter; fire up the PC in the other room, and "wallah" a wifi-like SONOS solution for under 20 bucks!I couldn't be happier!!!!!ONE CAVEAT TO MENTION: this adapter does not work with digital chargers like the Panasonic SA-BT330. Keep this in mind when putting together your finger-tip accessible mp3 collection solution together with this tool.
$SUMMARY.: I finally completed my ultimate Frankenpod entertainment center with this device!!!

$review_text.: So here are some questions you need to ask before you buy these headphones...1) Are you an audiophile, i.e

obsessed with perfect sounding audio.If yes, don't buy these


Actually don't buy ANY bluetooth headphones

You will be dissapointed.However, if you're a normal person, that generally listens to 128-256kbps MP3s, you're gonna love the sound quality
They're better than any bluetooth headphones I've ever had (granted thats not that many) but I can't hear too much of a difference between these and mySony MDR-EX56LP/BLK EX Style Headphones - Hybrid Silicone Type Earbuds (Black).2) Are your ears exceptionally large or small?If yes (or even if you're not sure) you should try out a pair of sony ear buds (in-ear, like the ones mentioned above) before buying these
While the little rubber pieces are not the same (the hole in these are bigger so you can't use the nubs from standard sony ear buds) they seem to be approximately the same 3 sizes

So if the normal sony earbuds don't fit very well, neither will these
And you NEED these to fit well

They're way heavier than normal ear buds (after all, they crammed a lot of tech into a very small space) so if they don't fit well, they will fall out of your ear


For me, the large size fits oh-so-perfectly.3) Do your devices support bluetooth well?There are a bunch of reports on these forums about certain iPhones not working well with these buds

I can neither confirm or deny those, but I pair these with mySamsung I9250 Galaxy Nexus 16GB (Unlocked)and myApple MacBook Air MC965LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop (NEWEST VERSION)and they work perfectly


I can even walk like 20 to 30 feet away and still get really good sound from themGripes:I can't really blame this on the earbuds themselves (I think it's a limitation of bluetooth itself) but if you want to switch devices, you have to re-pair the ear buds every time

If you're only using a single device, this isn't a problem.Overall:I F$%#ING LOVE THESE THINGS! And as long as they fit well, and you're not overly obsessed with audio quality, you will too :)Caveat:I did not buy these through amazon, I went directly to J&R; in NYC instead


I cannot comment on the buds coming from this seller.

$review_text.: The player has been plagued with problems since about 3 months after purchasing.  Brand new DVD's freeze up during playback and the system frequently will refuse to eject the DVD's.  Stay away from this unit.  The worst move Panasonic has made is not providing adequate support/replacements for these systems.

$review_text.: The good:I got this SSD to be my boot drive and installed it in my cpu with no problems.  Windows 7 went on without a hitch.  It increased my windows experience index for hard drive, ram and processor and it seems very fast.  The packaging was very good and the build quality seems very solid.  With a newer main board capable of sata 6 it would be great.  Customer service promptly answered my call with almost no hold time and they spoke good english!Now for the bad:I get random BSOD (blue screen of death error screen) since installing.  After the BSOD the BIOS does not recognize the SSD in the hardware.  In order for it to work again the computer needs to power completely off then back on, reset does not work. Apparently there is a known issue with the Sandforce SF-2281 SSD Controller which runs the drive.  Sandforce has apparently released a firmware fix for the issue (version 3.3.2) but Kingston has not updated the firmware for the drive yet.  I spoke with customer service at Kingston and was told that a firmware update is in the works and should be live within two weeks or so. (update) Kingston released an update for the firmware and so far it seems to have fixed my problem!  I will upgrade the review to a 4.The adventure:Take a picture of the label of any product you install in your computer so you do not need to remove it to find info.  Kingston requires a number off the drive itself, not just the box to get support.  Would be nice if they put a sticker with that info on it in the box also.  I have a tech support e-mail sent in and will update once I hear from them.  A note on their website letting customers know about the issue and informing us they are working on it with an ETA would have saved hours and hours of wasted time troubleshooting.

$review_text.: I've been using the iTrip for a while and it definitely is an improvement over past FM transmitters that I've used.  The cord length does the job and is long enough to allow me to keep the cord docked in my center console in the car.  This is nice as I can easily throw the cord back into the console when it's not in use.I have to say that the tune scan is pretty much worthless however.  I let it try to pick out 3 stations that would work and all three were pretty miserable in quality.  That being said, I had much better luck just tuning my radio to the the low end frequencies until I got static and using that station.  There was a little bit of practice to get the exact right station but once I got it, it was worth it.  There's a little bit of hiss but then again, it's FM radio.  Unless the manufacturers can pump up the amps on these things, I'm sure we're always going to have some hissing.  At least I can find a small zone where there is no radio playing to I can listen to my iPhone.  (yes, it works with my iPhone just fine)

$review_text.: You can find fifty thousand mouses out there but only a few trackballs and Logitech sells most of them. I guess they are not big sellers compared to the mouse even though they are way easier to use so companies don't want to make them. It seems like Logitech is dedicated to the trackball loyalist which makes me happy since other than Kensington nobody else is. The problem with that is you don't get much competition and so you have to wait longer for better models to come out. It took a couple of years but Logitech finally came out with something better.This model is nice because it takes a previous good item and makes it better, not much better but just enough. This model has the same shape and feel as the Trackman but they added two more buttons which doesn't seem like anything but I always missed the amount of buttons I had on my Microsoft Explorer trackball (those were the days). The only thing that I can criticize is that it needs to be a little heavier so it doesn't move around so easily on the desk other than that I'm very happy with it.
$SUMMARY.: Starved trackball fans are happy.

This pack works perfectly with both!One note, while the USB ports are labeled according to output each tablet preferred a different port even though they are both supposed to need 2.1ma so you might have to mix and match ports with certain devices.I must say it's nicer than I expected and appears well made and comes with a pouch and power tips for most needs.

$REVIEW.: Here is the original review with 1-star:--------------------------------------------------Extreeeeeeeeemly Slow! Drives Me Crazy!=======================================Purchased it for the purpose of storing multimedia (Video and Photo) files. My computer and the router are both Gigabit devices. However the transfer speed always around only 1MB per second! Such speed make it impossible to watch video! I purchased two devices: One is for myself usage and the other is for my brother as a gift.BTW, For all the Seagate's replies to comments, None of the link they provided works out! I always got the message: "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found". What the hell is this?----------------------------------------------------Now I found I was wrong: Actually due to the mismatch driver of my network card it only performs at 10Mbit/sec. After downloaded updated driver from the PC motherboard's manufacturer, the network bandwidth becomes 1Gbit/sec and the transfer rate become over 50MB/sec (equal to 400Mbit/sec), same as the USB 3.0 dock station (I purchased it to replace the low-speed network dock station).The lesson I took is, before complaining to the product's quality, check the system's configuration to make sure the system's performance meets the product's requirements.Now I am very satisfied to this product. I give it 5-star.

Luckily, there are a few used ones that are in good shape and offer all the features you need.  In the bright sun in AL, the LCD screens wash out to the point they are worthless.

$REVIEW.: Updated March 2011.I've owned this product for about 2 1/2 - 3 years now and have been pretty disappointed with it. When used with my sharp L lenses, the quality would drop drastically and I always assumed it was just the poor quality of this adapter. Turns out that was only half true. The problem was that this adapter was so poorly calibrated, that it was throwing off the focus when paired with my lenses (giving  an out of focus, blurred image). Because of that, I rarely every used this adapter - I actually had better luck just cropping as needed to get that extra reach.2011 comes along and I now have a 7D - turns out the problem wasn't that the adapter is horrible, but rather it needed to be calibrated. With the 7D's Micro AF adjustment, I was able to dial it in (+13) to the point it produces a VERY sharp image with my lenses. The downside is I can't use it on my XTi or 40D cameras still, as those don't offer Micro AF adjustment.Besides the above, the downsides here are the price (about 300-500 bucks, depending if you get the "II" or "III" version), the fact it loses 1 stop (so f/2.8 is now f/4.. f/4 is 5.6, etc..) and the fact it only works with select lenses. Note that the 2.0x extended loses 2 stops (so f/2.8 lenses become a f/5.6) and that if the widest aperture goes below f/5.6 most bodies will NOT autofocus (so using a 70-200mm f/4L IS lens with a 2.0x adapter, you will lose autofocus. Same with using an already-f/5.6 lens with this 1.4x adapter). SOME of the pro-bodies will allow autofocus still.The 3rd-party versions aren't the same quality level as the canon, but work with ALL lenses (so you can put it on your 50mm prime and make it a 70mm prime), the canon versions don't. The 3rd party versions are cheaper as well.  For the somewhat high price of this adapter, it would be nice to have more compatibility, but I can see Canon wanting it to only work with some of their more "Pro" lenses to ensure a higher quality.If you only own 1 "L" lens, it's a somewhat harder sell as the adapter can easily be a good percentage of the price your lens cost.

$REVIEW.: Not too long ago Sony had only one Dream System, and it was more than enough power for around 450-bucks. Then, I think they realized they were giving away too much for too little. I bought two of them, and they are almost as powerful as the bigger Dream System available nowadays. After listening to this one in the store, I was horrified at the lack of depth and tinny sound coming out of this piece of crap. It is an abomination compared to the last version.The 'bigger one' on the other hand, is a sound to behold. I installed one for a friends parents (April '05), and we watched Empire Strikes Back as our maiden voyage. It is without a doubt, unbelievable.I watched my friends in utter joy, exclaiming that they "thought they were satisfied" with the Bose system that they had been using, and is (by the way) five times as expensive. Tweeter Store won't carry the Sony Dream System, and I actually got the greasy salesman to admit it was because they were'nt expensive enough and had plenty of sound.

$REVIEW.: This camera is very easy to install on a Windows-based computer, as it is a Microsoft product.  Therefore, the installation disk wasn't necessary and the system recognized the device when I inserted the wire into the USB port.  The driver was installed fairly quickly and the camera was ready to use.The installation software was automatically pulled from Microsoft's web-site and launched quickly.  The only thing I needed to do was click yes on the agreement.  I did not try to install this on my MAC as it already has a built in camera so I am not sure how easy the installation would be for that device.The LifeCam software was ready to use but it did not install a desk ICON so it needed to be launched from the Start menu.  The camera itself is black which matched the color of my system (my other Windows computer is silver).  The camera itself attaches to the top of the screen using a bendible strip for the back of the screen and a tab to hold the front of the screen.  My only complaint with this is that my screen is round in the back (my other screen is straight in the back) so the bendible strip could not get a snug fit with the tab.  This is readily fixed with a small piece of two-sided tape.  Once mounted the camera looks good with the screen.The picture quality of the camera is above average and it is able to let you view video on the screen with no time lag.  The quality of the picture camera is ok for this type of device, almost as good as the cameras on the new smart phones.Overall, a good buy for the money.

$review_text.: ....I purchased a pair of SE425 ear buds to replace a set of Shure e4c earbuds that died a premature death from wire insulation "rot" thinking that the replaceable cords would solve the problem.  Well they do, but there is another problem inherent in the design that is not readily apparent....until you try to replace the sleeves with new ones.  With my pair, the sleeves(only had them for 5 weeks)had become fused to the stems. So upon trying to remove them following the instructions in the manual, the stems snapped off!!!  Well, with e4c buds they are replaceable but with the SE425 buds the stems are an integral part of the earbud and are NOT replaceable.  My suggestion to those who purchase these is that the 1st thing you do when you get them is to try to swap out the sleeves sometime before the Amazon 30 day return policy expires.  Hopefully the 2 year warranty will save the day for me.  I will keep you posted!OK.... its 2/24/11 and I got my replacements already from Shure.  Great turn-around! Raised the star value up to a 4 from a 1.  They sound great but I am still disappointed in the fact that the stems are not replaceable.  Although the sleeves remove easier on this pair, I would guess that this will happen again sometime in the future.  Maybe with the next generation of earbuds, they will get it right.  Would I buy them again?  Yep! I like them that much!

Would all come back if the wires were wiggled just right
Headphones themselves are quite comfortable
As long as I don't have issues returning, I would actually like to try another pair..

hopefully get a better pair, and of course I will review the product and update then

Comfort wise..


very good; heck, my ears are now a little 'chilly' with them off

$review_text.: Previously I owned Sony DSC F717 which was best in class back then and it still performs well, within its limits. So I would be making few comparisons along the way when necessary.Let me cover the points which matters to me the most in this cameraFocus - I use spot focusing 99% of the time and its very accurate and rarely misses a shot. It can even lock on a subject with ease in challenging backgrounds.View finder - While the focus is great, the view finder isn't the best i've seen. For most part of my shooting, I find it sufficient but on some situations its not so great.For example, when I trying to shoot a grey & black striped dragon fly sitting on a fungus infested wall, I could see where it was with my naked eye but through the view finder it was very hard to locate it. But then I was just barely able to see it with naked eye.Also when shooting very bright subject, when shutter is half pressed the Red focus spot lighting up is barely visible but I work around this by checking the green spot which confirms focus which is clearly visible in the view finder.OVF vs EVF - My previous camera had EVF which is very handy in direct sun light to check for focus on the images I just shot. So I will miss it in bright sunny conditions but I think I can manage by increasing lcd screen brightness in Nikon.Focus points -  I just use the center spot metering most of the time, so I dont really care much about 11 points vs 36 points etc.Kit Lens - The kit lens is pretty good. It can do superb macro @55mm and is sharp at that focal length. The VRll is really effective in low light conditions where the shutter speed drops below 1/30.I bought 35/1.8, assuming it will perform significantly better than the kit lens and the difference wasn't that big as the kit lens held its own which I never expected to happen.I tested by setting the 18-55 lens to 35mm and shot few pics of some flowers, distant objects etc. I did the same with the 35 mm/1.8 @ same aperture values and then compared them. The first thing to notice is the 18-55 gives you more in-focus shots which I believe is due to the VRll. The 35/1.8 looked ok on normal viewing but when looked at 100%, its just not so great and 18-55 won more times.Even in low light situations, where the 1.8 aperture was supposed to perform better than the kit lens, it could not match what the VRll function could do at much slower shutter speeds.There were photos where 35/1.8 had lesser noise in the out of focus areas but the kit lens had more in focus shots which I think matters the most.Not to mention the chromatic aberration when wide open in high contrast scenes which is not so with the kit lens, probably due to the smaller aperture than the 35mm lens.However when I can get higher shutter speeds (good light), the 35/1.8 gets better and with small apertures (over 5) it gets sharper than kit lens and picks up more finer details than the kit lens.For portraits, I found 35mm @2.8 was sharp enough with pleasing results.In low light, using a tripod gave impressive results with 35/1.8, which proved the kit lens's VR function gives it the edge in low light for hand held shots.Also the kit lens allowed for a much closer distance with the subject than the 35/1.8The 35/1.8 was much better than kit lens for indoor video, where it has no noticeable noise indoors while you can see some noise with the 18-55 lens. The clarity also seemed better in video with the 35/1.8.But then I may have very few situations where I go to the extent of switching the lens for a short video clip.Just buy with the 18-55 kit lens which makes it super light and comfortable to use. If you want to upgrade, go for 18-140mm which will give better range with very similar image quality and doesn't cost much. Get the 35/1.8 for price/performance and it can get some great shots in good light and some good ones in low light.White Balance - This camera has the standard options for its class and the auto white balance is good enough to cover most situations. However when I did want to preset manually, I noticed it took about 10 seconds or so to get it done via the menus. The same could be done in 3to 4 seconds on my 8 year old Sony camera (DSC F717) as it has a direct button to set white balance manually. I just have to find anything that's white and big enough to cover most of the frame and press that button and its set for that light. But with Nikon the same process takes much longer which discourages me to use that option often. However the auto white balance on Nikon is far superior to the old Sony I have.Strangely the auto mode on Nikon seems to be more accurate than the manual setting in it.ISO performance - For viewing pictures at normal size, even ISO 6400 is easily usable. But if you are going to crop at 100%, then better to stay around 800 and less. Overall I'm impressed with the ISO performance. Combined with the VRll of the kit lens, it covers you for most situations except long range.Shutter Lag - For moving subjects it was a bit of hit or miss as I found tracking birds, sqirrils etc (at close range) in moderate light was hard. Every time I locked focus and clicked on, only some shots were in focus, the rest were like the subject is blurred or the nearest background was in focus. I found this odd to happen when using spot focusing. As for the shutter lag, I did find the subjects were little off the center off the frame in the picture. So I may need to lock focus and guess ahead on where the subject is going to move and click. I may need more time to find the best way to do this on this camera. However when there was ample light, the focusing was as fast as I need it to be to get birds in flight.Direct controls - After reading tons of reviews, I was worried I may be taking too much risk on the direct controls not being available. That was not the case for my shooting style. I shoot Aperture mode, manual mode or no-flash mode 90% of the time, so I need shutter speed, aperture and ISO control to be adjusted fast and this camera allows me to do just that. However for exposure setting,I have to press the "i" and adjust it in the shooting menu which may be more easily accessible in expensive models. But I seldom use the exposure compensation as adjusting shutter and aperture gives me the exposure I need. The 'Fn' button can be reassigned and its assigned for ISO function by default which I use the most when in Aperture or Manual mode.Video: Good video clarity which maxes at 50fps@1080p but it picks up the lens sound. So adding a external mic will solve that. I use an old mic which came with the Home theater receiver for room calibration which works in mono mode but does the job.Memory cards - I have tried using three of them so far (Sandisk extreme pro, Sandisk extreme plus, Lexar Platinum ll SDHC Class 10). For normal uses all of them seemed to do their job but when I shot continuous shots with RAW+Jpeg output, I could notice lag with the Lexar by 3 to 4 seconds but barely noticeable with the Sandisk cards.Battery - Lasted more than 3 days in one charge for moderate use everyday (1-2 hrs with heavy LCD use for reviewing every picture shot). But the indicator icon is not accurate in showing the exact status. When it showed around 25% (approx) remaining, I just switched to live view to do a video clip and comes the message to charge battery and it wont let me shoot anything. The battery was still showing around 25% available.RAW vs JPEG - Raw converted using view NX2 has slightly better quality than the JEPG fine.In camera Raw conversion - This is just a gimmick. It does not offer any better quality than the JPEG fine setting output. Use View NX2 for better result which comes free with the camera. There are lot more applications out there which specialize in photo editing but I have not spent my time on those yet (except photoshop)View NX2 - This is bundled with the camera and does RAW conversion and some basic editing. This suits my need just fine and doesnt need a very powerful computer to run. I'm using it on my 6 year old computer.Image quality - The default settings on the camera suits my needs just fine. Dynamic range is impressive for a camera in its class. Surely its better than canon rebel series.I set the picture type to Neutral which seems to have more accurate colors.Compared to Canon - Canon may have better video and cheaper lenses but when its comes to ultimate IQ and dynamic range, Nikon wins (in respective category). I have used Canon EOS 550D, 1100d and briefly the 70D (which is another class)Compared to Pentax - Pentax may offer penta prism view finder and more direct controls but it increases the weight of the camera. Also the lens collection sucks in India for Pentax. So I went with Nikon and no regrets so far.Compared to other mirrorless cameras - They may do better video but when it comes to lens collection to choose from, overall cost etc. Nikon seemed to be a better choice.My choice was largely influenced by the sensor performance plus the lens range in offering.One more thing I do miss big time compared to mirrorless is the live rendering of the actual output before we shoot. This makes is so easy to adjust the exposure and to adjust all I need to do it point the focus point into a darker area in the scene to over expose and if I focus on a brighter area it will underexpose to compensate. All this is done in few seconds without messing around with buttons.Live view shooting is too slow, so I dont bother with it.3300 does hunt in very low light for focus. For example, I tried to shoot an owl that was about 10 meters away (which ive never seen around my home until then) in moon light and the camera just would not focus. I'm sure this could be the case with many SLRs. So which other camera is capable of getting a focus on this situation ?My 8 year old Sony which fires a laser pattern when shutter is half pressed, that allows the camera to get enough contrast to lock focus and then fires the flash to get the right exposure on the shot.With the nikon, I had to use manual focusing which took few trial and error. But this is a very rare situation to be in.Some mirrorless options may offer much better shooting experience with wifi, touch screen etc which may be more important for some but for me the end output matters the most, which Nikon delivers in spades.************************************************************************************Updates as of 7 July 2014The flash Performance is quite uneven. Some shots casts a slight shadow around 1/3 of the area covered in the frame (tested on a indoor b'day party). I believe one of the other reviewers mentioned this too.The kit lens sometimes struggles to hit the correct focus in very bright and direct sunlight @55mm. I tried some macro shots more than once in such conditions and almost all shots had the subject  a bit too soft for my liking. I will continue to try this and update my findings.Overall, I continue to find the VR on the kit lens to be very effective when compared to the non VR 35/1.8 lens. This allows me to get more successful shots when lighting isnt very optimal.Using the lenses in their effective range will yield excellent results. For example, the 35/1.8 is super sharp above f4.5. It also has better contrast compared to the kit lens.

$review_text.: So far this device has worked great and plan to order additional units


 We used it from out Blackmagic ATEM 1 M/E HD-SDI Aux Output and 100ft of RG-59 cable


 We pushed 720p video to it where it was converted to HDMI and shown on a rear projector for a 3 day conference


 The device was powered up pretty much 4 days straight, 24 hours a day.The only downside is if you change the input signal to it sometimes you have to power cycle the converter, which for us means climbing behind screens and pulling and re-inserting the power cord
 But small inconvenience for the cost savings.

$review_text.: Based on some reviews I had my concerns that the fit in ear would be bad

As I am Germany I might just have German Ears, but this set fits me perfect

I had many of the noise canceling headsets and always was a huge fan of Sennheiser


This proofed to me again if you want the best by Sennheiser, don't even waste your time with anything and I mean ANYTHING else.I had AudioTech both the US and JP editions, tried the Sony's, Bose, Shure and Panasonic
At the end I broke down and bought this, worth EVERY PENNY! Fantastic fit, Superb sound


They are pricy, but so are Shure and Bose and these sound better, take up way less space and are just quality wise the leader of the pack.I travel a lot to Asia and spend often 9 - 14 hours on long-haul flights, these are the only ones that do not make you ears hurt, feel funky or make you ears sweat (why I gave up on my Bose's)


Next time I will try Sennheiser first, like I have always done in the past instead of experimenting at the end that is cheaper.I LOVE THESE, the best in-ear headphones in all categories.

$REVIEW.: REVIEW UPDATE:  Found a HUGE dealbreaker for me in regards to this monitor that may not apply to some people, but I figured it should be listed.  When this monitor goes into standby mode, its large LED power button blinks on and off.  You CAN NOT turn off this feature, I even asked LG.  You can turn off the power button light itself, but when it goes into standby, the light goes back to blinking.  Sure it's a soft glow you say but try that in a completely dark room with two of these monitors and it gets old quick.  It's an absolute shame because I really like this monitor and this is my second try to find one that I'm happy with, but if I can't sleep while these sleep, it's a no go for me. I can't go without mentioning my opinion that LG knows how to make a beautiful picture, but whoever decided that a large blinking light was an acceptable behavior for a monitor in standby is an idiot.  It makes no sense. (End update, see below for original review)When I write reviews I try to write about things that other reviewers haven't, so I'll only quickly state that this monitor has a beautiful and deep picture.  I had two LED monitors before this from Dell and although they certainly seemed nice (Dell has great sturdy monitors by the way), the LED display made the colors almost too vivid, and even though people seem to get excited about a bright monitor, LED monitors are a little TOO bright for me.  Using one of my old monitors next to this LG LCD showed me that I really don't justify the sense in an LED monitor unless you really enjoy the picture more.  For me, it was painful to look at, whereas this monitor is soothing.  Having said that, my main TV is an LED TV and it's great, so don't rule out LED's altogether.  This monitor seemed to have the best picture out of all the monitors I saw at Best Buy, and is very easy on the eyes, with colors actually looking natural.  Also, compared to the LED models of LG's line-up, this monitor uses tactile buttons, which I STRONGLY prefer over the touch-sensitive buttons that only work half the time.  Something else to consider if your heart is set on LG.This monitor will maintain aspect ratio to play 4:3 games which my brand new Dell LED's did not, which was the main factor for the switch.  Yes, the stand is a little wobbly compared to others, and it gets worse the bigger you go.  The 20 inch 40 series don't really have the problem, the 22's here have it a little more, and the 23's are obviously the worst.  I have no problem with it since mine is stationary, but if you're constantly adjusting your monitor, you might.  It's among the most wobbly stands I've seen in every monitor I've looked at (a lot).Lastly and maybe the most controversial is energy efficiency.  I compared the wattage draw on this against my Dell 20 inch LED.  This one pulls 27 watts, wheres the 20" Dell LED pulls 19 watts.  Yes, that is a difference and for those really bent on energy consumption, hopefully those figures will help you.  However, the HP 2010i is Energy Star Qualified and it pulls 28 watts.  This LG is not qualified and yet it pulls less.  I don't entirely understand, but for those wary about it not being Energy Star Qualified, as I was, I wouldn't worry much given the figures I observed.  Two of these is still less than a 60W bulb.  If you do the research, the annual cost difference between all of these monitors never gets above a few dollars, anyway.  Hope this review helps and adds some insight in other areas of your search.

First if fall off ALL THE TIME
It's very unprofessional to have it fall off and roll across the floor while shooting
Next thing I don't really like is how it cause about 3 stops of light loss

That being said, it does create a nice soft effect and helps when shooting portrait orientation with the flash pointed up
I still prefer a bracket though.

$review_text.: I bought this with the intentions of returning since i already owned the Sound link II, but just wanted to give it a spin. First impressions were it's tiny, about the same size as the Jamobox mini, was expecting something much bigger.I plugged it in, and the first word out my mouth was WTH? (in a good way), i wasn't expecting that much bass. Build quality is great like all Bose products, and it has a heavy but premium feel ( Think apple products ). The battery can be replaced as well as firmware upgraded to support future Bluetooth devices so Bose engineered this to be a bit future proof.Now those thinking how does it compare to the Soundlink II. Believe it or not, the bass response from mini is almost identical to that of the Soundlink II in terms of frequency response and depth. The Soundlink II is obviously larger and heavier which reduces its portability over the Mini ( Though it is still very portable).The Sounlink II plays louder, and the highs are clearer. Now the mini can get pretty loud too but the Soundlink II would be better for group listening and small parties. Haven't been able to test the battery but so far seems much better than the Soundlink II, 2 hours on low volume and its still showing green.I've had many bluetooth speakers in the past and haven't been able to find one that offered acceptable build and sound quality. People complain about the price, but having tested others you get what you pay for and i am completely happy with the performance/price combination.I like it more than Soundlink II, so i'm actually keeping it. Will use this to travel and the Soundlink II as a backup or if i need to really get loud.Suggested Improvements:Because of the below i give it 4 1/2 stars, however since amazon doesn't have a half rating and the issues below are minor, ill give a 5.* Sound link two has a slight tilt so that the sound is directed more towards the users ears. The mini faces flat. The stand it comes with is also flat. I notice if i tilt the mini at a 25 degree angle the sound is a bit clearer.* USB Charging would nice, though i can understand why the Soundlink II cant as it has a huge battery and would take forever to charge through USB, however i feel the mini should have this feature.Happy buying!

However, the Docking station is just that...it's an area to put your ipod. It doesn't charge it. Also, it does NOT sync with the ipod's alarm. We tried the way of the directions. I tried to "trick" the iHome. but nothing worked. IF the ipod is plugged into the iHome, you will NOT get an alarm, but you will be able to use the iHome as a speaker. We tested it a number of times and got the same results. And the iHome alarm itself is so quiet, my daughter is glad she had me as her backup alarm the next morning. By itself...it's a good, not great, radio and clock. But as far as alarms go...don't waste your money.

$review_text.: This is a nice cover. The front is covered in the grey woven fabric, the spine is leather, and the inside is black flocked velvet. There is a strip of elastic that you can wrap around the back of the kindle to hold the cover closed. It works very well. To get the kindle into the cover, it snaps into a plastic frame. The cover works great when it's in the stand-up pose for watching videos. The only thing I dislike about the cover is that it doesn't fold back very well for reading books. The front and back cover are both very hard so that it will stand up, but the places where it folds aren't convenient for book reading. It sort of bulges awkwardly. Perhaps over time it will crease in the right place if one reads enough. So I'd rate this a cover for video watchers more than readers.*I received this product from the Amazon Vine program in exchange for an honest review.

$REVIEW.: Some time ago I went shopping for a set of decent headphones of relatively good quality, preferably less than a hundred dollars. I tested a wide assortment of headphones and ended up being quite satisfied with my purchase . . . or so I thought until I compared them with the Pioneer SE-A 1000 stereo headphones. Not to downgrade the other brand, which I will not mention, but the difference was phenomenal. I think I've now found a set of headphones that will last a lifetime while providing that a high fidelity mellow tone that will blow me away every time I use them.M-e-l-l-o-w was the very first word that came out of another family member's mouth when I asked what he thought about the SE-A 1000. I'm now convinced that the extra money anyone spends on these headphones in exchange for an impressive experience is the way to go. If you want quality, you simply have to pay for it.FEATURES:++ A free-adjusting faux leather headband with a soft interior that rests lightly on the head, allowing the user to wear it for extended periods of time. Think "one size fits all" . . . no more awkward adjustments.++ The "open-style design" won't restrain the sound.++ A soft, jersey type cushioned material on the inside of the headphones allows your ears to breathe . . . they won't stick to your ears like many sets do. The will also enable you to wear them for longer periods of time without any discomfort. They also help eliminate outside noise with 1.2" padding.++ An EXTRA long 19.6" (6m) cord that will allow you to travel around a room or use in a large room.++ A slim, classy looking braided cloth cord adds to the durability of the headphones. Included is a wide velcro strap that will shorten the length of the cord, providing an added measure of safety and convenience. The cord is light weight and when it is coiled and strapped up it does not pull on your ears provided the coil is closer to the floor than your head.++ There is a 50mm "high grade magnet" helps achieve a large bandwidth reproduction.++ It comes with a gray velour-like pouch that you can store your headphones in while not in use. This storage pouch will keep you headphones clean and dust free when not in use.++ It comes with a 1/8" (3.5mm) and 1/4" (6.3mm) plugs for added versatility.SPECIFICATIONS:Type..............................................................

This is a set of headphones that will last a lifetime, provided you take good care of them. I can find nothing negative to say about the SE-A 1000s at all, save perhaps they don't fold flat, but they aren't the type of headphone you'd expect to do that. I think if you decide to purchase these headphones, you'll quickly learn to appreciate their fine qualities, qualities not often found in headphones offered at this price. These are a mid-level priced set of headphones that can equally match the quality of the higher end headphones.
$review_summary.: This is an excellent set of headphones for the money ...

$REVIEW.: I write very few reviews but feel this one is warranted and deserved. I purchased the Sony bt2700 previously and had terrible results with both the audio streaming via bluetooth as well as the microphone clarity since some genius engineered the built in mic behind the face plate. I was a bit apprehensive about purchasing this JVC model as it is not carried by Best Buy and the salesman told me they may not carry any JVC head units soon because the audio quality didn't measure up to the competition.I could not be more happy with this unit!1. Installation was an absolute breeze. I purchased the Scosche FD1423B Pocket Installation Kit for 1999-Up Select Ford, and the Stereo Wire Harness Ford Expedition 98 99 00 01 02 (mine is 00' expedition), and the installation was so simple. Red to red, green to green, etc.2. Color variation is amazing with this unit. You can truly match any illumination setup in your vehicle so the unit looks like it just belongs there.3. Blue tooth connection. The phone connection works flawlessly. The only hitch I have run into is the phone book transfer does not work on my HTC droid as of yet, but that will be fixed with the update to android 2.1 in late Jan. The external mic is placed in my gauge inset of the dash to hide it from outside noise yet be in line with my voice. The clarity is great and mic levels are adjustable. The audio playback via bluetooth is also great. Some minor freezes during song changes or if my phone is receiving emails and texts at the same time but that is the phone choking not the head unit. I love my music but am not and audiophile by any stretch of the word, but the sound quality of the music through my stock speaker system seems great for a unit that others comment on the "lack of excellence". The only con I can really hit on the bluetooth is that it takes about 5-10 seconds to fully connect to my phone before audio playback is ready each time I start the car. Feels kinda slow but compared to the shortcomings of the Sony Bt2700 easily workable.4. USB inputs. The USB connections are great as well. My wife has an Ipod touch which I connect to the usb extension cable which I ran under the dash and comes out just fwd of the center console. It scans, reads, and controls the Ipod touch from the head unit perfectly and is charging the Ipod while connected. The sound from it is amazing also as it it using the digital audio out on the Ipod vs the analog headphone jack. It of course can also connect to the Ipod touch via bluetooth but we prefer the usb connection for this. The front usb jack is where we plug in the bluetooth dongle (which I am convinced is why the bluetooth works so much better than built in bluetooth systems).All in all I am very happy to write this review and have this unit.

$review_text.: This is our first upgrade from a standard, inexpensive, compact point and shoot. Maybe it is just me but I am blown away! I think the average person will find this camera to be fantastic. Photography nuts will undoubtedly find issues with controls and sensors and things, but for the rest of us that just want to take a good picture, it fits the bill.Size: This thing is a little smaller than I was expecting, and that is great. It is easy to take pictures with one hand if need be, but is also comfortable to hold in two hands.Pictures: To my eye, the pictures out of this thing are great, and much improved over our older cameras and current cell phones. For now I have just been using the Auto settings and letting the camera decide what internal things to change, and it is great. I am a notoriously bad photographer (at least according to my wife) and even she things I take good pictures with this camera.Usability: I haven't played with the picture taking settings yet (ISO, aperture, etc). But I have played with some of the pre-set configurations and they work as advertised. It is easy to adjust so I think I will sit down one day and really get a feel for what I can change. Taking movies on this thing is ridiculously easy. Push the little red button by your right thumb and you are in movie mode. Sound comes in pretty well and the movies look great on our TV. The optical zoom is excellent and the &#34;finder&#34; feature when zoomed way in is indispensable.WiFi: So setting up the wifi was amazingly easy for me. The instruction book jumps around a bit but if you follow the instructions, it takes less than 5 minutes. I have successfully connected the camera to my home Wifi and computer, as well as my tablet and phone. I love that I can connect it to my phone/tablet even without an available wifi (the camera itself becomes the hotspot). This is perfect for downloading vacation pictures in the evening.Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase. For the price, I feel that I am getting a great camera with a ton of features. For those that want more than a traditional point and shoot rectangle camera, but don't want to drop a grand on a DSLR setup, this camera is perfect. Even my photog friends are impressed with the capabilities of this little guy.

$REVIEW.: This has no bass.  Zilch, nada.  It's only as expensive as it is because of the Bluetooth and built-in rechargeable battery. But it does have that, is VERY portable, has good clarity and surprising volume, all of which makes it perfect for the workshop or for tunes while working, in which case it beats lugging around a heavy boom box where high-fidelity doesn't matter.  From high to low volume is 20 steps, going from whisper quiet to garage filling sound.  It might actually be hard to find something at a lower price that can play louder, and for some this would be perfect.

$REVIEW.: I can't say enough about this huge umbrella. The light is fantastic. Every year I photograph all the families at our church for mother's day. I normally use two small shoot through umbrellas and a reflector. The problem I have is I only have seconds or if I'm lucky a minute to get the whole family in position and shoot. With the differing height of the various family members and no time to adjust lights, I'd have a horrible time with shadows. Not anymore. I used one of my Alien Bees 800ws light on 1/2 power 10 feet back from the subject(s) and the light was perfect no matter if it was a couple or a family of seven. I can honestly say that this is the best purchase I ever made to add to my photographic arsenal.

$REVIEW.: I had previously written a bad review for this radio, citing weak antenna performance. My bad. I took the radio out walking with me and it works fine, and it picks up a lot of AM and FM stations. I guess the reception inside my house is bad for some reason, but out in the open this radio performs very well. Sound is a bit tinny, but that's to be expected for such a small radio and at such a low price. I'm glad I bought it. It does what I wanted it to do: allow me to pick up NPR and the local classical music station when I'm doing my daily walk.  As a bonus, I can also pick up the CBS AM station (740, KCBS) in San Francisco, which is a great source of Bay Area traffic and weather information, updated every 10 minutes.

$REVIEW.: For those who don't already know, this is an excellent integrated amp. I first read about it in Stereophile magazine. Now I can't give it five stars, of course, because I'm an audiophile and every piece of audio equipment can be improved. The sound is much better than you will get from just about any receiver - clear uncluttered sound that's essentially free of any stridency (some say it sounds "tube-like" which I would liken to what you often hear from an amplifier with MOSFET output devices.) Due to its high output impedance it does not like to be paired with speakers with absurdly low impedance (like, ahem, Infinity 8 Kappa) with which the bass is unfocused. The amplifier is well built, quite heavy and has a somewhat understated elegance about its front panel (I have the black version.)Yes, I don't like the fact that it has no balance control (which is probably why it sounds so good) and cannot be brought out of "standby" mode without the remote control. Yes, if the remote fails (or is misplaced) while the amplifier is in standby mode it cannot be turned back on. Period. Not even by unplugging the amplifier from the mains and then plugging it back in. In such a situation your main recourse is to find another functioning remote control! Hmmm.Maybe I should give it four-and-half stars. Highly recommended.

Just plug it in and have your computer search for wireless available, choose the Belkin, and poke in the provided password on the preprinted card included.

If you want to change the password, you'll have to install the CD software of course, but I see no reason to.Update 01-11-13.  My router is upstairs, and constantly requires unplugging and rebooting to connect to even a Kindle e-reader.  Downstairs on my laptop, I get a slow connection.

I had no available 3.5&#34; HDD spots and needed to add a SSD for the OS.  This unit allows you to utilize the 5.25&#34; bays of a tower to install 2 SSD's.  Of course you still need to have 2 SATA connections available as well.I've seen complaints about the brightness of the front LED's but as the tower I have this in isn't in my line of sight I can't comment on it.

$REVIEW.: I'm sure this could be a wonderful little device if you place it CLOSE ENOUGH TO YOUR ROUTER! I'm sending it back in exchange for the XR model.  I spent a couple hours trying to download the software on this thing, and after repeated crashes eventually gave up and called Roku Tech Support.  After a 20 MINUTE WAIT I finally found someone in India to "guide me through" the installation process.  My router is in my home office with my computers... duh!... and I wanted to use this product in my bedroom on the other end of the house, where my Wii system downloads Netflix movies PERFECTLY!  After making me run back and forth from bedroom to office, and after making me unplug my cable modem, both my office PC's, my router, etc. (you know the drill), she FINALLY told me this:  "You must move your router closer to the Roku unit."  I explained that these two rooms were at opposite ends of the house, and she said, "Then you must move the Roku unit closer to your router."  Oh, like in the KITCHEN MAYBE???  Or maybe on a coffee table in the LIVING ROOM?  I finally gave up and said I was going to return the unit in exchange for the XR model.  WHAT a HASSLE!!!  And nowhere can I find where Amazon or Roku list the "range limitation" on this HD unit.  I guess we're just supposed to buy one, try it, go through tech torture for an afternoon, and THEN discover the range on this thing is pretty minimal.  Sure hope the XR model works better than this one in my configuration.  If not I'll be returning that one, too.  VERY frustrating afternoon!!!  Spend the extra $25 and get the XR model to begin with.  It may save you the hassles I went through today....

$REVIEW.: I'm used to 14" laptop monitors and dislike the huge ones which seem to have come into vogue. They're harder for me to concentrate on, visually annoying, and clunky, in my opinion, especially the widescreen ones. Unless they're far away, they actually give me headaches watching film clips in full-screen.This monitor is none of those things. It is the perfect size for residing a couple feet away from my face. The pixels are clear and bright and colorful. It is comfortably full-screen.I hadn't expected the monitor to tilt downward slightly, which was a little awkward having been used to a laptop screen-- but it was something I got used to, and it's fine now.The settings are all pretty self-explanatory. The monitor was perfect plug-and-play. It even shuts itself off to save electricity when I get distracted with something else, and more importantly, it lets me tweak the settings for that shut off.Not a single dead pixel. It's bright, and clear, and comfortably small, just perfect for my workspace, and perfect for me.

$review_text.: So I built a new system and decided that I wanted a rotated board. I figured I'd get the aluminum Fortress series but unfortunately they don't support quad GPU (only 7 expansion slots).That left the Raven. I'm not disappointed with it, but I wouldn't say it's fantastic. I'm coming from the gargantuan HAF-X so it's quite a bit different. For one, since it's got a decent bit of plastic, it's quite a bit lighter. It's also more compact and not as tall (yet you can still fit everything you would need to). The trade-off is that it's not all metal. Also, the side panels seem a little flimsy/thin. I don't mind that too much since once it's situated it won't be moving.Pros:- Light- Rotated board- 8x accessible expansion slots- &#34;Normal&#34; build time- Easier access to rear IO ports (since they're on top)- Magnetic dust filters on the bottomCons:- Plastic- Flimsy in some areas

$REVIEW.: The sound quality of this headset is fantastic. It can switch between a simulated surround sound and a standard stereo sound with the click of a button. The software that comes with the headset is really easy to setup and use. When gaming it is easy to tell the directions of sounds. The headset is very comfortable and can be adjusted. I've worn it for hours and you start to not even feel it there at all. There are buttons for controlling the sound and toggling the surround sound, and a switch to mute the mic located on the bottom of the headset.My only complaint is that the microphone has to be on the left side of your head, and due to working in fast food, I've gotten really used to a microphone being located on my right ear.Overall this head set is fantastic, and there are no real complaints.

$review_text.: I am very pleased with the design and functionality of the unit. Drobo customer service was very helpful and even followed up with me after my inquiry was made. If you are interested in the this product, be sure you understand what you are purchasing. You are buying an empty external 5 bay HD box with a fancy controller in it. You will need to supply your own SATA type only drives to place in it. Also note that you will get &#34;LESS&#34; than half of your total drive capacity. I purchased a 3TB drive and installed it along with two 1TB drives for a total of 4TB. Actual usable storage is only 1.78TB. Plan on &#34;big&#34; drives to have large storage. The only other point I will make is that although all of your data is safely redundantly backed up with this device, you could still have a controller failure in the box making all of the data useless. I have high hopes this won't happen.

$REVIEW.: I purchased two Wireless Access Points to hook up to my GB Ethernet network to enable Wireless access for laptops and PDAs

 Each of these came with one of these wall plates
 I like it because it helps keep my desk clean and gets the wires out of the way
 For that alone it is worth purchasing

 While who needs 10 of these, I'm sure you could sell the extras on eBay for a profit.It is a bit confusing to hook up until you realize you must remove the rubber feet


I used a pair of small flat head pliers inserted into the center hole to twist them out.I recommend taping into place in a few trial areas before choosing a permanent place for it


 I discovered that when I found a "Sweet Spot" my ground floor Access Point covered the whole house
 I will probably remove the upstairs Access Point and give it to my brother for his laptop use.

$review_text.: Suction cup is strong & hold itself well to glass & window, but that's it. If you plan to use the suction cup on your dash, it will not work, as many dashboard surfaces are textured or molded without any smooth surface.The clamp opens wide enough to put the Galaxy Note-2 in very easily. I have silicone case on mine & despite the thickness, I have no issue to open the clamp wide to put the phone in.In many states it is illegal to mount any device to your windshield. I have mine mounted to my driver side windows & with some adjustment of the base & suction cup position, it provides a good viewing angle, though limiting opening the window. The suction cup has been holding itself well for the past 8 days & has not fallen off. The clip is adequate & hold my notes-2 in place.The negatives are:- It rattles & wobbles a little bit.- It is hard to put the phone & take it off. It requires two hands & since it is on my driver side window, it requires some twisting of upper body to have access to clip handles with my right hand too.- The plastic material could have been made stronger. But again for under $10 it is acceptable functioning device.Unless you are willing to pay more than $17.00, this may works depending on your car type & available place to mount it.

$review_text.: I have used these both to power PoE Access points and other devices.PoE is the best way to get an Access Point/Router into an area without power. You either need an Access Point that accepts PoE or you can use a splitter such as the TRENDnet TPE-114GS. If your AP accepts PoE all you need is to run the ethernet cable. If you want to use an AP without PoE get a PoE splitter, it will remove the power from the ethernet cable before entering the AP and give you a DC connector to supply the AP.You want to make sure you are able to give enough power to the AP. The TRENDnet puts out 15.4W which is enough to power something like a WR54GL (with a splitter). Though you do want to pay attention to line loses. You can calculate how much power is lost in a run with an online calculator ([...]).

$REVIEW.: ***Update****I've had the Tv for 2 months now and I have the same opinion - a great unit. Of course, after only having plain cable, I just had to go out and upgrade to HD Cable.  What a difference and well worth it.I did have some issues where some stations would break up or not come in.  It turns out the cable connection was off of a splitter on a marginal line (quality-wise).  Once I disconnected the spliter (disabled another room) all came in great.  A stronger signal is required for digital/hd tv. Of course, none of this was the tvs problem.This is one rather large online purchase that I have no regrets about.  Amazon was Amazing.  The price dropped a total 4 times in a 30 day period after purchase and each time they credited my account.  What a great company.-----------original review starts here------------I researched HD TVs for a long time going between LCD and Plasma; 42" vs 46"; all brands, etc.  It wasn't long before I was able to narrow the selections down to only a handful of brands and models.  In my opinion, the Samsung LNT-4665F 1080P won hands down based on both expert and customer reviews; price; and past experience with Amazon.I've not been disappointed.  I purchased the set and received it 3 days ago.  Hopefully, I'm not speaking too soon as I've not had it long enough to see if any idiosyncrysies develop, but so far, it's performed to all my expectations. The picture is great and the glare I was worried about is minimal if not non-existent. I've even downloaded the latest software release from AVSFORUM and updated the TV to the lastest release.The delivery was "white glove".  They carried it to our upstairs bedroom, unpacked it and set it where I asked.  They powered it up and attempted to connect the cable and DVD.  I say attempted as they used the wrong connection port for the cable input but that's ok, they're delivery men, not audio visual experts.  A simple switch of the cables and all was working. They asked if I wanted to keep the box and packing materials or if I wanted them to take it away. They took it away. Both fellows were very polite and professional.Between the time I bought it and before delivery, I noticed that Amazon had reduced the price another $30.00.  I sent an email and they promptly credited my credit card account. So far, my shopping experience with Amazon after purchasing numerous items has been super.I would caution you though.  Don't start checking the price of this tv months after you've purchased it - you'll be disappointed as the prices are droppping rapidly.  My son purchased a Samsung 46" model (720P) earlier this year for about $2200 and it's now down to $1400.00. However, I'm sure had he purchased from Amazon, he would have realized a $300 to $500.00 savings over a chain store.

$REVIEW.: The camera is great, I intend to carry around it around with me when I am not using my A77 setup. It has a lot of the same  features as the A77. The lens is a good size and speed for the type of shooting I like to do.I wanted something that was more than a point and shoot, so I could play with exposer times and depth of field. So far so good. I like the size of the camera with the MegaGear Ever Ready case made for the Rx100M II, it made it feel better in my large hands, and not so slippery when I am working the controls. Plus it fits in my shoulder bag, case and all without taking up too much space. The extras you get with this kit is just saves me time and money looking for all the bits and pieces.Overall I think this little camera will fit the bill when I am on the run. Can't wait to give it a real run down.

$REVIEW.: If you need a second camera to capture another angle of the same scene, this should suffice.  But as a primary camera, it's a little too unreliable.  Not that it breaks, but the video quality is just too unpredictable.As many have mentioned, the auto-focus issue is a big problem.  Not only is it slow, it happens even when it shouldn't.  I could have the camera on a tripod pointing it to a pot of plants for 15 minutes and the image would randomly come in and out of focus.A few have mentioned to simply turn auto-focus lock on.  But auto-focus lock does NOT work!  Initially it appears to work but after a short time, focus begins to drift.  When I tried pointing my camera to the aforementioned pot of plants and let it record for an hour with the auto-focus lock on, after about 20 minutes the video became inexplicably blurry.  The same thing happened when focus was set to manual.  Others have seen this phenomenon, not just me.  Just search "FH1 blurry over time" on the internet.Finally, this camera creates gaps in your video if it spans over 4GB long (or about 20 minutes of HD video at max settings).  Others have talked about this as well.  The gaps can be as long as 6-10 seconds.  I'm not sure how people can brush this off as insignificant but this is a major flaw.  Imagine you have your camera set on a tripod recording your son's baseball game or your daughter's school play.  Wouldn't you like to have the comfort knowing that the homerun your son hit wasn't skipped or your daughter's monologue was safely recorded in its entirety?One thing I learned from this experience is that many factors must be considered in order to determine the performance of a video camera.  I used to think it was just the size of the CMOS sensor.  And this camera has a very large one at 1/2.5".  It seemed the pricing of these cameras just confirmed my thinking.  The larger the sensor, the higher the price, and thus the better the camera.  So for such a large sensor at such a low price, I thought, "How could I lose?"  Boy, was I wrong.  Sure it does have a large sensor, allowing it to handle low light situations well, but its focusing problems seriously hurt the video quality, making me wonder, "What good is the ability to handle low light situations when its problem with focusing will ruin the footage anyway?"Anyway, shortcomings aside, when conditions are right, this camera does take amazingly high quality videos and does very well in low light as expected.  It picks up things I have trouble seeing with the naked eye.  Plus the camera is small and light and comes with lots of cables.  It even comes with a remote.  I'd recommend buying it, especially now when it's 280 bucks (I paid 50 bucks more).  For the price of many digital still cameras, you get a very capable HD 1080P video camera.  Just be aware of it's quirks.

UGH. i don't understand why the tv will not pass dolby audio to the optical out.

That's because it has a low power processor and Asus has a good cooling system.Cons:-Web cam is low quality because of low megapixels but I rarely use it-I don't think the RAM memory is expandable but I'm still researching thisI would buy this computer again.

$REVIEW.: Being on a budget & not being able to afford the pricier Canon Speedlites, I ordered this unit back in July 2012 as my first flash unit. For the money, it works well after taking the time to learn the settings. The unit worked well up until last week when the focus assist light/LED stopped working. I shoot a lot of indoor/outdoor dance music events & depended a lot on the FA light to help the lens auto-focus in low light/no light situations. I contacted YongNuo via their website to get info for warranty repair/replacement since it's still under the 1 year warranty and their reply was the following: "This is Ryan from YongnuoStore.com. Thank you for purchasing Yongnuo Products. I suggest that you contact your direct sellers. We can help you to repair your product, but We do not offer international shipping for the product which don't buy from YongnuoStore.com. The international freight is very expensive." (US Postal Service $16.95 6-10 business days/$74.95 3-5 business days). Basically since I didn't buy the unit directly from Yougnuo, Yougnuo's rep is saying they will not pay for shipping to China for warranty repair.I've contacted Amazon & the reseller, LinkExpress, regarding warranty repair/replacement. Amazon responded by offering a one time 20% refund because it's been over 30 days to return. I'm still waiting for a response from LinkExpress. Hopefully I can find someone locally to repair it, if not guess I'll have to go purchase a Canon 430EX speedlite & keep this one as a slave.

$review_text.: I chose the Garmin instead of TomTom because it allows latitude & longitude entry for destinations, which works fine. The unit itself is a joy to use, but I don't use it except for vacations. The unit came with lifetime map updates, which I just tried to use today. The process just didn't work well for me. I tried 'Option 1' (Garmin Lifetime Updater), and everything worked fine for downloading the program to run on my computer, then running the program, which did connect with the Garmin plugged into the usb port. It then says to 'add a device', and I clicked 'ok', but nothing but the progress bar for 5 minutes. The tech support guy said it should have been instantaneous. While waiting the 20 minutes to speak with tech support, I tried 'Option 2', (Download the Garmin Map Update application to guide you through this single update without installing permanent files on the computer you are using.). This actually worked, and I was able to start the download process. However, it takes a long time (45 minutes) to download, then it estimates another 39 minutes to prepare and install the maps. It would be so much nicer if the map file could be downloaded at work, which has a fast T3 Internet connection, then run the install as a separate step. The tech support guy said the Lifetime Updater would run continuously on the host computer, looking for updates. This isn't something I would want, but it wasn't disclosed, just that this was 'Option 1'. The tech guy pointed out an option on the Garmin account where I can get an email notice when a new map is available. This seems like a much better way to do things. At the very least, how these two options operate should be described better.

$REVIEW.: I'll just add my issues to what I have not seen posted about this tablet.1. Speakers are weak and can be distorting.  Similar to ipod touch 4th generation speakers.  HP TouchPad speakers sound noticeably better.2. Hard time picking up a weak wifi signal.  Nexus 7 tablet has to be closer to the wifi source than my iPod Touch and HP TouchPad.3. Warm skin tones (more orange) from the Gallery viewer compared to same picture on my laptop.4. In my opinion:a. it is still slightly heavy for its size - it feels like I'm holding a battery in one hand (I know, that's because I am).b. the display of images and text are average; my HP TouchPad is brighter, whiter, sharper text (and not because it has a bigger screen).c. the tablet does not feel as durable as the Samsung 7" tablets, but is much lighter.I have two commonly reported problems: occasional brief screen flickering and one dead pixel (seen as a white dot on a white or light grey background and only visible at a wide tilted viewing angle - so, can't see it from normal viewing angles).After using it for over a month now, I'll keep it and use it because of its small convenient size and weight compared to a 10" tablet and counting on quick availability of official major Android updates.

I had some older CD books/wallets but was looking for an option that provided something a bit more secure and larger and the size of the 240 case is perfect to fit on the bookshelf without being too large
Purchased 2 of these and filled them to the rim - very well made and they are so far just what I needed
As an FYI you can fit album cover in the front pocket along with a CD and then another CD in the back pocket, this option works great for 2-disk sets

$REVIEW.: Works great
 I was worried about parallax but the circles were well focused at infinity
Easy set up.You can actually look through the beam splitter at the circles as well as the reflection of a (bright) object making it easier to use when you are looking at objects high in the sky.I use it on my 8" Meade.Cons:Minor - Something other than two sided tape for popular telescopes would be nice.Great value.No complaints


$SUMMARY.: Much better than a finder telescope - for bright objects

$REVIEW.: This planter-speaker is larger than I thought it would be, even given Amazon's listed dimensions


It is certainly 14&#34; tall, but the 14&#34; length and width is the diameter of the opening of the unit
I know 14&#34; doesn't sound very large but, yeah, it's pretty big

Although the unit tries very hard to have a nice terra cotta coloring, in execution it's more orangey than I'd like and tends to stand out when placed amongst terra cotta pottery

I took to rubbing some dirt on the exterior surfaces to give it a more roughened look, which helped conceal it
One thing I did notice right away was the build quality; there were no signs of casting flash, for example, and the buttons had a solid positive feel to them.Although the unit is 14&#34; tall, about half of that is taken up by the speaker


You'll only get about 8&#34; depth when planting


And YES, the audio quality DEFINITELY changes depending on what's inside the pot


An empty pot will give you a deep, echoing bass which actually sounds quite nice in an enclosed room
Fill the pot with damp soil (and a plant) and suddenly more midtones and treble than there was before


I do not recommend filling this with something decorative, like stones, as they will rattle around from the sound waves and distort your music.External controls are basic and uncomplicated


The power button is inexplicably on the underside of the unit, requiring a deep squat/hands and knees approach whenever you want to turn it off or on
Fortunately the planter-speaker is on raised feet and even though I have large hands I had no problem reaching underneath to hit the power button


Still, I find this a dumb location


Who wants to put their hand under a planter that's been sitting outside for who-knows how long? I'm sure more than one customer will find themselves grabbing at bugs and spiders while looking for the power button


Note that although the manufacturer calls this unit &#34;water resistant&#34;, they also recommend not leaving the unit outdoors during rain or snow.Near the base but on the side of the unit are are buttons for volume up, volume down, and Bluetooth connectivity, plus jacks for power/charging and audio (AUX) input/output
Again, this will require a deep squat/hands and knees approach to use the buttons
Furthermore, all buttons are hard plastic and similarly shaped, making tactile location impossible unless you happen to remember exactly where all of the buttons are

I would have preferred for the power and volume buttons, at least, to be located closer to the top of the unit

There is no remote control.Audio can be delivered to the unit wirelessly via Bluetooth, and pairing is simple


Hold the Bluetooth button on the unit for a few seconds (until the LED flashes), then locate and pair the device from any device that can send Bluetooth audio
I successfully paired this with several iPads, iPhones, a MacBook Pro, and (just to see if it worked) a Garmin GPS.The AUX jack does double-duty

You can plug any audio device into it via a standard 3.5mm audio jack, so it'll work with things like old-school iPods and such that don't have Bluetooth
You can also connect additional planter-speakers to extend your audio field, though when you do this your audio source must be Bluetooth

In either case, there's a bit of a song and dance you have to perform (holding down a volume button for a few seconds) to tell the planter that you're using the AUX jack for input (from an MP3 player, tape player, etc) or output (for chaining multiple planter-speakers)


Kind of annoying butnot a deal breaker.Power is provided by a sealed rechargeable battery that's good for at least six hours


The manufacturer says &#34;all day&#34; but I wasn't willing to test that claim

I comfortably got six hours out of it and the unit still had juice

You can also power it directly from the AC adapter which will charge and power the unit at the same time.So, how does it sound? Very good, actually
I was prepared for a woefully tinny sound but was pleasantly surprised, especially after I filled it with potting soil and dropped a begonia mix inside
Inside my house (where I have a number of wireless devices including Wifi routers and telephone system) I was able to get about 45' away from the planter-speaker with my iPhone 5 before I lost the connection, but that was also through four walls including one with plumbing
Outdoors, I got about 60' away with a clear line of sight before the connection dropped
So, connection distance is very nice.Overall I think this is a very well done unit


The only things I would change are the placement of the buttons, and I would drop the price by about $20 or so

Still, for about a hundred dollars as of this writing it's a great hidden speaker to have for outdoor entertaining.



$Helpful?.: [10, 11] $SUMMARY.: Great sound and good build quality, but clumsy control placement and a bit on the pricey side.

$review_text.: Some Pros:+ Nylon velcro closing pouch to hold cables and nice fabric corsair pouch for other items+ Modular. good quality cables+ Sheathed main power cables+ Quality build you can feelSome Cons:- ?? None so far. will update if any cons arise.Installed this wonderful power supply from Corsair today. It was fun to open and see all the extra pouches and stuff you get. Installation was a breeze. My system only used four of the modular connections so i still have many available for an upgrade. Changed to this PS from a Hiper Type M 880.. I suppose that was a quiet power supply too, because i was expecting this one to be a smidge more quiet, unfortunately it didnt work out that way. The ASUS P5Q has a power utility with some presets and on 'Turbo' or 'High' the PS is audible, on power saving modes it is very quiet as was the Hiper i replaced. I suspect maybe one of my case fans may be on the way out. The Hiper was not modular, so that was an upgrade. Overall I'm happy with the quality and price. Powered up and running the system great so far. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great power supply.System:Lian Li PC-65BASUS P5QIntel E72004gb g.skillSapphire 6850X-Fi xtremegamer

$REVIEW.: Update 4/15/2014I purchased several more of these that were on sale for real cheap (under $50 each) - all were Revision A1 and firmware version 1.03
I upgraded the firmware to the latest on each one, which as of 4/15/2014 is 1.10


All of them work well if connected via the Ethernet connection


Wireless worked great for me so long as I used WEP wireless security, which is what my DLINK router was configured to use


Since I have a number of 802.11n devices now, I decided to change my network from using WEP to WPA since WPA fully exploits 802.11n speed

However, making this change has caused me a lot of grief with the cameras that using wireless
After reconfiguring them to use WPA to match the router, none of the cameras worked & caused the DLINK router to crash

Rather than changing my router back to WEP, I decided instead to disable the wireless feature on the cameras and hook them up to wired Ethernet

This was not a problem for me given where I am placing the cameras near LAN outlets


I have read posts from others complaining about the wireless functionality having issues with this model camera


I am suspecting that maybe it would work fine for WEP but not for WPA.For the cost, I am still happy with the camera as it meets my needs


If I want wireless, I probably will go with a more current model.Original Review:I have a number of these cameras


I have a few around the house to keep an eye on things


They do an ok job
Resolution is about what you'd expect for an IP camera at this price


I have some connected via wired Ethernet, others are wireless


They work ok even at night having my porch light on, so I really don't need the night vision that the nighttime camera provides


Works good with MyLink app
I haven't tried it with the D-View app

I also plan to try it with ManyCam software, but haven't had the time yet

I am also using a couple to keep an eye on a remote location using the MyDlink interface


In that case, the camera is wired to the router and I get decent performance viewing remotely across the internet using Internet Explorer as my browser.All in all, I'm satisfied with the camera for what it does and the price.Dlink Customer support, however, is horrible


I called once and the guy I was talking with seemed clueless on a simple matter I was having with the stand
I eventually figured it out myself, but their tech support was not helpful and seemed dismissive.I've used Dlink products such as Routers and earlier model IP cameras, and have been mostly satisfied.

$REVIEW.: I researched and tested portable DVD players for quite some time, wanted no less than a 9" screen and couldn't justify the expense of a quality laptop PC w/a DVD drive. It came down to the Panasonic DVDLS90 9" or the Phillips PET1000 10.2". I decided on & purchased the Phillips based on multiple online reviews and hands-on experience with both at the local electronics superstore. My comments:The Pros:1) EXCELLENT picture in all respects, best in the portable DVD world. Resolution/sharpness, response time, color accuracy, etc. is the best I've seen. The Panasonic had a TERRIBLE picture (non-progressive) that artifacted badly especially with animated material and was considerably less sharp and color accurate.2) Handy slimline remote that does everything except load the disc and order the pizza.3) All the cables you'll need (AV-RCA, Component vid, S-vid, Cig lightr cord, ac/dc cord). The Panasonic only came with AC & Cig lightr cords.4) Overall sexy & high-end looking slimline player 10.2"W x 1.2H x 7.1"D (w/batt: 10.2W x 2"H at back x 8.5"D) The Panasonic unit is only slightly smaller (9.3"W x 2.06"H x 7.31"D) and has a smaller screen.5) Plays multiple formats as listed in specs, but interestingly enough WILL also play a CDr filled with JPEG images despite reviews on other sites to the contrary (CNET.com). In fact, the unit has an image viewing menu that allows you to display thumbnails and view slide shows. The only drawback is that it will only display filenames up to 10 characters in the old Windows-style file reader, not a really big deal. NOTE: does not recognize avi, bmp, pcx, wav, wma, & wmv files.The Cons:1) DISSAPOINTING BATTERY: a) 3 flimsy plastic clips in a row that hold batt pack to player will take NO punishment before snapping off. b) When attached, batt sticks out 2" beyond back of player & 1" below. c) Batt life is rated 2.5hrs, I've averaged about 3hrs with brightness/volume set to mid levels. You'd expect a higher capacity batt with such a nice player. d) long recharge time.2) Personal Pet Peeve: when playing any recorded disc that has multiple viewing angles (ex: The Vandals - Live at the House of Blues), there is a small but distracting angle icon that appears at the upper rt side of the screen. After some frustration & a useless conversation with a useless Phillips CS rep somewhere in India? who advised me to return the unit for repair (wrong), I found the answer on Phillips website: the icon cannot be turned off when playing a multi-angle disc, so be warned.3) Some functions (slo-mo) are only accessible by remote so don't lose it. Also hard to read the remote buttons in average/poor light.4) No included carry case, no handle on the unit.5) You must press on the disc door near the "open" button in order to latch it, otherwise it won't stay shut.6) Somewhat noisy drive mechanism during startup & when accessing chapters, but only a slight hum when it counts like when watching a movie. A minor con.Other reviews have knocked the sound quality. I'm somewhat of an audiophile and have no problem with the quality from this unit. You won't either if your expectations are realistic about the sound that should come out of portable DVD players. Although the Phillips has some annoying design flaws mainly with the battery, it wins in my book because of the unequalled quality of its 10.2" picture, ease of use, cool remote & styling. An extra aftermarket or higher capacity Phillips (when available) batt pack should solve any playing time issues with you international travellers. Get a high-quality padded case and carry it around with the battery detached. I recommend this player for anyone that takes good care of their stuff, values an extremely high quality picture, decent sound and mutiple connectivity choices. This player is not for the kids in the back seat of the soccer mom SUV. Get them a 7" Mintek or Coby. You'll be less angry when they spill their Coke on it.
$SUMMARY.: Overall beautiful player with a few dissapointing flaws

It takes great snapshots, is easy to take with me wherever I go (it is very small, fit's in a shirt pocket), and it also takes great video.  My only complaint is sometimes action shots look a little blurry, but those are easily fixed, or I just take another picture.  The small size makes it a little difficult to take extended amounts of video, putting it on a tripod would be advised if you plan to take more than 5 minutes of video (which isn't what I got it for.)

$REVIEW.: PROS:Big casePlenty of fan mountsExtremely easy to manage wiresUSB 3.0 ports on the front panelCONS:Only comes with two exhaust fans, which is pretty cheap for a premium-priced caseMy top 200mm fan was producing noise from the motor, attempting to replace it (just the fan) with Antec now. (Update: I ended up just mounting some acrylic over the top vent - made no difference in cooling performance.)The rear exhaust fan performs average at best. I replaced mine with a Cooljag Everflow fan.No instruction manual comes with this product. Again, pretty cheap for a ~100 dollar case. (Google search "Antec Eleven Hundred Manual" to find it on Antec's site)This case is big, beautiful, easy to manage wires with, and has space for a whole lot of fans. That said, the two that comes with the case are too few and too under-powered. Filling the two front intakes at least is a must, and if you are an overclocker then be prepared to spend at least 60 dollars more on intake, side intake, and replacement exhaust fans. Despite its couple shortcomings, I would still recommend this case as it is easy to work with and great to look at.

$REVIEW.: I might look elsewhere for my next purchase, but I think it's more like I just had bad experiences.Let me just make a note here, I do have decent headphones. I'm using the HD598 from Sennheister.First off, I had some severe issues with mounting this card. I cannot mount it to my tower and have it in any port at the same time. It's simply not meant for my case, or something (note, my HD7950 GPU mounts perfectly fine, no troubles with it). Either way, I've got this thing hanging out by the port, literally. It's actually sitting up okay, but I'm expecting issues to arise rather soon. I spent a few hours trying to see about fixing this, but it's clear that it's just not going to happen with me. I got fed up with trying to properly mount it down, despite the fact that it's actually sitting rather stable right now.The drivers have a bad reputation, so I steered clear of them. Immediately downloaded the Unified Xonar drivers from MaxTech.So far, no complaints on that. It's a little sad that entire drivers from external sources are better, though. Oh well.The audio quality .. honestly .. I have only tried music on this so far. I'm not recognizing much of a difference (maybe a little bit, but not substantial to what I can tell, and I do have a fair pair of headphones), though I can say I'm able to apparently raise my volume an boatload more and blare my ears out at 100% with shockingly stable quality (no static, and it's literally three times as loud as my onboard sound, which is actually kind of nice for my speaker system.I'm probably not going to keep it in the end, though.

It may be my IPod and I haven't given up yet, but I haven't had any success either.  I'm going to try it in another car and also go to the website of the manufacturer to trouble shoot.  I looked there once already and it said something about resetting which I haven't tried.  It wasn't that expensive, which is a plus, but this is the 2nd product I have tried.  It makes me less impressed with the whole idea of using my IPod in my car - it ought to be easier than this (IMHO).

$review_text.: This package, almost exactly the same set, cost 40$ at Radioshack by my house. I bought it from Amazon and couldn't be happier. The build quality of some parts, mainly the 12 volt adapter, seems cheap, but nothing has broken yet and I've had it for over 3 months (use it everyday). Definitely worth the price.

$REVIEW.: If you really want to increase the speed of your system, to include boot times, and enhance performance of programs you need an SSD. I run my OS from this card and my computer boots in an average of about 5-7 seconds from the time I power it on...the thing is lightning fast and it runs extreamly smooth! No hicups glitches or any other problems whatsoever. I love the performance boost this card gives my system. If you want to enhance the performance of any system I highly recoomend this card!

$review_text.: I bought this for my tablet (Ainol Novo 7A) which features mini HDMI out and the ability to play really high bitrate content, and 3D bluray rips.  I liked this cable because of the small profile at the mini HDMI end and I figured the thin cable would provide less strain on the tablet's port.Cutting to the chase - I'd get flicker on certain scenes during movie playback.  Always the same scenes, at the exact same time - so it wasn't a fit issue.  But the scenes played perfectly when I switched back to my old adapter and cable.  Also - I found I wasn't able to play big (20 gig+) 3D rips, when the other cable could.So . . . for most tablets and cameras this cable will work fine.  I suspect this cable will be fine for the Tegra 2 tablets (Original Transformer, Galaxy Tab, Acer Iconia, etc.) since playback is generally limited to 720P.  But if you play high quality video - it could be a problem - I don't know what the actual limitation is.
$SUMMARY.: Good - But Won't Play High Bitrate Content, Most 3D

$REVIEW.: You probably checked our Roku when you are pondering on this one. I tried both. I don't see any clear advantage of either one on streaming from popular media providers like Netflix or Hulu. But you can see a very different design philosophy when you play with both devices. WD TV supports much more video formats than Roku and the menu makes it much easier to navigate through a huge collection of video/movies on your attached external hard drive, DLNA server, or even network shares. Roku's support is more for a small set of files. WD TV is good for a huge library. On the other hand, Roku constantly adds channels to their list. It is designed more for online streaming. If playing back your media collection is an important part of decision making, I will strongly suggest you pick this one.
$SUMMARY.: Superior support in playing back local media compared to Roku

$REVIEW.: I was attracted to buy this Blu-Ray player because of the affordable price and the features it offers. Even though the internet conectivity is not ready because it lacks the Wi-Fi adaptor, it is good value for the money. It loads movies very fast and the 3D movies look great and flawlessly.The only way you can connect this blu-ray player is through HDMI interface, no component video output available, so check for and HDMI input in your TV before you buy this player.I actually kept it for a long while, over 14 months before I finally set it up because I didn't have a TV with the HDMI cable input and I was not in a hurry to use it. And when I finally installed it a few months ago, it was impressive, noiseless and smooth!I've played it now, in all maybe about 5months and I'm happy for this choice. I really recomend it for the great value!

 Really thick and not too flexible


 This is an issue because it actually bends the connector on the drive

$review_text.: If what you want to do is stream stereo a2dp to your car, and you have a mini jack and USB power outlet (for example from a cig lighter adapter), this is a great solution.  Yes, you will have to hit the blue/brown button on the unit each time you start up the car, to resync.  But it works 100% of the time, and sounds good.But be aware:  My phone (iphone 4) was great for hands free speaker phone use if I used a cable to connect the headphone jack to the car stereo and relied on the iphone mic for speaking --- but it DOES NOT work with this bluetooth device.  The audio is never routed to the bluetooth device.  Color me sad on that.So I am still looking for an all in one solution!

$REVIEW.: I had a Samsung LCD that was about 2 years old and wanted to upgrade to a LED type LCD. I did some research and was leaning towards another Samsung but then Sears put this Sony on Sale and that changed my mind. I didn't think I could afford this type of TV before the sale price. I went ahead and purchased the Sony. ( I almost switched to the Samsung when I went to pick it up) Once I got the TV hooked up and seen the picture quality, I thought I made a big mistake. I started playing with the picture adjustments (there are a bunch by the way) and could not get the picture anywhere close to the quality of my old Samsung. I was getting ready to box it up and take it back when I decided to look up some recommended picture settings online. I found lots of different opinions on what others did to help the picture quality but they didn't work for me. I then remembered reading previously online about a problem someone was having with there new TV and they ended up turning off the light sensor that adjusts the picture darkness to the room lighting. I went ahead and turned off the light sensor and WOW, what a difference. The picture now had the "POP" that I was looking for. I like a brighter picture and even in a brightly lit room, the sensor kept the screen too dark. Now if I watch this Sony for a while and then go look at my Samsung (Hooked up in mancave), there is no comparison. The Sony wins hands down. I have looked at a few short 3D clips that are available online and they are not bad. I have not messed with any of those settings yet but I am sure I will.Pros: Gorilla glass, bright clear picture, does a good job with reflections, quality of buildCons: Picture degrades very slightly when viewed from an angle, I have to go through the wireless set up again if I don't use it for a while(switching to cable), stand is not sturdy (has a spring in it that allows the TV to wobble easily if touched)

$REVIEW.: This case is fantastic, especially for the price.  It fits great, looks great, and keeps the Touch 5G very low profile like Apple intended it to be.  The little rubber surround that goes around the face of the device is the only slight flaw I've found as the bottom of it above the lightning connector is a bit flimsy.  They should have put a little support strip between the top and bottom piece in that area, but overall it doesn't really affect the look or functionality of the device so it doesn't lose any stars.  Just something I would change if I have to nit pick.Anyway, to summarize, awesome case, awesome value, pick one up.

$REVIEW.: Well, I just received this case for my Dewalt heat gun with LED.  Since it didn't come with a case, I wanted to protect my hand tool from breaking.It is hard for me to recommend this case when I found so many things wrong with it.1.  The key lock doesn't work at all.  I put the key and twisted left and right, but it doesn't lock.2.  My unit was rusted at the chrome plated handle.  I had to get a clean paper towel to wipe it off, but I can't clean between the handle section.3.  The two open/close mechanism feels very flimsy and loose.  If I drop it, then I bet it'll pop open.4.  While the case is close, I can easily press against the opening/closing edges inward.Overall, I'm disappointed in the unit even though the price is cheap.  I bought another case about the same size from Bolton Tools and that case has a better build quality.  It's a little bit more expensive than this case, but I rather spend the extra money.  I just don't feel safe carrying this case around in fear that the clamp might not hold it secure in place.I'm surprised to see people giving this a high rating.

After doing much research I found that one of the other Sony models was rated the best in terms of input lag however, they were selling it in the awkward 47&#34; size.  This TV was next on my list and I have absolutely no regrets.3D:I don't believe that 3D is the future.  I still believe this is a gimmick to boost prices on blu-rays and going to the movies and I don't see any value in having 3D.  That said, I neglected the fact that this was a 3D TV.  Once I opened the box I was surprised to see the glasses in the box.  They were stashed away for the first 2 weeks I had the TV, then I decided to check it out.  WOW, it's actually pretty darn good.  I'm impressed with the depth and the comfort of the 4 glasses it comes withGaming:This is a great TV for any gamer.  The PS4 and Xbox 360 I currently have hooked up to it look remarkable.  These consoles were hooked up to a Samsung I purchased earlier this year and looked great, but hooked into this TV they looked phenomenal.  Sony uses some great smoothing technology that really makes the graphics and text pop.If you are looking for a new TV that can be used for gaming, I HIGHLY recommend this TV.  One of the best ones I've owned.  I have always had Samsung in the past and this was my first Sony.  I wouldn't be surprised if I purchase a Sony television from this point on.

$review_text.: I adore the Powermat and case on my iPhone 3, so I was looking forward to using this case (and battery) for my iPhone 5


Unfortunately, while this case is certainly slimmer and sexier than the older clunky version (as is the iPhone itself), that nicer design comes with an unacceptable cost.The problem is with the charging port extension on the end of the case:- the extension extends the case about half an inch past the end of the phone- the sides of the extension aren't solid, rather they are two flimsy plastic wings on either side of the copper-colored socket (Duracell branded, I get it)- those wings also cover the earbud socket, with a tiny hole for the jack


If you want to use anything but the original Apple buds (which have an unusually slim jack base), you need to take off the flimsy plastic wings
Then you need to find someplace to put them while you use your earbuds.- the ends of the wings snap to the case using a simple plastic pressure fit

As a result of taking the wings off and on several times a day, this snap is already worn out (after less than a month)The plastic of the case is also relatively brittle, and has collected several chips (yes, the phone got dropped

But still.).Much of the case's fragility can be mitigated by leaving the battery attached to the case all the time, but this means you have a large clunky phone instead of a slim and sexy one, and you still can't use non-Apple earbuds without taking the case apart
(And part of the value of the "kit" was the ability to charge the battery on a Powermat base all by itself, without the phone attached).As I noted above, I'm quite happy with my iPhone 3 case, despite the big silver square on the back and the somewhat dated profile


 I hope the next generation of Powermat charging cases will take a step backwards, to the good old days


I can't recommend this device.Update: The flimsy plastic wings have now gone from "worn out" to "snapped in half"


 Two months...

$review_text.: I purchased my A620 in July 2006 prior to a cruise to Alaska.  I also purchased both 1 GB and 2 GB SanDisk memory cards and 2 sets of Sony rechargable batteries plus the Sony charger.Before the cruise I took about 600 photos on the original charge of one set of the batteries.  The manuals say the batteries should be fully discharged before recharging them, so I then made 6 1GB videos trying to empty them.  Then I read in the back of the manual that if you primarily use the optical viewfinder and make only occasional use of the screen the camera may take as many as 1500 shots on one set of batteries.So I took the camera to Alaska with the original set of batteries on the original charge.  On photo # 1453 the camera beeped twice and put a message on the screen "change batteries" !  I put the other set in and kept shooting.My friends on the cruise were amazed.  Most of them had to recharge their digital camera batteries every night on the ship and several of them ran out of battery during the day anyway.  Some of the smaller digital cameras were only getting 150 shots on one charge.All the other good things about this camera are true, too!  Big prints, no lag, good screen, good flash, Digic II is a winner!
$SUMMARY.: Excellent battery life too!

$REVIEW.: In the truest sense, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I have always bought ArmorSuit for all my portable electronics with no issues, but I thought I would save a few bucks and try Tech Armor out. I went through the entire screen cleaning process, including using the sticky lint remover, but neither of the two screen protectors included would go on without bubbles appearing under them due to a tiny piece of dust. And unlike the ArmorSuit application, there is absolutely no way to force the bubbles out. I tried like hell on the first one before I abandoned all hope and ripped it off to try the second one. I somehow managed to get the bubbles to appear only on the edge of my iPad, so I have just left it on. I did, however, end up buying an ArmorSuit screen protector to replace this P.O.S. I suggest you just learn from my mistake and save yourself the hassle - spend the extra four bucks on a better product.

$review_text.: I'm a mac user, through and through. I didn't realize that by buying music from itunes and using ipods that they were compatible with each other... ONLY WITH EACH OTHER. My ipod got lost so i wanted a new mp3 player but was tired of getting ipods. I decided to look around and found that this mp3 player was the competition for the ipods. I decided to try it.... not realizing that it was for PC's (but still compatible with macs, as i found out later)!! I got it home and almost returned it until I found out a way to make it work for me. I converted all my songs to mp3's (all the songs I bought off of itunes were in m4a versions, incompatible with mp3's) which took FOREVER.. i also had to remove the protection on my already bought itunes music so i could USE that which I BOUGHT.I have been working on this all evening but it's WORTH IT for this cute lil mp3 player. I've already filled it up with music and am about to buy an 8Gb card so i can put MORE music!What I love MOSt about this mp3 player is the FM player. i love listening to the radio and there are times that I just want to hear a song w/o having to purchase it (unless I really like it). This gives me the option to listen to even MORE songs without spending money. LOVE IT.a techy friend of mine (techy = technically savvy) told me there was some external adapter FM player for the ipods too... eh-- i'd rather have this mp3 player! SO CUTE, So good looking, Works amazing, love it through and through!If you have PC, it's compatible and you won't have issues (unless you've bought itunes music too.. Then you have work ahead of you). but if you already have itunes music and you like ipods, why go to all the work. unless you want the FM PLAYER!! (love it)

$review_text.: I really loved this mouse until it stopped working yesterday
The failure seemed spontaneous, but it could be related to repeated extensions of the cord
It suddenly stopped working with my Chromebook with no jerks or power surges or other obvious cause

My Windows laptop now reports a usb error when I plug it in


I'd give the mouse five enthusiastic stars if it had lasted longer, but other reviewers report a shorter life span, so Verbatim should investigate
Still, I had it for over a year and was very happy with it, so I ordered a replacement today
For ten bucks, I'm not complaining loudly.The mouse is very attractive, precise and responsive
It's small, but I bought it for mobility and had no trouble adapting to the size

I even preferred it after a while

I considered Verbatim's wireless mini mouse, but the extendable wire works well, and I prefer not to worry about the battery.

$review_text.: I initially wrote the review below, which I am leaving for reference
 I am revising upward a couple of stars because after contacting Griffin, they agreed to replace the cord for free


 I think 3 stars is about the max for this item though as a result of iffy quality for the money, and the replacement procedure at Griffin turned out to be a little too cumbersome (show photo of destroyed item in front of a computer monitor with the representative's email in the background)

 Should I send a photo of the item destroyed with today's newspaper as well?  I guess they have to protect against fraud somehow, but that seemed like a lot of tapdancing to replace a prematurely failed iPhone cable.---------------I am so frustrated with cheap cables


 How hard is it, especially if you're paying $16 or so, to make a cable that will hold up more than a few months?  I was not "rough" in any way with this item, and now it will not charge my iPhone whatsoever.I'll definitely be writing Griffin about my unhappiness


 I might expect this from a $2 Chinese cable or something but this is much too expensive to fail this fast.

$REVIEW.: This was purchased to add to my new netbook - Asus eee PC 1000HE. I too had problems installing the software. I still don't know if I have the current firmware version or not as the directions were confusing. One of the first install steps was to check the firmware version. There are directions to download a program that queries Windows & reports what hardware is attached.It was unclear if the resulting report lists the installed firmware for the detected device OR if it is advising the current version that needs to be updated. After way too much time on trying to decipher the sometimes strange use of English & missing steps in the instructions I gave up. I'm just hoping that Amazon had the most current hardware.Note that there are numerous files added to the start up directory. For a full blown laptop/desktop these may not be a performance issued but for a netbook with it's limited memory & processor power it can significantly slow boot up & performance.The Nero Essentials software also did not install. No autorun of the install disc occurred so I had to browse the CD & choose every 'setup.exe' file. After several failed attempts running the various setup.exe files in the Nero directory the 'setupx.exe (note the X at the end)worked on the 3rd or 4th time through. There were error messages about system timeouts. I still don't know why it eventually installed but it now shows up in the program files directory.I still haven't tried to burn anything yet....... Hope it goes better than the install.

$REVIEW.: My original router/modem was one of those 2wire things from AT&T.; It recently fell apart (as the 2wires from AT&T; seem to do a lot), so I bought a 3rd party modem, thinking it would be better. For the first 3 months, it was great. Easy to set up and connection was good. Then a week ago it started to go bad. Internet would go down at least once a day. By internet go down, I mean the router stops transmitting, both wifi and physical connection. Nothing could find my router unless I rebooted the router. It fails about once a day, sometimes twice. I thought the 2wire was bad...but at least it lasted 3 years. This thing lasted 3 months!**UpdateTheir warranty replacement process was relatively painless. Just call, tell them what happened, and they send a new one out and have you ship the old one to them. No pre-paid return shipping, tho.

$REVIEW.: Quality build materials (what's visible anyway) with a very nice crossover. Their sound is much nicer than the 20 year old paper &#34;whizzer cone&#34; Realistic speakers they replaced, but I feel like the low end is slightly lacking somehow (probably just much less distorted).  Very pleased though, they've got a low profile once installed and being able to aim the tweeter helped noticeably with stereo imaging. The room is a little more 'filled' with sound instead of sounding just OK when you're on the couch directly underneath them.  I didn't know what the inside of the ceiling looked like but it turned out I had tons of room... I should have gotten the 8&#34;,  but I'll just keep that in mind as I eventually replace the others in the house.I wouldn't use them in a home theater setup, but they're perfectly adequate and priced right for having music on when company is over.

$review_text.: If you hear or read about Bose'e Room filling Sound, they are talking about a room that is no larger than 12'x12'.  I have the Cinemate in a 20X30 and you can barely hear it at the back of the room unless you turn it up so loud that you can't be in the fromt of the room. I wanted a 3D sound without a bunch of wires and speakers crowding the room and wires everywhere to trip over. Bose told me that they don't make a 2.1 system for a larger room. The closest they get is a Lifestyle System tht is three times the cost of the Cinemate GS ii. Also there is no volume indicator on the Bose Cinemate , so you must guess at the setting or learn to count the number of off and on times the power light blinks( this is the volume change indicator. The Subwoofer at least has a volume control on it so you can get the ballance between base and voice to your liking. As far as the 3D effects, I can't hear them. ( they are supposed to be better in the Lifestyle models, but I wasn't going to lay down more money on a 2.1 systen than I paid for the top of the line LG 3D TV.So unless you are willing to have speakers all around your room, you need to get used to the base rich sterio sound of the Cinemate. I have tried three different brands (one of them was Sony's new 550)  so far and none give as good of room filling sound with just the front speakers and a sub woofer as my old TV which was a Sony KD series 60" lcd rear projection with  high quality built in speakers way out to the side of the screen.If you are going to spend the money for the Cinemate GS ii, you might as well try the Yamaha 5100 sound bar system with an external Subwoofer. In any event, do like I did and work with a retailer thet guarantees sadisfaction or a money back or exchange policy.The 3D sound from just the front speakers and a sub  is a lot harder to get than the retailers lead you to believe, at least this is what I am going through with a larger room with a Cathederal Celing.

$REVIEW.: I was ready to steer clear of Logitech keyboards after my disaster with the Di Novo Media Desktop Laser. I have way too much clutter from chords on and around my desk, and I was looking for a way to diminish the wires. The battery issue was not attractive to me, as I was used to wired keyboards and not having to worry about buying batteries for anything. But the benefits of the risks outweighed the costs, so I decided to give wireless keyboards one more chance.My first foray into the wireless keyboard world was the HP Wireless Keyboard and Mouse. It was okay...some of the buttons did not work well, and then there was the mouse (**sigh of disgust**). In the end, for a user of advanced wireless keyboards, I was sorely disappointed by the lack of definitive features. It was okay as an introductory wireless keyboard, but nothing amazing.Then I tried the Di Novo. I am happy that I was able to get my Computer working after that one. It was RIDICULOUSLY expensive, and I was unable to get it to work. I returned it in a day. I was sorely disappointed. I LOVED the look of it, and I wanted the wrist rest, as well as the laptop-style of the keyboard and the keys. Laptop keys have usually been easier for me to use than traditional PC keyboards, and I wanted a Keyboard/Mouse combo that was stylish, comfortable, full-featured, and economical.I saw this keyboard combo at my local electronic store, and I got to experience the feel of the keys, as well as handle the mouse, the receiver, and make my decision as to whether or not this set was worth the money. I decided that I was worth the try, and I got it at a great price.The set up was not that hard--the only issue for me was that the SetPoint software took awhile to install. That could be because of my Anti-Virus software, but it did work. The prompts were straightforward, and after I restarted, the only thing that I found a little different was that I had to connect the devices. With the HP keyboard, I did not have to connect them manually, but they just worked. I had to manually connect the keyboard and the mouse to the receiver for the Logitech combo, but it was easy, and so I didn't mind.You have the option to open the Quick Tour upon restart, and it showed you very well how to set up the features. The customizability of the keyboard is nice. It has just the right amount of features for great usage without being overwhelming. I think that one of the best features has to be the ability to secure the keyboard so that the frequency resists interference from other devices, and so that the keystrokes can't be detected. It is very easy...it prompts you, so you don't have to be concerned with any complex instructions.The Keyboard and Mouse look really clean. The layout is different--the "Insert" key has been moved away from the Home, End, Delete, and Page Up/Page Down keys, and the Delete key is now large. I don't mind the Insert key being moved, because I hated accidentally hitting it sometimes and sending the keystrokes into "Overwrite" mode. But to some, this will be rather annoying (although on its newer styles, Microsoft seems to be following suit). The keys are somewhat closer together, which will annoy users with larger hands. The tactile feedback is similar to that of a laptop, which means less pressure to push, but lower bounce to the keys. I don't mind it, but to some users will be annoyed; it is just personal preference. The keys can be a little noisy as well.The keys are labeled like they are on a Microsoft keyboard--they have indicators that show what will happen when you hold down control + any marked key. That way, you never have to guess about commonly used shortcuts. And when you press the special function keys, the screen displays the action that the key perfoms on the screen, so you don't accidentally push a key and have no clue what you did.The look of the keyboard is really sharp. One thing that I do not like about it are the "legs," if you can really call them that. I don't think they are sturdy at all, and they do not add a lot of height. I don't even know why they are really there, to tell the truth. I wouldn't even bother with them...they may break to easily. The wrist wrest is not really useful. I can deal with it, but it really doesn't improve the ergonomics of the keyboard at all. The mouse is very responsive, and the SetPoint software gives a good deal of options to improve and fine tune the precision. The feel of the mouse is much better than the HP I used to have, but it is very awkward. If you use it too much, it just gets hard to hold on to. The wheel button on the mouse is pretty hard to push, and if you use browsers with mouse gestures, the SetPoint functions may override the handling that is in the browser. The battery latch is a little surprising to get off because it comes straight up, but I have not major quibbles with that. A neat feature is the invisible optic tracker, that does the job without the red light. The 4-way scrolling worked better on this mouse than it did on the Microsoft mouse.The receiver is a little flimsy to me. I would have liked it sturdier. Overall, this keyboard and mouse really was an improvement. It is not perfect, and for the price, I would recommend it.

$review_text.: This product arrived promptly and was in original factory wrappings

It works great and is even less expensive than you can get at your local retail markets

I have used it for a couple of months now and it is identical except for the color to the controller which came with the PS3
It is motion sensitive with force feed back
If I ever need another one I would buy again.

$REVIEW.: I am currently using two of these (Purple models) mounted in my Corsair Carbide Series 500R White Case... They are mounted on the side, to bring air in and blow on the graphics card and motherboard. The case came factory with a Clear 200mm Corsair fan with White LEDs mounted in this spot (the 500R case offers many different mounting options for fans, including 120mm, 140mm and on the side, 200mm), and I have to say I MUCH prefer the dual 140's over the single 200. Of course they are a little louder, but for the sheer amount of air that they pull in and blow onto the card and motherboard, it's worth it, and of course you can always slow them down a bit.The build quality is nice, made with quality materials. Blades spin nice, free, and smoothly, and are very quite with Corsair's blade design. There are no rubber mounts on this fan, but honestly, it doesn't need it from what I can see so far. They spin smooth and don't rattle or vibrate your case (though on this case, the side panel fan mounts all have rubber grommets). Of course if you wanted to, you could always get some size 6 or size 8 o-rings and simply mount them between the case and the fan body, if you ever felt the need to.If you're looking for some nice 140mm case fans. These are a good bet. They are built nice, quiet, move a lot of air, and look good doing it. What else could you want from a case fan?Side Note: I really wish that Corsair made an SP-Series (High Static Pressure) fan in the 140mm size. As the more I read up on fans, the more I'm starting to lean toward those being a very nice all around fan. They are able to push air through and pull air from tight areas. And if you think about it. In most cases, your fan is mounted against a mesh panel, and as in my case, not only does the fan have to pull air through the metal mesh, but also a fan filter, which is even smaller mesh. So maybe high static pressure fans would be a nice very versatile fan...

So this mouse just performed as I expected: tracked well, felt good in the hand and looked good too. I think I actually had this one already with one of my Windows laptop. They look identical. Both even have the same color.Like many others, I am curious as why Logitech marketed this mouse as Android's? It worked with every device that support Bluetooth! OK, I have not tried and don't think it works with iOS devices :-). So if you are buying this mouse, you can use it with both your Windows laptop and Android tablets.

$REVIEW.: This mount is for cement or block walls. I mounted mine to the foundation in my cellar. The directions stink big time. It seems pretty sturdy. I did not use the screws and inserts that came witr the mount. I went to my local hardware store and bought the very heavy duty anchor bolts. The anchor screws and inserts are medium duty at best. Again the directions are unusually poor and you have to figure it out by yourself. Anybody that has some mechanical ability should be able to do it.Update after 6 months. The TV mount has held up well. I have a 47" LG TV and it fits just fine.

$REVIEW.: The material, fit and finish is very nice. It looks and feel like a much more expensive case.The down side is that it is actually quite heavy, although it is quite thin.  I have another similar case I bought from ebay that seems to be much lighter. I think it must be the leather like material, and the padding of the front cover that makes this thing relatively heavy.It functions very well as a stand though. The different slots hold the unit quite securely at different viewing angles.

$REVIEW.: I found this 12 port USB with power to be exactly what I wanted


After searching through all the different types and prices I purchased this one because it has its own 110 volt power supply, you can use either side and shut off the other

I also daisy changed it from a 7 port USB on my desk, so I could have a handy USB for my key board , mouse, camera and a few other peripherals


I am very satisfied with my choice

The blue lite tops it off.

Also, these headphones worked out of the box- awesome treble and bass - reminded me of my Bose speakers

$review_text.: Ok I'm comparing this to the other case I have, the i-Blason Armadillo (ASIN B00F0R83VG), which I bought on Amazon for $12.99 + free shipping.First off, on both cases, all the holes for speakers & buttons line up perfectly. Don't worry about that.The OtterBox is definitely a great case, but this "mid-grade" Otterbox (Commuter series) seems extremely similar to the iBlason which is 1/4th the price.OtterBox comes with a screen protector which is nice (probably a $3 value), and the hole to access to stylus is a little better on the OtterBox.The iBlason has much more protection on the corners (bump guards), which makes me feel it has better drop protection, but it also makes it a bit more difficult to slide in & out of your pocket.The OtterBox also has a slightly sturdier backing to it. Also, I think the OtterBox tries to leave a small cushion of air between the case and the phone, for extra protection, kindof like bubble wrap.I think the OtterBox is slightly better quality overall than the iBlason, though the iBlason has the corner bump guards which are definitely more protection. I give them both 4.5 or 5 stars, but I'm marking the Otterbox down just due to price. The higher models are probably worth $40-$50, but the Commuter should really be closer to $20-$25.If you feel you need moderate protection for your phone (an occasional mishap or drop), I would probably recommend the ~much~ cheaper iBlason. Personally, I'm keeping the iBlason and giving the OtterBox to my wife.However, if you drop your phone daily, have an extreme work environment, or are really really rough on your phone, get the Defender series for about the same price. Or if you need waterproof, check out the Armor series.

It seems waterproof, it adds a little cushion without too much bulk, and its not obvious what I'm reading. I almost got the $99 leather case for its elegence, but opted for the practicality of this one. If youre looking for the absolute slimmest, look elsewhere, but for throwing it in a bag, this is the best choice. (I'm clumsy, and probably need the extra padding.)

$review_text.: I have been extremely satisfied with this player. If you are reading this review, BUY IT. It looks great, plays great, and has longer battery life than the IPod shuffle.A few minor gripes:a) Occasionally when I am uploading files from my computer to the Sandisk, it freezes up my computer. But it's okay if I just pull the player and then plug it back in.b) Selecting a particular song you want to listen to can be difficult because the scrolling through the list of songs is very slow, and after about 10 seconds the backlight turns off, making it hard to see what you're doing.But this is an excellent MP3 player. If all you want to do is play your mp3's randomly, or listen to a radio station then its perfect. It has an excellent feature that finds the 20 strongest radio stations and presets them for you in less than a minute, making it easy to listen to the radio in different locations that might get different signals from the stations.I actually have been happy with the pair of earphones that came with the player in terms of sound quality, but I may look into getting a cordless earphone, because the cord can get in the way while I work out. All in all, I am very happy I bought this player.

$review_text.: We bought this DVD player to be used with a new Samsung 19" TV in our small RV as well as on a screened porch.  We bought the campanion DVD in the same brand for campatibity.  The DVD is cheap.  The sound volume is poor even with HDMI cabling.  On several ocassions the play back has be poor, but by moving the unit and using another plug it has worked.  It seems to have some problems with self-recored DVDs -- skipping and screen going black for 1-2 seconds.  Most of the problems have been in the RV, except for the sound.  In the RV the sound is not a supreme issue as we are within 6 feet of the TV.  Samsung support gets a mixed review.  I called them 3 times about the volume issue.  Once I was told to reconnect it.  After several attempts I used a HMDI cable which did make some improvement.  The second call was transferred to the DVD "department"  because since the TV worked it had to be the DVD player.  Ultimately in the conversation I was disconnected.  The last call resulted in a suggestion to reset the DVD player. This did help a bit.  I would not recommend this player. It is also very slow to respond to the remote. So slow in fact you think you didn't do anything.Dec 24, 2009. I finally threw out the dvd players as it began to freeze during play.

$REVIEW.: I cannot get these to form a good seal in my ears and therefore they sound terrible, and fall out.I have had these for about two months and I cannot stop trying to figure out how they are supposed to fit, but no matter what I do, the cushions are way too small to hold the phones in place, and worse, they do not form the air-tight seal that they need in order to block outside sounds and produce good bass. Just hanging on the edge of my ear they sound tinny and thin and distant.I don't understand all of the positive reviews. I cannot figure out how people are keeping these in their ears. I have 5 other models of in-ear headphones, some of which are really cheap, off-brand models, and they all fit my ears and stay in place without any special effort at all. Not these! I have tried all of the ear cushions that they came with, and none come close to forming a tight fit. At one point I just pushed them so hard and deep that it hurt, and then they did actually produce very good sound. But that was neither practical nor safe. So I am left wondering; why are they so highly rated?I did read a couple of reviews that said the ear cushions that are provided are too small and that one must spend an extra $15 to get extra large ear cushions. But I am wary of spending another penny on something that seems oddly totally inadequate in the first place.UPDATE: November 11, 2013I bought some memory foam ear cushions for these to get a good seal every time. It didn't work. I am now able to get them to form a good seal and therefore produce really satisfying sound. But getting that seal is still a trick. Sometimes I can fiddle with them for 10 minutes and still get air and sound leakage in one ear or the other. These just don't fit my ears unless I flip them upside down. I don't get it. Why do my $16 Logitech UEs seal beautifully every time and these, at best, are always on the verge of falling out? I am not going to say that these were a complete bust, but maybe I am just trying to convince myself that I didn't just throw away $60 (with third-party ear pads)?

$REVIEW.: This is a great little flash to start out with, and to carry with you everywhere. It's superior to a built in flash- with an 18-105mm, I get shadows at wide angles with the D60's flash, and of course the built-in flash cannot be bounced.The SB-400 is tiny and light. It's much brighter than the built-in flash, and using it instead will greatly extend how long your camera battery lasts, though at the expense of using AAs in the flash. I have a pair of Energizer NiMH batteries in mine, and have shot at least 100 pictures using this flash, without changing batteries yet. It's small enough to fit into just about any camera bag and take everywhere with you, unlike larger speedlights like the SB-800. It's also about half the price of even the SB-600.It does have limitations. It doesn't pivot horizontally, so you can't bounce it off the ceiling when taking portraits. Also, it has no functionality with Nikon's wireless flash system- the only easy ways I can see to fire it remotely are the SB-28/29 cords, and the SU-4 controller, which will fire the flash you attach when it "sees" another flash firing. Being able to use this as a wireless slave flash would be nice, and would make this much more versatile.If you're just getting started in photography, not going to use the features of an SB-600/800/900, or just would like a speedlight you can carry in your pocket, this is great. If you're wanting to eventually use multiple or just remote flashes, and don't mind carrying a larger, heavier flash, I'd go with an SB-600 or SB-800.

I'm done with anything related to Logitech
Sure you get great sounds at the beginning, but the product life is under 1-year for all 3 sets I have so far

Mind you this is under daily commute usage


FAILED!******I purchased this product based on an electronic magazine's rave comparison and reviews against other high-end earbuds


The POOR cable construction is TRUE! 2-months into the thing used during my daily 2-hr commute with gentle care


The sound started to cutout from one side
Getting a replacement was quick and done within 2-weeks


Guess what? 6-months later, it's the same problem all over again!For $400, no one should have to deal with a weak cable line..


that said, superb sounds when it works

I can't recommend this to anyone unless Logitech comes out and offer recall..

otherwise, SAVED yourself the trouble and avoid this.Now I'm waiting to see if they will replace this 2nd broken set.

$review_text.: This is an old model remote from Vizio, the VR-1, (perhaps the first one they ever produced)
 Vizio has a relatively new universal remote that handles 3 components and is perfect!  Found it at WalMart for 9.95


 The model # is XRU110


If you have a Vizio TV and need a spare remote, get this new one at WalMart, (not the one I'm reviewing here).The VR-1 switches the positions for the channel up-down and the volume control, making it nearly usless
 All remotes I have used put the channel up-down on the right and the volume control on the left

 Not the VR-1
 Additionally, the buttons will give you the effect of multiple presses, even though you just want one
 I recommend you avoid this remote


 The one I bought is now available at the Salvation Army in Providence
 The new XRU110 is the way to go.Hopefully Amazon will carry this new (3 component Vizio) XRU110 remote very soon.

$review_text.: I've used this camera for a few years, mostly to take photos to post online. The resolution isn't all that great if you want to print out photos larger than 4 x 6. But it's a great little camera for point-and-shoot purposes. The only thing I regret is that it beeps when the camera focuses, making it inappropriate for use in settings in which noise would be disruptive, such as at concerts or in church. My son is embarrassed by me and my camera! Maybe there's a way to turn off the beep, but I'm just not that savvy. My other complaint is that it doesn't take good pictures in light situations where you're in low light and the subject well lit. I don't know whether there's a button I could tap to change that; I just can't "read" the setting icons. I've fiddled around to no avail. And, yes, recharging the battery is tricky. It doesn't fit well into the charger, so you have to set it in at an angle and look for the yellow light, which is so close in color to the green that you can think the battery is charging when it's not.

This is a thin plastic and won't protect against something catastrophic (like a long drop) -- for that you'll want an actual padded case, but this will protect against scratches and bumps and I highly recommend it if you want something in conjunction with the Apple Smart Cover.

I bought a pair of headphones with mp3 player that can download and play music. It can only be recharged by USB to computer that has software capability. It will prompt to download if not on computer, and if computer program too old headphones would not play.

$REVIEW.: I think the sound is great, and the noise cancelling works well


 The earbuds are quite comfortable, but, unfortunately, in-ear headphones start bothering me after some time by creating pressure points, some faster than others

 The comfort level will definitely depend on the user.I found the control box to be a little awkward at first because of its placement and weight, but, once I found a place to clip it to and after some getting used to, it did not bother me much.I think the price is too high for a set of headphones, and does not justify the benefit you are getting, but this is subjective.Overall, these headphones a) provide a great sound, b) have a good noise reduction, c) are comfortable; however, d) are pricey.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this TV based on picture quality and aesthetics, and figured that would justify the extra cost, compared to other brands with similar screen size. The colors and detail are vivid and striking! Sound is just average, but this is true with many thin screen TV's. I just attached external speakers to it for sound improvement. What is truly amazing about this TV (and i'm writing this as an update for November 2012) is that it actually worked most of the time during our 4 day blackout following Hurricane Sandy!!!  I don't know how, or why, but while our power was out, the only things that actually worked were some of our energy saving flourescent lights and this TV.  My guess is that current draw is so low on this TV, it will do this during some blackouts, where there still may be smaller amounts of energy available on the power grid.

$REVIEW.: Amazing quality for the price.It's extremely sturdy and is a great quality cover. It's thin, snaps on super snugly without coming up the sides (WHICH I HATE). I like how it ends exactly on the side keeping it flat as opposed to so many other cases. Also how the shell is hard and plastic, not like the soft vinyl or GHETTO leather of some other cases.Also, the DESIGNNN. As a girl, I practically squealed when I saw the choices, the flowers, the COLORS! and it looks exactly like the picture. love, love, LOVE! Honestly, it just looks so beautiful I might just get the other colors of the same design because I love it so much.It works well, with the sleep functioin etc. But I really just appreciate how it's slim and is smooth. I don't understand why so many cases have those weird bumps on the back; I suppose it's for better grip but how hard is it to hold your nexus anyways?? It's so small!The ONLY grip I have about this case are the &#34;stand&#34; settings. There's either like a REALLY low setting which is probably a 25 degree angle and a REALLY high setting (around 80 degrees?). I generally use the higher stand setting but sometimes I wish there was one in the middle which would be much more convenient and easier to implement.Apart from that, this case is great and worth every dollar.

My case arrived along with my kindle and I couldnt be happier! It's fun yet elegant, there is enough room for me to attach the skin I choose to my kindle without any issues, and while I hardly ever need to use the light, the few times I have, it has been more than sufficient.  No complaints whatsoever, I would feel comfortable recommending this case to anyone interested in it.

$REVIEW.: A decent mouse, especially for the price


 I would prefer a better, but I'm keeping this one just because the shape fits me well.Tracking is almost always good


 It's much better than Logitech's cheaper optical mouse on a dark surface

 It's not as good as the one Logitech made several years ago.Ergonomics is a highly personal choice

 The shape is traditional (which I like)
 The rubberized sides make for a more sure grip (nice)

 It's a little heavy (which I also like)
 The optical sensor is in the center of the mouse (which makes it more natural to control).The extraneous noise (button clicks and sliding) is what you'd expect from a low end mouse.The worst feature is the gliders; these are are plastic, apparently not any kind of non-stick coating

 It doesn't feel frictionless

 (This also contributes to the extraneous noise.)  I'm going to get some Telfon tape for it.

$review_text.: Some people complain about the head phones feeling cheap. They're actually sturdy. The sound is amazing. I haven't tried the mic feature as of yet. I've used the headphones watching anime, playing Team Fortress 2, watching Netflix and playing other games on Steam. They've sounded great.My only CON isn't unexpected. They're not noise cancelling meaning if someone is in the room with you and they're watching something you might hear their stuff unless you have sound coming through the headset. Also others will hear your gameplay or video if you turn it up too loud.OVERALL, I'm happy with the purchase and recommend it to anyone on a budget but looking for a great gaming headset.Sincerely,Lee.

$review_text.: This is a decent product. It does what it is suppose to do, however there is room for improvement.Installation could be improved upon. I am used to installing a product like the Zagg invsi-shield which has been refined many times over the years to make it better. This could use some more refining. The easy of installation is not really that easy to get a good looking install. I wouldn't use the tape because it really looks rigged. Use the clips instead. However I think a better look could be achieved with a refined tape method or stick to screen installation like the Zagg. I don't really care for the clips ability to keep it secured and in place.There are some trade-offs with the gold privacy finish. I don't like using it full time as it does dim the screen slightly. That where the clips come into play since it can be removed more easily than tape. So I would rather see:1) a more refined clip system that looks better, lasts longer and stays in place betteror2) a more permanent leave on all the time attachment method that adheres to the screen like a screen protector and still provides off angle privacy.Still this seems to be one of the best ones available for a MacBook Air.

$REVIEW.: I installed this replacement in my TV in early March and have not had any problems to date.  The picture is as bright as when the TV was new.  The is a bulb and housing assembly lest anyone think that is is just the bulb.  Installation was quick and simple -remove a few screws, pull out the old housing, slide in the new housing and replace the screws.  I purchased this because the OEM assembly direct from Mitsu was slow to be delivered. I had this one quickly via Prime.  When I purchased this item it was about 40% cheaper from Amazon vs. Mitsu.  I am concerned about the lifespan of a non-OEM bulb. The cost from Amazon seems to have increased significantly since my purchase. The life expectancy of a bulb is about 18 months based on what I've read.  If this one lasts a year I'll be happy for the price.  If it doesn't last that long then I'll update my rating.

$REVIEW.: This switch works great. Although I haven't been able to get the priority power up feature to work with my Directv DVR and a Samsung BluRay player. It always selects the BluRay player no matter if it is on or off. Turning on the Directv box should automatically select that input, but it's not. So I have to manually switch inputs with the included remote.Also, I tried using the Harmony 900 remote to switch the input, and it will work in IR mode but not RF mode. Which is what I needed, since the switch is in a closet.

$review_text.: If you're not an avid Garmin fan or regular user of this GPS, it may provide endless frustration as you have to relearn all the quirks and non-intuitive screens whenever you pull it out to take a hike.  Just as an example:  It has a great Trip Computer app screen on the desktop that allows up to 6 different functions (like speed, avg speed, stopped time, etc.).  But if you start out on a new hike, you can't clear or rezero this screen from inside the Trip Computer app.  Instead, you must remember -or stumble around until you find- that you must enter SETUP, then press RESET while hoping that it's not going to clear your current track, waypoints, or anything else that you don't want to erase, and then select RESET TRIP DATA.  It's not complex - it's just not intuitive, or easy to remember after several months of nonuse.  It's also not intuitive how to simply start logging a new hike, temporarily suspend, or end logging.  Yes, I know it's all "there" if you plow through the manual everytime, but frustrating even for someone who's very familiar with computers (and worse for anyone spoiled by Apple products).  In our latest use, we loaded the memory map card for Hawaii and headed out for the hike.  Couldn't find a way to search for the hike by name, but when we got close, zooming in on the map popped it up.  If there's a way to search for a hike by name, it's not in the manual index (and the manual doesn't have an appendix).  Again - just not intuitive or non-frequent user friendly.

$review_text.: I've been looking for a bluetooth mouse for some time. Nothing local worth owning, not in Microcenter, Best Buy, or Target. All the mice have those usb dongles and scream &#34;2.4Ghz!!!&#34; from the boxes, but I don't want to give up a USB port for a mouse or carry around a hub.So I turn to my favorite store in the world, and decide to take a chance on this mouse.The good -Handles well. It's compact, it tracks well on every surface I've tested it on, including my Intuous tablet surface. It's got selectable DPI that works. It feels well built, and is solid without feeling heavy. Easy to connect to my Macbook Pro. It's actually bluetooth, too.The not as good -There's nothing *bad* about this mouse. It is smaller than I expected, but not so small it's uncomfortable to use. The non-use power-down is a little faster than I'd like, but a quick tap on the mouse wakes it up quickly.Understanding that it's smaller than it looks, if you are looking for a real bluetooth mouse that works well, get it.

I sort of got it to work for a while, then one corner split apart.  I found another back cover on here that fits great and works very well (look at my other reviews if you wan to find it).

$review_text.: Good:- Very thin, so it doesn't completely change the feeling of typing on a Macbook- Fits the keyboard well. I experienced little to no shifting while typing- Durable: lasts a very long time- Clear color makes it hardly noticeableBad:- A little more expensive than I would like- Gets dirty / oily very quickly, and this makes the cover start to become more noticeable over the keys. If you keep this on and close your Macbook lid, the dirt will get onto your screenOverall, highly recommend this product. A better option might be KB Checkerboard cover, which has black coloring over the keys (transparent over the actual letters so you can still see them when you type) -- I imagine that when this one gets used/dirty, it will be less noticeable because of the coloring:KB Covers CB M CB Checkerboard Keyboard

$REVIEW.: We got this 200GB drive to help us with the additional task of backing up files between offices when we realized that our Seagate 160GB drive would not be enough to do both things: daily backups and data transfer between locations. Now this 200GB monster is sitting in one of the offices for our daily backups and the 160 GB (also a Seagate) is going back and forth and they are both holding up extremely well.The two only downsides to the 200GB drive:-It can be a bit noisy (I find it noticeably noisier than its 160GB counterpart), including the times when it's not in use.-It is not precisely compact in design. But having seeing how many overheating issues arise in limited spaces such as the insides of laptops, I am not sure having a roomy case is such a bad thing after all.All in all, I'd recommend this external drive for daily backups any day. I am sticking with Seagate!

I keep hearing that more and more people are being rude on their cell phones, and that limiting the battery capacity would limit the amount of time a person could be publicly rude with their cellular device. I keep hearing that rude occurances are on the rise, and that the government should arbitrarily restrict the amount of charge a battery can hold to reduce these things.  Well, the Department of Justice statistics have shown that since the introduction of the smartphone fewer and fewer people are being rude in public, and the media is blowing the few occurrences out of proportion. Don't let them take away your right to a high capacity battery, and buy these up just in case they try!

$REVIEW.: I had an older case logic binder which was great. When I needed more storage space I thought I'd purchase another case logic. The model I had before no longer existed so I went with this one. It's a good build and it works well. It's not too big as some reviewers suggest. The plastic sleeves that hold the CDs are cheap, even cheaper than the ones that came in my old case logic binder...but they seem to get the job done...and they're probably equivalent to other sleeves on the market. Would recommend and/or buy another if needed.

$review_text.: The RCA 7 inch HDTV is a good portable HDTV, but it's not perfect. Surprisingly the TV does not have a built in telescoping whip antenna but a short 6 inch antenna which attaches to the TV by it's 30 inch cable. Although a whip antenna wouldn't be great it would be vastly superior to the included antenna. Curiously this set up exists in other portable TV's too. All these 6 inch vertical TV antennas are a joke unless you and the antenna can actually see the television station's transmitting tower, that's all you should expect from these antennas. Face it, would you connect a 6 inch antenna to your home TV and expect reception? This micro antenna also has a very thin coaxial cable. Without getting into the science of it, thin coax loses whatever signal it's carrying very, very quickly even over short lengths like 30 inches. Bottom line the supplied antenna and it's cable is junk. The tuner in this RCA TV is just as good as most home TV tuner's, it just needs an adequate antenna to work well.The remote works fine but uses what I call bubble buttons. They all feel the same because they all have the same round bubble shape. This is different from most home TV remotes where one can feel the different round, square, or triangular shape of various buttons without needing to look and study which feature is which.Finally the Li-ion battery is built into the TV. I see no means to replace it if/when it eventually fails.Otherwise, the RCA works quite well and I like it. This RCA TV also has the standard coax connector antenna fitting that is used with real coax. Some portable TV's use a proprietary micro connector that is impossible to connect to real coax. This unit is nice to have on camping trips and the like but again be prepared to get a true functional small portable antenna preferably using real coax, for any of these portable TV's, these antennas do exist. Something like the Mohu Leaf or Terk antenna should work (I haven't tried them though). Don't buy the old school rabbit ears. They were designed for old analog TV's which operated mostly on VHF frequencies. Today's HDTV's mostly use UHF bands, the obsolete rabbit ears were never designed to work on the UHF band. I could explain the science but your eyes would glaze over after an hour.

$REVIEW.: I have had the palm 130 for three weeks and havae found it useful for keeping personal and business appointments, grocery shopping, and for a financial quick reference.  I was able to start using the basics after installation.  The Grafitti feature was suprisingly easy to learn; considering that it looked like something out of Gregg's Shorthand.  I was using it the first day.The games or books that can be downloaded or added are fun and helpful.  A solitaire game or hearts game can come in handy at the DMV or the dentist's office.  I plan on adding the Powergraph and Dictionary/Thesaurus for math and literature classes at a later date.The drawbacks are that the battery power drains noticeably after about 20 minutes of use.  This is a minor drawback considering that this is a color device.  I have also found when tapping near the corner of the screen, it sometimes won't "take" for lack of a better word.Although, I've never used or owned the PalmZire(?), I would recommend this 130 model.  The next reason:  it is expandable at least to 32MBS.  The last is that it's color.The Palm 130 is a useful, fun and easy to use device.  You don't have to be a computer wizard to get started.

$review_text.: In the past (PS2 devices), it was important for the KVM switch to send an electrical signal back to the computer to imply that a keyboard and mouse was present on the wire.  With USB, I guess this is not as necessary, because when I switch to another computer, I hear the computer I left acknowledge that a USB device is no longer connect and the current computer will also acknowledge that connection of a new device.  While this seems to work, it doesn't work instantaneously.  Sometimes I'm waiting a few seconds.  I find this very annoying.  Other than that, the device works and is well build.  It was a hard decision between 3 and 4 stars, but yes it is very annoying!

$REVIEW.: After my Comcast Internet rate went to its default price I purchased this cable modem based on the reviews of other buyers in an effort to save the $5 monthly rental charge.My package was delivered from Amazon.com in approximately one (1) week. After letting the package sit for a few days I finally decided I better install this modem and begin my savings. After reading the reviews, I was aware that I would need to contact ComCast in order to have the MAC Address changed in their system. My only problem before installation is the fact that it was 12 midnight when I decided to install my new cable modem. Therefore, I was wondering if I would be able to talk to anyone about changing the MAC Address.However, after connecting the new cable modem to the cable line, the computer, and then applying power; the installation (from ComCast) began. All while this is going on, I was on the automated voice prompt system and apparently a signal was being sent to re-cycle the modem (which was not ComCast issued). After a few moments I was instructed to open an Internet Explorer window at which point a ComCast Connection Initialization window appeared with two (2) choices; customer or technician. I then chose the technician button, pasted my account number, clicked continue and the modem was automatically installed about four (4) minutes later.I was so pleased with being able to install the cable modem by myself that I then decided to write this review. Additionally, I do notice pages loading about 60% - 65% faster with this modem; but at this point I am not going throug my router setup. Hopefully my increased speed will still be evident after reconnecting my router.Yes, it is still 60% - 65% faster than the ComCast Issued modem.

$review_text.: After a research on every single type of dslr case I've picked this one for it's zipper


Most dslr cases just close by the buckle but this case has the zipper to close the case completely along with a buckle
The straps are hooked on metal rings which makes the case very strong compared to the typical plastic rings


I carry a canon t3i and 2 other lens in it and it fits perfectly for my needs


If you plan on carrying more than 3 lens then you should definitely get the medium/large one


The straps are nice and cushioned and it definitely feels high quality


The extra buck is worth it for this case so you don't have to worry about buying a replacement for it

This will my recommendation for every dslr owner out there

$REVIEW.: I bought this computer from NewEgg for $350 to replace my 15.6" Dell Inspiron(Dell Inspiron 15 i15RV-10000BLK 15.6-Inch Laptop (Black Matte with Textured Finish)because I felt it would be better on my travels.As much as I love the Dell(bought it for $400 right here on Amazon), it is more suited for indoor use and short-distance travels(non-air). It it a little heavy - over 5 pounds - and in this day and age of computer phones and tablets, 15.6" laptops feel a bit too big and cumbersome.After buying this Asus, I think I will keep my Dell for the time being.The Asus is very light and svelte, feels and looks great with the brushed aluminum keyboard plate. However, after having a Samsung Intel i7 desktop, and the Dell i5 laptop, I can definitely notice this i3's limitations.This will be mainly used to surf the net, emails, business use, and light multimedia use, etc.I felt squished with the small screen real estate, so I used the HDMI out to my 50" TV, and when playing videos, there was a definite audio/video lag. This laptop is definitely not for gaming or processor/graphic intensive uses.It has a 11.6" screen, and after using the 15.6" Dell, to me, I think for laptops with 13-14" screens are the best sweet spot.The ultimate downer for this laptop is the quality of the screen: it is not bright, not made for outdoor use, SUPER reflective, and really poor viewing angles.For indoor use in a room with diffused lighting, it is ok. And it would be perfect for use on your hotel bed at night. But I can already tell, for use in a bright airplane, airport, on the road, etc., there will definitely be situations where it will really annoy you and negatively affect your productivity.So in a nutshell:PROS: Small, light, looks and feels more premium than its price; good touchscreen aspects; good price in relation to other comparable laptops(I got mine for $350).CONS: Poor screen - very reflective, dim, and poor viewing angles; 11.6" screen is a bit small for a productivity laptop; sluggish performance.So overall, although I love the way this computer looks and feels, the size and portability, I can only give it 3 stars on its best day. You get what you pay for. Do not buy this to use as your main laptop. For that, spend something in the $500-600 range.

Eventually I'll buy the topo memory card, but until then, I'm happy with the XOG as is. In use, the unit brings me to my destination every time. The only gripe I have concerns the battery life, which lasts 3-4 hours. It's no problem to just leave it plugged in to an accessory outlet, so it's a minor gripe. Also, the suction cup mount is very well made and sturdy. It has 2 pivot points which adjusts nicely.

$review_text.: I have a problem in my car with these audio cables.  I kept buying the 3 foot long cables, and from time to time, someone in my car would grab my iPod and pull it toward them to change a song, and they would pull far enough to reach the end of the cable and either yank it out of the jack or put strain on the end of the cable.  Over time, that caused fracturing of the wires inside the cable, and within 6 months or so, I would get nothing but static or one speaker would continually cut out.  Grr.  I bought this one in the 8 foot length so (hopefully) this wouldn't happen again.  So far, it's working perfectly.  Fingers crossed!

$REVIEW.: I own several HDTV's. All are plasmas, as this is the only current technology that gives you unlimited viewing angles and the best picture quality. When OLED becomes reasonable, this may change.I have a Samsung, a Pioneer Kuro and three Panasonics.This LG is the most reasonably priced big-screen (plus 50 inch) plasma you can buy.After tweaking the settings, the picture is good, but black levels are not on par with the Pioneer Kuro.I recommend this as a bedroom TV, not your main TV. (This is where I have it.)Sound from the speakers are good, however.

$REVIEW.: I bought this monitor a month ago from Amazon. I had been considering a Samsung, but preferred this one for the adjustable height. It is connected to an iMac with an Apple Mini DVI to DVI converter and a Cables Unlimited 6-Feet HDmi To Dvi-d Cable (PCM-2296-06). After a bit of fiddling to calibrate the colors (necessary with any monitor) I am very happy. There was no Mac software on the installation disk because it isn't needed. The iMac instantly and flawlessly recognized the additional monitor and I am able to adjust the height and angle to match the Apple display. It does not automatically rotate the image when the screen is pivoted (the one thing HP could fix with software), but I never use it in vertical format anyway.

$REVIEW.: I just received these ear buds and I am quite disappointed. I do not expect these to last very long at all. The sound is not the problem for me, it's just that it seems to be of poor quality materials. The cord itself is very, very thin so it's already apparent that the wiring is not very well protected. When I put the plug into my iPod if I even slightly twist the plug while it is in the jack I will get a lot of static. Not worth $20.

$REVIEW.: Most of the time anyway. This was my first HDTV, I purchased it a year and a half ago through Ubid for only 300 (including tax). For an HDTV even today is quite damn cheap. Sadly, I looked not only on Ubid and here but everywhere else as well and haven't seen such a good deal since...For a bargain HDTV the color saturation and clarity isn't too shabby. The viewing angles from my perspective are around 140 degrees. Settings are pretty standard, nothing special. The built-in scanner is quirky though, especially with comcast service. You can get a handful of HD channels but the channels under 720p get too hazy to watch.If you are planning on using it for your PC as well make sure:1) Your video card is HDTV compatable (HDMI slot) so that you can get the most out the signal quality and2) leave your settings for color set to factory default and set it through your video card. Don't worry about it effecting your TV or video watching experience, each input you switch to has its own profile, so you can set different settings for tv, console, ect.Some video cards have the spdif jumper you can attach to your motherboard so that sound goes though your HDMI cable as well but don't bother with it. I found the sound quality to be much better if you just do a direct optical connection from your PC to your home theater system.I love this TV; I have my pc, DVD home theater, and PS3 using it (and although PS3 claims to be full HD it is only 720 so this works fine). In a small apartment this HDTV is ideal, as well as any space-saver.I do have one major con to point out: I don't know if the recent commenters were just lucky or are working for the company but I have to agree with the tens of comments towards the back about all the issues you have (or will have) with this HDTV or any other HDTV Westinghouse makes. Since the name has been sold finally oversees (as someone already pointed out here) customer service and overall product quality has gone though the crapper. If it breaks, just scrap it for parts, you will save a lot of money in the process. After having mine for just an over 1.5 years I'm now just starting to get an occasional "pink distortion over white and dark blue over blue" as what many here have said before. It comes and goes once in a blue moon and when it does it doesn't last long so it doesn't bother me that much.In conclusion, any Westinghouse HDTV has a bargain price for a bargain quality. If you can get one of these for under $400 new then go for it, seriously. Major reason is that even though these are LCD tvs and not plasmas (why in the hell anyone wants to spend thousands of dollars for something that burns out as fast as a candle is beyond me) their lamps still have a short life span as compared to the "never goes away" CRTs. Over 80% of consumers who purchase electronics of any form end up upgrading around five years after it was purchase, so unless you are someone who has and likes to keep what you have around for many years then go out and get something nicer (but still do research on the item before you buy!). For everyone else this is perfect. Yeah, there is a chance you can get stuck with a real lemon that craps on you as soon as you open the box but the odds are safely low enough to take the risk. These should last long enough before you replace it with something better, and if not you didn't lose your life savings in it >.>

$REVIEW.: I didn't give it a fifth star because it ships with getjar for an app store

 While there is allot choices on getjar they are mostly older apps or something you have never heard of


 its an easy fix cause you can download the amazon app store easily and get the apps you want although angry birds star wars doesn't seem to work on this tablet.The plus side is its a great little tablet for games and for streaming netflix (app Required) it does everything I wanted a lower price tablet to do and more, as I just wanted something to give my samsung galaxy 2 a break from playing game after game after game every evening.This tablet gets used everyday for checking e mail, watching netflix, playing games, checking the weather, surfing the web, and once in a great while reading a book


 The battery life is very good I have watched a three hour movie without it needing a break for a charge and that was after playing games for about an hour.While this is not a kindle or a Ipad it is a great little tablet for small chores, its not designed to replace your computer
 It is very good at what it does and its made very well for the price.

$review_text.: I needed speakers to enhance watching movies on my laptop in bed, and to hook up to FM radio while falling asleep.  I could not be more pleased with these.I have had several 2.1 systems for various computers, from Logitech, Cyber Acoustics, etc.  The Logitech are great, but at least twice the price and the subwoofer is both large and heavy.  This set is just right, and the sound is impeccable.After a much less expensive set at bedside, these were a most pleasant surprise:  rich, full, clean sound; and supportive -- rather than thumpingly or boomingly intrusive -- bass.  A separate control module gives bass and treble control and on/off switch in front and back.  Haven't quite figure out why there are both.Other reviewers have mentioned the very bright LED on the control module, and they are right.  This one annoyance, only noticeable late at night, may be the only drawback to what may be, otherwise, the best set of speakers in its moderate price range.

$review_text.: I bought these after looking at several reviews
Most reviews are positive toward the sound quality


And I do agree with that, the sound quality is pretty decent.However, the comfort of these things is horrible
I kept thinking it was the tips that were bothering me and kept trying the different sizes


Also ordered comply tips
After much experimenting I was looking in the mirror at them (while in my ears) and realized it had nothing to do with the tips
It is the circular metal housing just behind the tip


Much too large

It presses against some of the other protruding parts of your ears
Within 5 minutes these things are becoming uncomfortable

Within a few songs I was ready to get these parasites out of my ears.Look elsewhere
Earbuds with driver housings that are narrow near where you insert them into your ears are a better choice.

 I wear them when I work at home and have had them on for hours without any problem


 The ear area is wide so that my ears aren't getting flattened by the foam and the foam is nice and soft on my head


 I tried the noise canceling feature but I really couldn't tell a difference with it on or off so I just took the battery out and have never turned it on since the initial testing

 This is the reason I am not giving these headphones 5 stars
 I think they are great even without the noise-canceling.

$review_text.: This is one of those products that really boils down to "Does it work?" and "Is the price right?"I'm glad to say that in both cases, the answer is yes
 This is particularly useful for connecting an MP3 player to an external speaker, and in particular, to cars that support MP3 input

 It's "long enough" but not too long for those purposes.Any caveats?  If you want to use it for anything other than those two purposes, such as connecting two devices that can't be easily placed next to each other, you'd probably be better off with a cord that doesn't coil, and is just a bit longer.

$REVIEW.: Most of Google's phones and tablets lack the ability to use external memory in the form of an SD flash memory card or even a USB flash memory. You can buy devices with 32 GB or more built in but there is a large price premium for that and you still can't swap it out. And if you bought a device with just 16 GB, you're stuck.A wireless NAS device like this is a nice solution to this memory problem. In my testing, the EasyAcc is fast enough to watch a stored movie.As an added bonus, you get a battery pack (nice for watching several movies on a long flight) and a WiFi router.I still think the manual could be a little better but it's good enough for my needs.

$review_text.: I primarily use the camera for backing my truck into parking spaces, and up to boat trailers. This camera replaced one I previously mounted to the trailer hitch, and lasted almost 10 years.  This camera fit right where I needed it, hanging upside down from the bracket, I get a right side up view.I still have 2 questions in my mind about the camera.  First, the longevity, and will it tend to rust.  The housing appears to be chrome, but I primed and painted the chrome with a rustoleum paint just in case.  I'd love to get another 10 years out of it, but at this price, even anything over 5 years would exceed expectations.

$REVIEW.: I was looking for good blue ray player/burner that I could use on my all in one PC


I had looked at and read many reviews from other popular brands but many had complained that they needed to use 2 of there USB to get there burners to work
I was trying to avoid that and I wanted something that I could just plug and play without having to worry about searching for drivers

I happened to run into this drive and it looked like it had everything I was looking for

I received it very quickly from Amazon and when I opened the box I was surprised how well the built felt


It feels very solid and sturdy


Even though my all in one PC has it's own built in blue ray player, it does not record blue rays which is why I wanted this drive

The other reason I wanted this drive was so I can copy a disc from one drive to the other, it takes less time and makes things a bit easier
I I have it plugged into a USB3.0 running Windows 8.1 and the drive works great


I would highly recommend this drive
If anything arises I will come back and post an update.

$review_text.: Used this mount with a 42 LG LED TV. I have no complaints about the quality or functionality of the mount. And the price is good. I mounted to the TV to a concrete wall, so there were no concerns with Studs. Having said that... having mounted TVs on interior walls where you need to find studs I know this could cause problems. If your TV has 400mm wide mounting holes (VESA 400x200 or 400x400) then you will have to mount the TV exactly between the studs with no room for adjustment because the bracket is only 16" long. If you are worried about the exact position of your TV or have studs wider than 16" (metal framed houses) then you should look for a mount that is wider to allow for more mounting flexibility.

$review_text.: The keyboard is responsive and there are more usb plugs on it but what do you plug into a tablet ? There is a full size sd card slot. Those are the plusses and the only reason anyone would need a keyboard for a touch screen android device.My biggest pet peeve with the whole setup is that the keyboard is heavy and combined the transformer duo is heavier than my Acer netbook .The other point that irks me is proprietary power adaptors that cost triple what a regular usb would've cost and they (Asus)  didn't send one with the keyboard you have to use the one from the tablet.All in all I would have gone with the Toshiba tablet or the Samsung galaxy if I didn't get such a deal on the Transformer tablet itself.The keyboard has sat on the corner of my desk since i got it because it is so cumbersome Iguess I just needed another $100 paperweight.Update 1/13/2012I have been using the keyboard for a while now and getting use to it so I had to give it another star for extending battery life and holding up the unit without buying a stand.I definately see the advantages of an Android O.S. versus Windows with instant on and long standby time, also the Android Aplications are so diverse and affordable compared to PC software.The portable hard drive plugged into the usb has made more sense in having USB on the keyboard but I wish Asus had put one on the tablet part as well.

$review_text.: I like a pocket camera, mostly because phone cameras are really only good for recording a fender bender, and because it isn't always convenient to tote a big DSLR around (especially since I keep a long lens in place). I can discreetly pull a pocket camera from my purse and get a close-up of the fabulous anniversary dinner at the swanky restaurant. Or a great shot of me and my sibs at a backyard barbecue.In theory.Problem is, those shots generally require a flash, which I really dislike, so I lose a lot of shots to "dim light-blur." I hate it when that happens. So I lusted for a better pocket camera.I don't care about digital zoom. Megapixels? At this point, unless you're shooting for billboards, anything over 10mp is more than enough. I don't care if a camera has a front facing window to see myself while I apparently take a picture of me. What? And I don't need any auto-upload feature to a social networking site.I want enough sensor punch to work well in dim light. I want it to do a superb job with macro so I can zero in on the food! (I love food shots, such great memories.) I don't want a load of pixel "noise" getting in the way in any circumstance. And I want it to fit comfortably in my pocket or purse.So the Panasonic Lumix enters. After charging the battery, I went into a closet, set the camera on macro and took a closeup of the stitching on a suitcase. As one would expect, the photo was horribly underexposed, practically black. But using graphics software, I lifted the exposure and I was delighted to see that the stitching was in focus. Dark closet. Tiny subject. In focus. Imagine if I cared about the stitching! This is excellent, because my former pocket camera would automatically slow the shutter speed (no choice on my part) to allow enough light to get the shot, but without a tripod, the blur would make the shot useless.I quibble with this -- when I took indoor action shots of my grandson with the camera set on Intelligent Scene (auto-mode), his skin didn't look pixelated, but weirdly mottled. I had much better results by manually selecting the scene. There are many scene options and they all seem to work really well. Even in dim light! And it does a great job of stopping a moving target (did I mention the grandson?).The Lumix is small, about the size of my smart phone, but the view screen is large enough and you can zoom in during playback to make sure you got the shot you want. The controls are self-explanatory and easy to operate. I did not load any of the software into my computer, but simply connected the camera to my PC with the supplied USB and the drivers loaded automatically. Of course it will connect to an ordinary tripod (if one must).Oh, the flash, you ask? It's just as unpleasant as the flash on every pocket camera, although it's a quick couple of flicks to turn it on or off. And using the option to avoid red-eye (instead of full-on flash) dims the flash just enough to be not entirely hideous. Presto!Even at a higher price point, this camera is a great deal. Start shooting!

$REVIEW.: The sound is descent, it's not really loud enough to jam too or listen in your house while cleaning, but they are GREAT speakers, my laptop speakers suck and this worked fantastically for about 3 days then it all the sudden stopped, I think I may have gotten a dud, and amazon is sending me a new replacement one even though I threw away all packaging for this one. This is why I love buying things on amazon, great return policy, SUPERIOR customer support, hope that in a month or so I can make this 5 star review once I have a working unit.EDIT: I've changed the stars from 2-4 because amazon let me send my defective unit back and mailed me a new one. Yes it works great, I use it to hear regular things on my laptop, listen to school lectures, and talk to my hubby on skype, but for music I wouldn't recommend them unless you really needed something portable to listen to your ipod without headphones.

Not satisfied with longevity though.  I have had for a little more than 30 days and the sound is intermittent in one ear.  Perhaps it is a bad pair?  But for the price you wouldn't expect this problem.  I will stick with my $60 headphones over these.

$REVIEW.: Fantom, in my opinion, is an overlooked gem in the world of desktop storage


 I've burned through countless Western Digital, Iomega, and Maxtor (pre- and post-Seagate) drives before finally learning my lesson: none of them are any better than any of the others, and they are all just this side of shoddy

 Granted, I've only been using the Fantom Data Dock II for 3 months, but in that time, it's sat silently on my desk, holding nearly a TB of movies, music, and pictures (I'm using the RAID 1 configuration), returning what I want quickly and without any disturbing grinding or clicking sounds
 I've learned Fantom is a favorite among Mac content creators, and I'm starting to realize why


 Buy their drives

Threw in a terabyte and it self formats.Haven't figured out the programming as its not very Mac compatible


But it records and the cams that come with it see really good up to 25-30 feet in total darkness


There simply isn't a better deal.It shipped in time.Simple to use pre programmed features such as time stamps, switching views, single cam and or multi cam, audio, can use other cams, Ethernet port, VGA port, USB drive

$review_text.: The Dell Streak 7 is a very good choice for those considering tablets.  The price point is very reasonable, as it packs some quality hardware features (4G, Nvidia Tegra dual core cpu, rear and front cameras, ultra thin design, etc).  You do lose a little compared to some other tablets in terms of screen resolution and battery life.  However, I believe Dell's goal here was to produce a nice tablet that was affordable.  At $199 (2 year TMO contract) it is a steal, and Amazon also has a non-contract WiFi version page up showing a $379 price.Overall - you have to make a decision regarding tablet size.  10 inches obviously gives you a larger viewing area, but its not as portable or easy to type on.  The 7 inch size is extremely portable, easy to thumb type on, and is a great size for those with kids.  As a laptop replacement (even though IMO no tablet is a true laptop replacement yet) I would go with a 10 inch.  However, for those who view tablet's a supplementary device a 7 inch screen is a good choice.

$REVIEW.: I received the package within less than 72 hours from purchase

The battery was mailed in an anti-static sleeve, in a silver bubble-wrap sleeve, in a bubble-wrap bag, in a bubble-wrap orange shipping envelope
So why are ALL of the corners bent? The battery must have been damaged before it was shipped because all the bubble-wrap must have made it impossible to bend the corners of the product while in the mail
Also, my MacBook says it is fully charged and the five lights on the battery will all light up but when I unplug the laptop the battery is only at 10%

Lastly, it does not match the finish of the MacBook which does not necessarily bother me but when you put that together with the bent corners (which make it a struggle to get it locked into place) and the charge problem I am highly disappointed with the product.

$REVIEW.: If you have a Baofeng UV-5R this is the antenna you want
The stock antenna is good on 440 (resonant), but it's just awful for 2 meters
This Nagoya antenna stacks up well against the big Diamond SRH77CA antenna, and against my all time favorite (VX-3R stock antenna) in performance, but it's a lot more practical than either of those since it is only 8&#34; long, is very flexible, and unlike the other two, does NOT need an adapter to fit the radio


Also, unlike other replacement antennas for the UV-5R, it actually fits the radio and doesn't leave any significant gap.Remember that ultimately, ALL rubber duck antennas are lousy antennas, so all you can hope for is decent performance, reasonable size, and flexibility, and this has all of those


You can't do better at any price, and it's cheap

So buy it and you will be happy.

$review_text.: Micro 4/3 enthusiasts have been raving about the Olympus 45mm since it came out, and it's an OK lens: The images are good, color is good, sharpness, etc. But its barrel is plastic, making the lens feel cheap and flimsy. There's a removable ring on the front that keeps coming loose -- I believe it has to remove to mount the Olympus lens shade; I use a cheap but perfectly adequate shade that screws directly onto the lens. The lens shade has kept this ring from being lost several times already.In low light, my 45mm focus-hunts on my EPL-2; it's OK in bright light, and works fine across the board on my Panasonic G1. The images are fine on either camera, but the lens functions better on the G1, for some reason. However, I don't feel this lens is especially good value given its price of $400.Buy one and if you can get past its cheap feel, you'll be happy. Just be ready to eat the return postage if you don't like it.

If you are in the market for a basic but high-quality system, for the price this is really a no-brainer.  I paired it with some Polk LSI 7's I had and, wow, it did the trick!  Any good speakers will complement this receiver well (see my review on Sony SS B3000's).  I echo what others have said, this is NOT the receiver to get if you are looking for home entertainment or surround sound.  However, if you are looking for a rock-solid two channel receiver at an unbeatable price, this is it.

$review_text.: I guess it's not enough to have an alarm clock that rings at the crack of dawn so that you can swat it off your night stand with involuntary abandon. Now the world revolves around your smartphone and how everything in your life responds to it, at least this reverse dynamic appears to be the logic behind the XtremeMac Luna SST alarm clock since it relies on your iPhone or iPod to take advantage of all its capabilities. Android and Blackberry users can stop reading this review right now. In fact, you need to download the XtremeMac app in order to customize the features of the alarm clock and synchronize it with your device. That includes setting up your alarm, selecting what wake-up music or nature sounds you want to hear when you get up, and activating the nap and sleep timers.It's a simple enough app to use, but it adds another dependency with your Apple mobile device that you just need to accept. If you are not willing, the initial set-up can be a bit laborious because you need to power up the clock before you can even use it (it's not a simple plug-in). The other aspect I didn't care for is the multi-purpose circular control on top of the clock. It handles almost every feature related to sound source, volume, play/pause and FM radio settings. Take note that there are no AM settings available in case those news and talk radio channels are important to you. You can inadvertently change your clock's settings by hitting the circle the wrong way. Once you get past these hurdles, the clock is quite stellar when it comes to the quality of sound and the degree of customization you can experience.The speakers detach in a way that allows couples to wake up to their own personal alarm sounds. Even though it's not clear from the documentation, you can flip the system over and connect a longer cable in order to place the detachable speaker even further away from the clock unit. It also comes with four different dock adapters to accommodate the iPod nano, the iPod touch 2G, the iPod classic, the iPhone 3G and the iPhone 4. I also like the remote control feature since that allows me greater control over the clock settings than the circular control on the clock itself. All in all, the XtremeMac Luna SST alarm clock is exclusively targeted to the Apple device aficionados who can look at their alarm clocks as an extension of their smartphone's functionality. Others need not consider the purchase no matter how discounted.

$review_text.: Skullcandy ear buds are low priced in general, so I started  out with a lower model and the wiring kept getting cut inside, leaving just one bud working after a few months. I would be able to fix this by twisting the cord and messing with it, but I would have to do this constantly each time I wanted to use them and then make sure the cord never moved.Knowing that Skull Candy is a cheap product, I moved on to these guys thinking the extra dollars would translate into a longer lifespan. they lasted about a year and a half, which is about 3x longer than the lower versions, but eventually ran into the same problem.So wanting to try a new brand altogether, I did so (I will not name them here because this section should be related to the product listed, not its competitors).After a few months, someone I live with wanted to borrow my non-skully candy earbuds, so I had to use my titans again.wow, what a difference I noticed right away. Using Titans, the only thing that really came through was the bass. All the other elements of the music that I have listened to countless times was muffled or did not come through at all. The bass simply over powered all the other components of the track.Therefore my conclusion is, if you are listening to something that has only one component, and that is bass, and you wish to pay $30-$40 for the privilege of being able to listen to just that one component, then I would fully recommend this product to you.If you are looking to being able to listen to a track that has multiple components and wish to be able to pick them out from each other, then do not buy Titans.

$REVIEW.: The tablet meets my expectations, but only because I was already aware of its shortcomings before ordering it.  As other reviewers have stated, this is not an iPad.  The screen is not bad at all and good for reading documents in bed.  I've found the best reading app to be the Kindle one, although for comic book CBR files, I'm using the Droid Comic Viewer version 1.3.10.  The YouTube app from the Cruz market really stinks.  The videos are terrible quality, I'm not sure if anything better is available.  So far I would say video is the weakest feature, I actually haven't been able to successfully play a video from the SD card yet, but will keep trying different formats and encode rates.  Photos look very nice in the photo viewer though, it will make a good tool for showing off snapshots on vacation.  In any case, my main reason for purchasing this was as a reader and internet browser.  The included browser seems sufficient in rendering most websites, with the exception of any flash support.  I understand there are other third party browser options, but I have yet to check them out.  Bottom line; for $120 it fits my needs right now.  There are issues with responsiveness and quirks to be sure, but nothing that keeps it from being useful.  I kept my expectations low and was pleasantly surprised.  I'll keep my Kindle for reading outdoors and on long trips, but this will be my new bedside reader.

$REVIEW.: I bought this camera about 4 months ago, and the camera itself is not bad, even without taking cost into consideration.  It isn't the best quality image, but when I go back and look at the video I recorded, I can read the text on signs, moving license plates, whatever happens to be in the frame.  It has a noticeable fish-eye distortion.  If you like the wider angle that provides, that's great.  If not, you might not like it.  The camera has a switch to select between HD and FHD (720p vs 1080p) and I personally like the 720p better because it records more frames per second, which provides a somewhat better picture.  I noticed that when recording at 1080p sometimes the image seemed jumpy or wobbly.  If good quality at 1080p is a must, I would recommend you look for something else.My biggest complaint is that the battery has very poor life at low temps, which is a bit of a shame for an action camera.  I initially bought it intending to record winter sports, so I have to keep it somewhere warm and be selective about when I record.  Well below 0F, don't expect it to last more than a few minutes.  In above freezing temps, it will record for hours on a charge.I've never owned a camera from a premium brand, so I can't really compare to that.  I don't feel the need to find out, unless I can find confirmation that a more expensive camera will work for a significant amount of time at temps much below freezing.

$review_text.: ** UPDATE **I wanted to say I managed to get 11.5hrs of wireless usage on a complete battery charge. I also read the documents closely. You can remove the battery when it dies. Just be sure to note the type of battery and go to a place like Radio Shack or Batteries Plus to get a replacement. The battery is similar to what you find in some models of cordless phones.This headset also works with Media Player Classic, Winamp and Jetaudio. It does not work with RealPlayer.*************In a word ... WOW!!!!  I got this locally because I needed the wireless set ASAP and the taxes added to price was a few pennies different from what the shipping cost would be.The device worked OK out of the box. FAIR WARNING!!!: When Logitech says DO NOT!! put the h760 receiver in a USB slot on the back of the computer or next to another receiver, that is EXACTLY what they mean! I tested this and got lots of interference about 20ft away and total shrieking pain at almost 30ft away. I took the single USB wireless dock I got from my Logitech wireless mouse and KB package and hooked the h760 receiver into that. I then placed that in an elevated spot between two desk shelves that are open on "at least" 3 sides (nothing else would fit in this pot!). I then tested the range again and it was flawless!The sound was higher quality than the clearchat pro wired set I had been using. I needed the wireless set because I have to keep standing up and moving from my desk fairly often! while testing the set, I found that I could insert the charging cable while sitting down to maintain the set and then disengage it when I had to leave the desk. This tactic works great for my needs.As for comfort, it weighs far less then the  wired set I have. (which kept sliding off whenever I turned my head!! Two strips of duct tape fixed that!). The behind-the- head design, while not as padded as the over-the-head version is actually far more comfortable for me. The only real problem I had for comfort was finding the exact tension setting on the band. If you adjust the band when it is between the lower curve of the skull and where the neck begins, you can eliminate the "PINCHING" sensation where the phones rest on the ear itself. DO NOT let it "droop" on your lower neck. When you turn your head constantly it drags, rubs and pulls. This is a very annoying sensation. When you adjust it the other way, the headset just FLOATS! and you can turn your head all over. The headset will STAY and I tested this "vigorously"Similar to other posters, I had to TWEAK the sound output to preserve my hearing. This headset does have very clear and solid sound. If you want a "flagship" headset for fanatical online gaming, then I suggest you get the Logitech G35, G730 or G930. Otherwise this is a very good set for the average user and is well worth the price.I tested this with Teamspeak3 and aside from tweaking the sound settings to eliminate choppiness... I had no problems at all. I also didn't need to use the sound cancel features in the teamspeak chat client. I heard funny hissing noises when those were active, but once I turned those off the headset took over and I had super clear sound.The h760 doesn't have the EQ slider switch like other Logitech models. Instead it has a built-in auto-EQ (this is the best way I can describe it!). When I was switching between voice, game screen and streaming tv, the h760 flawlessly shifted to the correct EQ mode for each application of sound. I have a 7.1 surround sound system and the sound quality from the h760 was so close to what I normally hear through the 7.1 setup, that I have no cause to grumble. The h760 seems to integrate with the realtek sound board quite well.The only oddities I found on this product were a total lack of info about charge time and that the Logitech site is still listing the h760 as being a "pre-order" item. I had to type the model number in the search box to find it because it is not listed with the other headsets. I also noticed the swivel on the mic goes back too far and lightly brushes the neck. IMHO Logitech should correct that by making it stop once the mic is level with the band. That location is well within the auto-mute range of the mic and anything beyond that is a snagging risk. The mic is flexible, but it isn't that flexible! Also this set will fit a small to medium sized head. If you have a large head, I suggest a G series over-the-head model instead. Those are wide enough to fit a large skull.As for charge time.. I managed to get about 4hrs wireless mode from the factory charge... that is pretty good out of the box for a factory charge. At about 4hrs time the power indicator started to fade a little, so I plugged in the charge cable and every thing was fine. At that time, I no longer needed to leave the desk frequently. I suggest charging the h760 for at least 3hrs before you first use it, to make certain the battery is full. REMEMBER!: With the h760 the "solid orange" battery light = fully charged! I need to test it with a total charge to see how much wireless chat time I get... optimized... I am expecting 8hrs at best. I think the helper application (read below) reduces how hard the h760 has to work to get the sound signal and this will increase battery life. There isn't any actual documentation on this application. It just installs and gives you an "about" screen. I did notice better performance once the helper was installed.Quirks: when switching from cable to wireless, there is a slight drop in audio clarity. this is not saying the sound gets bad, it just isn't as loud. there is a fix for this that isn't listed in the documents. Just go to the logitech website, search for the headset model. then click on downloads and support. there is a HELPER application you can install for the headset. once this is done, you can switch back and forth without any drop in volume.

$REVIEW.: Belkin looked like they were abandoning the F8T001 v1, the one which started my Bluetooth adventures.  Drivers weren't current, and while Belkin's tech support is very good (and always available), drivers matter.On a chance, I scored a Linksys Bluetooth adapter, and it was immediately better.  Drivers were more current, and most importantly, I was finally able to get Nokia's PC Suite to work.  3rd party apps, song samples, and especially phone updates are now all available to me.  What's more, I was sync'ing my contacts and calendar from Outlook.Range?  Pretty impressive: with a rough estimate of about 50m from adapter to phone in a corporate setting, fluorescent lights humming and dozens of computers between us, I still had full access to my PC from the phone.  Outstanding.I recommend this adapter over the Belkin, and with current drivers and some patience, you can get your Nokia 3650 working like mine.  And just in case you need it, just ask for me in Amazon's Discussion Boards, and I'll help however I can.Fred

$REVIEW.: I bought my first GPS more than 5 years ago - a Magellan 700 and paid near $1300.  I have had a fair amount of experience using a GPS and when my Magellan started acting up on a recent trip I immediately started my research & within a few days decided to try the new Garmin nuvi 260.  After paying top dollar for my original GPS I wasn't sure I'd like the Garmin.  I was dead wrong! Granted, over the past few years all GPS makers have improved their models even though prices have come down but I can tell you first hand that the 260 is a no nonsense GPS that grabs the satellite signal quickly, & has a great data base, as well as a super easy to use interface.  It has text to speech prompts that warn you in plenty of time when to make turns etc. and it is fun to use.  I made up my mind that I wasn't going to spend an arm and a leg as I did the first time around and for the price I paid for the 260 and seeing the quality of this GPS I am very pleased. I do not need bluetooth,MP3, or audio books and other features in a GPS so if you need those features look elsewhere.  However if you want to be able to go from point A to point B without aggrevation and simple elegance the 260 is the one.  The price point of this unit makes it a steal and the size of the unit makes it super easy to slip into your pocket or bag when you fly somewhere and are going to rent a car or if you go into an eatery and don't care to leave it in the car!
$SUMMARY.: This is the one!

$REVIEW.: When I offered to review this item, I knew that it was one of the low-end units from Magellan and so I didn't hold it to terribly high standards.  I am accustomed to using my Garmin Nuvi 775, which admittely costs a lot more than this one.  I did compare the two but can't really fault this Magellan model for not measuring up to that Nuvi.I can fault it for not measuring up to other units (some from Magellan) that cost about the same.Destinations are entered with a keyboard in alphabetic order (there is no option to change to QWERTY).  The GPS did a good job of guessing and filling in entries from its memory so that it usually wasn't necessary to type in the full street name.  There is an extensive POI database and there are options to display the POI's based on type (E.G. restaurants, gas stations, etc).  The screen can get pretty busy if you choose them all but it will show them.I tried traveling to several POI's and was satisfied with the routing it gave, though I did find one wonky POI in the database.  I asked the unit to take me to the nearest Burger King restaurant, which I knew for a fact was just a few blocks away.  It took me on a roundabout route via expressway and then led me to the middle of an office/apartment complex and proudly announced 'You have arrived!'.  This location was (1) not all that far from where I started, so I don't know why I had to get on the expressway instead of just driving a few blocks...and (2) nowhere near a restaurant of any kind.  This may just be a fluke since other POI searches seemed to work just fine.I did have a bit of a problem with the navigational display.  My Nuvi (and other units I've tried) will display information on upcoming intersections, even if I am not actually going anyplace specific (when there is no route in progress in the unit).  I like being able to see which cross streets are coming up...but this unit simply displayed the name of the street I was actually driving on (well duh, I *knew* that already) instead of telling me the names of streets coming up ahead.The voice directions are clear and easily understood, but there is no pronunciation of the actual street names, it merely says 'Turn left' or 'Turn right', accompanied by a pleasant 'bong' sound. Frankly, if I were looking at purchasing this unit, I'd probably choose the Magellan 1220 instead.  It costs only about 10 dollars more and includes the nice street name voice announcement.All in all this is a good basic GPS.  If you need directions, it will definitely get you where you need to go.  The POI's are nice.  I just feel that there are other units for about the same price that have some really nice-to-have features.

$review_text.: My first impression of 47LW5600. I bought it from Amazon. (The price is nowhere as good as Fry's but we don't have the store here.) I ordered in on Tuesday and it arrived 3 days later. I was a bit nervous about Pilot since I saw some negative reviews but my experience is very positive.I have only played with it for a couple of days. The major minus is the "flashlighting" issue. I understand that many LCD panels have this issue. This tv has this around the edge on one side and around a couple of corners. One minor issue is that the standby light did not come on the second day. Perhaps it was just a glitch. I reset it in the setup and it was fine. I finally decided not to have the standby light. I am using the calibration given in this forum.1) The flashlighting issue is more profound than on my Sony 52XBR4. My other flat screen tv is a 42" Panasonic 720p plasma, which the lg is replacing. (The Panasonic does not have this issue. I think in general this does not occur in plasma tv.)2) The picture quality is very good. I don't think the black level is quite as good the Panasonic but I am just a causal viewer so it is good enough for me. I also think that it compares well to the Sony at 1/3 of the cost. (Sure it is a larger tv and it was a few years back.)3) 2D->3D conversion is quite interesting. I know that it can't do magic but I think it is quite good and I am very happy with the result. The effect is best when you have stationary scenes. For example, its 3D effect is very good during the French Open especially seeing the spectators in the stand.4) I really like the swirl stand and the TV is so thin compare to my Panasonic.5) There is no way for me to use a wired connection so I used the wireless option. I wish they have the "build-in" wireless rather than plugging in the dongle (which is included with the TV). I prefer the build in version so that it doesn't take away a USB slot.6) I like having a headphone jack on the TV.7) The second component connection is very interesting. It only has one connection for a combined video connection. I don't know whether it will degrade the signal. Since I won't be using it, it is not an issue.8) The magic remote is ok. As other have said, it is like the Wii remote. However, it doesn't allow you to calibrate so if you sit to the side, you have to compensate.9) I was not able to get DLNA to work. To be honest, I didn't try very hard. On my LG BD 570, I really don't have to do anything and it picks up the service from my macbook pro. So I expect the same for the LG TV but it did not see it. Since it is unlikely that I would be using this, it is no big deal. (If I really need to use it, I will figure it out.)10) I tried reading a 3D mp4 video file from a thumb drive via the USB connection once, it seems to work.11) The glasses are very light. I understand the con of the passive 3D with resolution being reduced. I watched Tron Legacy 3D via vudu and I think it is very good.12) The TV seems to have a limited size of build-inmemory. I didn't install any new apps and I see that I only 258M.Overall, I give it a B+ taken into account of price and performance.

Then it started taking over much of the processing time even when not connected.  I went to an Apple store and the Genius Bar guy eliminated all files from this previous device.  My laptop ran amazingly faster after that.Then I noticed this Seagate HD backup on Amazon made particularly for the Mac.  Just like my Apple, it just worked.  No sweat, no tears, no hogging the processor.... it just worked.

$REVIEW.: Pros:This is a great hi-performance Motherboard. I have been a system builder for more than 20 years so  it was a fairly easy install for me. First time builders should have very few problems if they follow the manual.  Experienced system builders won't need the manual until the mobo is physically installed tin the case. I did attach the WiFi board first as mentioned in other  reviews.Initially, I used the onborad video vga to set up the system while waiting for my  Asus GT640 card to arrive.  I loaded the &#34;basic&#34; software for the mobo first so I could get into the BIOS at start up, to do some tweaking.  This gave me opportunity to set the RAM Compatibility push-button on the mobo which took a few seconds.Very Small Cons:These are not show-stoppers or red flags:This mobo is BIG it took some time getting into my mid-tower case. The front SATA connectors were somewhat difficult to access in my Antec 500 case. The HD bay sits directly in front of those  connectors.  I pulled my drives out and routed the cables through holes that were in the back of the drive bay. It is a two-hand procedure; one hand to rout the cable just at the point of insertion and the other hand to snap the cable into place. You might want to consider plugging in the SATA cables first just before you mount the mobo.My system:Asus P8Z77-V Pro, Intel i7 Quad-Core over-clocked to 4.3Ghz; Cool Master Hyper 212EVO CPU Cooler; Asus Gt640 2GB DDR 3 PCI 3.0 Video Card factory over-clocked, 32 GB 1.6 Ghz RAM - 12Gb is configured as a RAM Drive; 4 Hard drives totaling 3.64 TB (4 HDs 3 1GB and 1 640GB) two DVD Optical DVD Drives.

The only thing I have to say is that 4 ft is shorter than most Micro USB cables (6 ft seems to be the norm), and to be sure ahead of time that 4 ft is long enough.  I wanted it for my car, so short was good.  However, it is barely long enough to reach from my cpu to the surface of my desk.
$SUMMARY.: Be sure this length will work for you

$review_text.: UPDATE: June 21, 2010The Motorola SB6120 Cable Modem is VERY, VERY FAST when compared to the earlier DOCSIS 2.0 modems --After completing over 1000 connection speed and line-quality tests, the SB6120 gave these results:[...]-- Phoenix to San DiegoAverage Download Speed =  87 Mbps (Maximum = 108 Mbps Download)Average Upload Speed  =  6.1 Mbps. (Maximum =  7.20 Mbps Upload)Latency  = 26-52 Ms.Jitter  =  0-3  Ms.Packet Loss  =  0.0%Setup was very easy, and a quick call to Cox Cable (Phoenix) to activate the MAC addy had me rockin' in the free world in just a few minutes' time !!AND, you DO NOT have to subscribe to the high-priced DOCSIS 3 package in order to get some terrific speeds -- I'm on a 20/2 package, but even the "local" speeds are super -- WITHOUT the increase in monthly costs !!The SB6120 has paid for itself long ago, and now it's ALL GRAVY !!!I highly recommend this modem -- AND the use of Category 6 (Shielded) Ethernet Cables to connect to your Computer and/or your Gigabit Router.The SB6120 Modem feeding a D-Link DIR-655 Xtreme N Gigabit Router and the D-Link DWA-522 XtremeN (PCI for PC) Adapter (also available at Amazon.com) are capable of speeds and line-quality that the more common Category 5 cables cannot match.Protect your wireless home network from interference caused by microwave ovens, motors, printers, large appliances, etc. --- Category 6 shielded Ethrnet cables are also available at Amazon.com -- at a true value price -- and WELL worth the money !!One other thing:Insure that your internet connection is fully optimized by the use of a top-quality Network Interface Card (NIC). I have gotten solid, stable connections and super-speeds since installing the Intel PRO/1000/GT -- it's a 10/100/1000 NIC that can handle ANY speeds that can flow off the internet.Don't worry about installation -- It's so easy, a cave-man can do it !!*UPDATE* -- 9 April,'12 --Running continuously with FLAWLESS performance for nearly 3 years with NO loss of signal and no re-booting required !Tips:1.- Unit runs coolest when mounted one-half-inch away from a wall with wires pointing straight down.2.- To combat network equipment interference, keep your cable modem and your wireless router at least 4 feet apart.

$REVIEW.: What should be a nifty device, simply isn't. I have tried using it with three different wired ethernet devices (a DVD player, a cable box, a PC, and a networked AVR) and in each case it won't maintain a steady long term connection suitable for streaming music or watching movies. It's erratic, sometimes it works sometimes it breaks up a lot. My wireless network is excellent and ALL my other devices work just fine on wireless in the same location (including streaming movies etc). It's just this device that has the problem.I need to find something else that does the same job, or maybe I'll just string a cable beneath my house.

$review_text.: I originally purchased the Lighting to VGA adapter for use with an iPad mini but found the quality was horrible when it came to the detail and color quality of pictures. For demoing apps, etc it was fine, but not for multimedia display. With this adapter and an iPad 3 on the same display, the picture was ALOT clearer. Full 1080p, quality perfect. There is only one issue however, you can't charge the iPad and use this adapter at the same time. yes, thats right, no pass-though power. So its good for short presentations I guess, but not good for long term use since your iPad will die, and you will have to unplug this adapters in order to change it up again.

$review_text.: I've gone through a few of these protectors and I still think they're excellent and I highly recommend.  The only bummer is since they snap on, that means they can also snap off.  That's how I've managed to lose two in the past; I've just been walking around while on vacation, with my camera over my shoulder and it's bumped something causing the protector to pop off and I've lost it. There's one somewhere in New Hampshire and one floating in the Caribbean Sea. (Yeah, bummer)Anyway, the protector is plastic, but is of great quality.  For a few bucks you can't go wrong.  I live in IL and these ship from CA.  It arrived really quick (in 3 business days) and just in time for my next vacation.  ...Here's hoping I won't lose it again. :)

$REVIEW.: I ordered this, hoping that it would fit my brand new 7G 160GB iPod.  It does. Apparently the iPod is a little thinner than the previous 160GB, requiring a rubber shim (included) in the back of the case.  To my mind this is a good thing, since it gives the iPod a little more cushioning.  Some may complain about the bulk, but it's no larger than my old 60GB in its case.  It will still fit easily in a pocket.Protection looks good.  The screen protector has a little gasket to keep it from scratching the screen.  We'll see how that works over time, but it appears to stay in position without slipping around.  I have no trouble operating the click wheel either.  The belt clip has a sturdy spring along with a quick-release button.Like most other cases on the market, you'll have to remove this one if you intend to use the iPod in a dock.  Not a problem for me, but it might be for others.  My need was for a tough case that would allow me to operate the iPod without having to open a front cover.  So far, so good.Update, Aug 27, 2010: I finally got the test I'd dreaded as my iPod hit the floor.  It fell about three feet onto industrial carpet (concrete 1/4" beneath) and then took a bounce.  After uttering some unpleasant language, I took the iPod home and ran a number of tests (including a full surface check with TechTool Pro).  No errors and so far, no misbehavior.  A fall like that can crack a circuit board, which will typically manifest itself in intermittent errors.  That may turn up over time, but at this point my faith in this case has been strengthened and I'm raising my rating from 4 stars to 5.

$review_text.: I got the 360 based on experience with my wife's 660. I was going away on a stateside assignment in the military and quickly got tired of not knowing where I was going in the new state.The 360 is basically the 660 but without widescreen or the traffic receiver, the latter of which you have to pay a subscription for and is only useful if you commute on major roadways. The 360 screen is the same height as the 660 screen, just narrower. I really don't find there to be any big advantage with the extra width and I kind of like that the unit is smaller when carrying it or shoving it in the glovebox. For the record my wife prefers the widescreen, but that's all she's ever used.Enough glowing words have been written about both units that I won't heap on more, but I have to say that the Nuvi mounting system leaves a lot to be desired.On my wife's 660 the mount broke at the cup part of the cup/ball attachment point within a few short weeks. In its defense, my wife is not terribly mechanically inclined and for a while thought that you had to detach the unit at this mechanism. (Actually there is a quite ingenious little tab you can see in the picture of the unit where your thumb pushes in the tab on the bottom while your other four fingers sit on the top and the unit slides right out of the mount, easy as pie.) Still, I don't think the ball joint should have broken so easily.We chalked it up to her misunderstanding, but now I've had the 360 for barely a month and the mount (pretty much identical to the 660 mount as far as I can tell) broke in a spot where it definitely should not have. You can see in the picture that the suction cup and mounting arm articulate around a silver metal tab on either side of the suction cup. The part of the suction cup that the metal tab rides in cracked on both sides simultaneously from no more than average swiveling of the unit up and down to achieve the proper viewing angle as I installed it each time getting into the car.Now I am researching buying a new mount. Disturbingly, I am finding numerous postings saying that the suction cup (of the replacement mounts, at least) has a bad tendency to weld to the glass in hot sun, never to come off without destroying the suction cup beyond any future use and leaving a good amount of rubber stuck to the window that requires extensive razor scraping to remove.Not sure what I am going to do; go with a Garmin replacement suction mount, a Garmin beanbag mount, or an aftermarket version.To recap, I am very happy with the 360 (and my wife's 660 for that matter) but I am very UNhappy with the mounts on either one.

$review_text.: I can't really write enough about what a good value this bundle is
 I had always been one to discredit Bose products as nothing more than Logitech products with a fancier name slapped on them, but after using this bundle, my opinion of Bose has taken a total 360


 The speakers are the best thing I've ever heard from speakers that size, and actually better than any bigger speakers that I've ever owned as well


 They produce a very deep base, and unbelievably crisp sound, wayy  better than anything I've ever owned in the past


 I had to upgrade my Spotify subscription to Spotify Plus to get the upgraded sound, as I could actually tell the difference with these speakers
 Another benefit is that they get so loud, that I can turn them all the way up, and have a party in any room of the house without having to move them


 I was SHOCKED how loud they got.As for the other part of the bundle, I basically just consider that a bonus as the speakers alone are worth the asking price
 The headphones are not the best I've ever used, but are definitely not bad

 The overall sound quality is superb, but the bass is a little lacking (in my opinion)


Also, I prefer the traditional earbuds that go in your ears as opposed to this style
Nevertheless, they stay on very well, and do indeed sound good


 They aren't anywhere near as loud as the speakers, but that's probably a good thing for your ears!!Overall, if you're in the market for a nice set of computer speakers, I highly recommend these
 It seems weird that there's no subwoofer, but after hearing them, trust me, no subwoofer necessary!!  Feel free to post any questions on the product, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can!

$review_text.: I purchased this BD player more for the fact that it has two HDMI out jacks (currently very rare) than the 3D capability, which I'm not currently using. I have a Denon 4806 receiver that I paid an arm and a leg for a few years back that unfortunately only passes 1080i through it's HDMI system. I wanted to be able to get 1080p out to my TV while still enjoying the lossless HD sound through HDMI, and the dual outputs here solved that perfectly (HDMI splitters didn't work and I don't want to use analog out connections).Besides the obvious draw of it's 3D playback capability, the C7900 is pretty full featured player. It has built-in wireless and ethernet adapters for internet connectivity, which includes Netflix, Blockbuster, YouTube, Facebook, Pandora and a ton of others apps that are currently available. You can actually add and remove them as you see fit. Pretty impressive. Netflix streaming was excellent over wireless even with HD content and the Pandora worked perfectly too. I did not try the other apps yet. It can also update firmware from the web, with auto-notification if desired, and it prompted me to update when I did the initial setup which went without a hitch. There's internal 1GB of storage for BD-Live stuff (actually only about 600MB free out-of-the box though) or you can use the USB jack in the front for it (no rear jack). The USB also allows for reading media from thumbdrives, etc. Picture and audio quality are excellent, with the usual adjustments and presets available to you. Boot-up is almost instantaneous and BD disc loading speed (with and without Java) is super-fast, seemingly quicker than my Playstation 3.Build quality is good. It's a small form factor, button-less front face, with a pretty cool see-through top over the disc drive area. It's illuminated, along with a 3D BD logo, with dynamic white LED's (which can be turned off if desired) and the touch-sensor transport buttons (stop, play/still, eject and power) along the front top edge of the player. The remote is non-illuminated and is pretty comfortable to hold with nicely laid-out flat buttons. Connectivity jacks are 2 HDMI out (1 audio only), 1 component and 1 composite video, 1 L/R RCA audio out, 1 optical audio out, 1 ethernet and 1 front USB jack (behind a little swing out cover). The player gets warm underneath, but it didn't feel out of the ordinary to me.The nitpicks I have with this player are minor. You can only dim the front panel display, not turn it off completely. The on-screen display doesn't tell you the type of audio track going out (just MULTI-CH). A coaxial audio out would've been nice as an option to optical. Other than that if you're willing to pay a little premium for the 3D, this player is well worth consideration.

These plugs not only adapt a US 3 prong plug they also accept an additional 2 prong plug on the side.

$REVIEW.: This item was given to me for my reviewThe Moshi iVisor XT for the Kindle Fire HD 7# is an easy to install screen protector, even for a butterfingers like me

After I wiped down my Kindle screen with the Moshi cloth (included), I just needed to align the two little holes of my Kindle with the screen protector and set the item in place

Once the screen protector was in place, it was FIRMLY in place


The Moshi protector is not visible to the naked eye, so the only way you know that it is there, is that the screen is not as slick as it was before

When you slide your finger to unlock your Kindle, you will find that the screen surface has more grab than it did before
The new surface takes some getting used to, but it does provide some benefits
I found I have more control over where my finger is and where it stays
On the other hand, my screen is not as sensitive to touch as it was before I applied the protector....And, again, this is both good and, if not bad, at least requires adjustments on my part


I do like the sturdiness of the material the screen protector is made out of


I use my Kindle constantly, and I think this will help lengthen the Kindle screen's lifespan
After only a week of use, I cannot say how the screen protector will fare in the long term, so I will just have to update it in a few months' time

My first impressions are that it is a good, sturdy product for the price, and it will protect my Kindle screen's surface.

Once connected this amazing device delivers in a stunning fashion.  Most of the media content I "consume" comes from the internet (podcasts, YouTube, Flickr, etc). so imagine the feeling of being able to enjoy this from the living room rather than being tethered to a computer.Of course you have access to your iTunes library (music, movies, video, podcasts, etc.) and the sweet thing is that you're not limited to the content of a single computer.  You can access the content of multiple computers - how cool is that!A nice feature is being able to get media without having to have a computer on, such as Flickr, YouTube, and Podcasts. Nice!I've already decided to get a 2nd Apple TV, this time the 160gb model.My world changed when I hooked this device up and I'm not going back.P.S.You can buy and rent movies from the iTune store.

$review_text.: I bought this to replace a previous Thermaltake cooler that I couldn't afford the replacement cable to. I was happy to see that it uses a standard USB cable for power instead of the previous model which used a non-standard power cable. However, I was disappointed to see that instead of heavy-duty metal design throughout like the previous model, this model is made mostly of plastic. The upside to this is that it is not heavy at all, however I would have preferred the sturdy feeling of metal better. This is also fairly slim, so I would imagine that it could fit inside a laptop bag pretty well. Overall, it seems to work to keep my laptop cool, and does so quietly, so I certainly still recommend it.

$REVIEW.: I run a mobile development company so I "need" to own every tablet format that comes out. iPad 3 is my main device but I own ipad 1 and 2 and mini and nexus 7 as well as the original KF. The Kindle Fire HD (7") is a great value and it is definitely the best at certain things but not the best tablet on the market over all. It is amazing for reading and watching hulu and Netflix and HBO. I think that's what most people do wit a tablet and this is the best tablet I've used for those things...I'll start with reading. The very gripable size and high rez screen make it good. Integrated Kindle book store makes it really good.  Unbelievable Text-to-Speech TTS through loud, clear speakers makes it the best on the market. You can read a book while you're at home, then when you have to drive to work, push play and it will read itself to you loudly and clearly from the exact spot you were at. The old Fire couldn't do this at all.  The old kindles could, but the voices were crappy.  This one is the most amazing TTS I've ever heard and this feature alone makes it worth owning.Other advantages of the fire: best speakers on any tablet, by a wide margin. Not sure why no one else seems to be able to pull this off, but the difference is remarkable.  Compared with any ipad or the super weak nexus 7 speakers, the Fire HD sounds like a home theater. It makes watching TV way more fun.Downsides: not the most solid-feeling construction. Not as many apps (though it has the most important ones). The web experience isn't as good. Also, the home screen interface is totally unintuitive and terrible. It doesn't bother me, since I only use it for reading and TV, but worth a mention.Regarding the "special offers" they don't bother me one bit. I buy everything on Amazon anyway so deals are fine with me.The Kindle Fire HD is not the best tablet for everyone, but if you like reading and watching shows, it's pretty tough to beat at any price.
$SUMMARY.: Fire HD is the best for reading, watching TV, if that's what you need

$review_text.: I really like this camera.  I've had it a little over a month now, and have taken hundreds of pictures.  Basically, the major negative in my mind is the lack of an optical viewfinder for use when it is really bright outside.  However, the 6x zoom is wonderful, and the image stabilizer overcomes all other complaints.  It is wonderful!  I have had a couple of times where it struggled to auto-focus on a close-up (macro) subject, but not too bad.  For the price I paid, I couldn't have done better.

$REVIEW.: I bought this to use with my Kindle

 My first disappointment was how huge this is

 I had another splitter that was about 1/10 the size, there's no reason it has to have all that extra bulk
 My second disappointment was that it doesn't even work with my Amazon Kindle


 The Kindle does not recognize it


 It does work if I connect to my laptop, but there's a loss of volume of what seems to be about 80%


I mean with this thing the volume is about 1/5 of what it is if I plug in directly


 So ..


pretty useless for audio purposes unless you can crank the volume way up

 But if I turn it to max on my laptop, it's still too low.

$REVIEW.: Cons : Inconsistent performance, No Playon, No JustinTVPros : None found yet!Where shall I begin....I had a Roku 1 I had purchased at a local Wally-World...In the Roku forums I was informed by many that Wally had ripped me off and sold me a defunct box...That I should HURRY and return it and get me a new one, since they are the same price...First off, the old Roku 1 from Wally did work fine...PlayOn worked fine, as did JustinTV. Which are 2 really major channels for me...See I don't really get into the 1930's and 1940's movies that Roku offers in their "free" assortment of channels. Hey if you don't mind it, great. More power to ya...But I like my TV in color every once in a while, ya know! Gullible me figured, heck yeah, I want the newest! Hurried back to Walmart and returned my poor lil' ol' Roku 1(I am so glad now I didn't get ugly with them when I returned their OLD OUTDATED ROKU)OK here we go...sets up just like the old one, except only uses wireless to connect to your router(I have a 2 wire and AT&T; Elite DSL) No issues there...I get my channels set up and all and go to JustinTV...and this is what I get on all channels...Error is "playback has ended"Okaaay...Not good but maybe I can deal with this through PlayOn, which I had also installed...Well, it gets to PlayOn and all, goes thru the folders and all, but can't stream it...I am SCREWED I see this now...Now it's time to call Roku for assistance....Oh lord....Not India....Yeah, Roku has outsourced their jobs to India! So in a nutshell, calling Roku is just like calling HP or any other big American company that doesn't feel Americans here need jobs!My botton line on Roku2...The new Roku 2 box sucks, in my opinion. It makes PlayOn&JustinTV; useless....And to me, those are my main goto channels...Roku, you let this rat out of the box too soon. Did y'all even do any testing on this box before you released it? Did you even try hooking it up to an actual tv and try it out? Besides the ability to add a memory card , it just BOMBS! I want my money back so I can go try to find an old box before everyone figures out how suckie this new box is and buys up all the old ones...Boo Roku.

$review_text.: I wanted two desktop features: 1) Wireless and 2) Split ("ergonomic") keyboard. I've been using the "Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop Pro" keyboard and mouse combo (ASIN=B0000AOWVP) for a couple of years, and have been pretty happy. However, my old desktop set was starting to show its age, so an upgrade to the Desktop 7000 looked good. Since I've got somewhat large hands, the idea of a "baseball" mouse has appeal. And this newer keyboard seems to be well-received. It costs more, so it's probably better, right?Here's my reaction:There was one VERY ANNOYING problem, and other reviews have commented on it also: Mouse lag. This was not, as some have suggested, a matter of the USB receiver being too far away. I placed the USB receiver less than 2 feet from the mouse. I have no reason to believe my hardware was defective or that there was any external reason that might have caused the mouse to function less than optimally. I suppose it's possible my problem was local, but I don't see how. The lag was sporadic, and I noticed it in particular with the scroll wheel. That is, I start to spin the wheel, and there's a distinct pause. So I stop and start my wheel spin, and then it picks up, as if it had gone to sleep and needed a poke. I'm guessing this is some sort of a power-saving optimization, where it hibernates and takes a moment to awaken. This is a small thing, but it annoyed me; I found myself developing a sort of nervous twitch every time I accessed the scroll wheel, so as to kick it out of its slumber. It interfered with my easy use of the PC.Otherwise, I found the keyboard and mouse no better than my old Wireless Optical Desktop Pro. The baseball mouse was okay but didn't really make my mousing more comfortable in long use; the keyboard has some supplemental keys and controls, but nothing that mattered to me.So I'm back with my older desktop. I found no reason to prefer this desktop, and a big reason to avoid it. Maybe it's a good choice for others; some people don't seem to encounter the mouse lag, and maybe they like the baseball mouse and the different keyboard. The question is somewhat subjective; there's no way to know unless you try. But my experience wasn't satisfactory.

$review_text.: The Lowepro Scope Photo Travel(tm) 350 AW camera/optics backpack is everything I expected, and much more! Lowepro has always made high quality camera bags, and this professional backpack is no exception. Attention to detail and build quality are top tier; you'd be hard pressed to find anything better even among the boutique items. All of the seams are even and tight, the zippers are strong, oversized for durability, and work smooth as butter.Comfort? Holy Guacamole, Avocado Man! Just like all my other Lowepro bags, the straps are so comfortable you can trek through the wilderness all day long and not be bothered. I loaded this bag down with my Nikon D300, a couple telephoto lenses, a spotting scope, hotshoe flash, and a bunch of accessories. Everything was held securely in place, and the seperate velcro enclosed compartments within the main storage area made sure everything stayed in place, even when opening the bag from an upright position. Well done Lowepro! Even with all that weight on my back, it just doesn't feel fatiguing at all, due to the ample soft padding on the straps.There is room for all kinds of accessories, from a slot for a laptop computer, to tons of pockets for everything from field guides, light meters, batteries, memory cards, keys, flashlight, multi-tool, and still yet you can count on having a place to strap your tripod on too! The nylon exterior is very durable, and the padded compartments are among the best I've seen. It would take a lot to damage anything in this bag, along the lines of extraordinary circumstances.One thing I really love is the holder for the super-telephoto lens. It only opens halfway down, and sewn closed on the bottom half. This means you can open the bag in an upright position and not worry about your DSLR and $10k optics going tumbling out onto the ground. This is a huge, huge benefit with this backpack, something that gives the photographer a lot more peace of mind when trying to access their gear in a hurry.There is even Lowepro's famous rain cover built into the bottom of this backpack, so if the weather starts getting ugly, you won't have to worry about your gear getting wet. Lowepro really thought of it all with this bag, it is an excellent solution to the needs of the professional nature/wildlife photographer.Try as I might, I just can't find anything to ridicule about this bag. It's built to last, of Lowepro's high quality standards. Exceptionally well thought out and designed for its purpose. I couldn't have asked for anything better.

I drive a 2005 Honda Civic and I grease the dash down with Armorall pretty good ... this mount does not slip.  I drive like a complete idiot too, according to my wife and kids, so they give this thing props for staying put too.  Speaking of Armorall, it does leave a dry spot on the dash; I guess that's the "footprint" some other people were talking about, but if you don't grease it down like me then that won't happen.  If you get a Nuvi GPS and you're curious about the best method for keeping the thing in one place, this is your answer.  I stuffed all the little suction cups and double-sided tape in a drawer because this is all a guy (or gal) needs.

$review_text.: Mounted in ASUS P6T Deluxe V2 motherboard on the white (secondary) PCIe x16 slot.  Running in AHCI mode, I set AHCI to use an SSD before buying this card (so the computer was already ready for it). You MUST be in AHCI mode to use this card. I did this in W764 post install. That's work, but can be done, probably better to just always set AHCI preinstall anyway, considering where storage is going. Its drivers loaded no problem. It recognizes insertion and removal of USB and SATA components as it should (hot). Currently running a WD VRap SATA III on this card as my data drive. Noticeably faster than SATA II VRaps on the onboard controller. I don't RAID anything so I can't comment on that. 80MB PSD file loads into Photoshop CS4 in what I estimate to be less than 250ms. Having Photoshop scratch on the SSD helps a lot with that and all other PS operations.

$review_text.: I recently bought the Slingshot 302AW, hoping to be able to carry two bodies (and some extra lenses and accessories) and still enjoy the fast access of a sling bag.But I cannot find the right configuration for this bag. It is big enough, but the freedom to arrange the internal space is very limited.The main limit is the fixed divider between the upper and the lower compartments.The upper compartment is just a little too small for another body (Sony A700 with VG or Minolta Maxxum 9 with VG with wide-normal lens).The lower compartment is too big for one body, but a little too small for two bodies.After some tries, I managed to fit two bodies in the lower compartment (although the Velcro is very limited), but then I have no fast access to my equipment and I have to take the bag off to get something out.So I don't really understand this bag - if I want fast access for one body, I'll use a smaller bag. If I am giving up the option for fast access and carry two bodies, I will use backpack which is way more convenient.I feel very frustrated - I like this bag, it is very sturdy and comfortable. It is big and has the potential to be exactly what I am looking for. But it is not...AFTER READING THE COMMENTS TO MY REVIEW:This bag might not be designed to carry two bodies. That's true. But the complain is about the fact that the bag is big and has a lot of space, and yet there is no enough space for a setup I can carry with a much smaller bag. Each photographer has his/her own style and his/her own kit. That's why most of the modern camera bags contains dividers that can be moved around. Before I bought that bag I checked how much space it has and I mistakenly assumed that I will be able to use this space as I wish. That is the usual case with camera bags (at least that is the case with the other Lowepro models I own).In that sense, the older versionLowepro SlingShot 300 All-Weather Camera Bag (Black)is better because you can attach the dividers anywhere in the main compartment.

$review_text.: These are my favorite.  While a tripod was essential when I shot Hasselblad, now that I am shooting a DSLR, I rarely use a tripod.  But, It is always good to have the option while on the job.So, I attached this either directly onto a light stand, or I use an adapter (Manfrotto 026 Swivel Lite-Tite Umbrella Adapter) that allows changing the tilt.If you buy a remote for your camera, you can easily get a birds-eye-view by mounting this on a 12' light stand.
$review_summary.: Use this, and no more tripod!

$review_text.: I just purchased these for $58.99. The price alone made me take the leap for a new pair of headphones for my iPod. They sound great. I haven't used them enough to hear too much bass as some of the reviews report. I was originally looking at Monster Diddybeats and Monster Beats by Dr. Dre. All three have the same retail price of $179.95. The only thing the Turbines are missing is the tangle-free flat cable. I can't complain for the price. As a reminder, do not buy any Monster products on the Internet unless you're buying from an Authorized Monster Internet Dealer like Amazon.com. Don't be fooled. Many Internet sellers will say they are authorized Monster dealers, but they are not. If you are a fan of Monster Cable and their quality products you will like these headphones even if they are $100+. I highly recommend them.

$review_text.: When my headphone jack on my Droid X stopped working, I went to Verizon for advice. They offered two options: pay full price for a new phone or receive a refurbish phone for $99 from the insurance plan I'd been paying on for over a year.Since I babied my phone from day one - in almost 18 months it has never been dropped or struck or mistreated in any way -I was reluctant to get a refurbished phone that might result in more problems. And I wasn't prepared to pay $600 for a new phone since my contract ends in less than 6 months and I'll be able to get a substantial reduction in price with a new contract.I opted to do without headphone music. It was only fiddling with the phone one day that I noticed the bluetooth option. I had never used it before and I'm surprised Verizon didn't mention it.A quick search at Amazon gave me many bluetooth headphone styles. I wanted something light and inconspicuous. After reading reviews, decided on this set. So far, I am happy with the purchase.The LG Tone HBS-700 synced right away to my phone. The headphones themselves are very lightweight. The buds are extremely comfortable and this is coming from someone who normally doesn't like earbuds. Maybe my ear canals are too small, but I can never find a good fit with ear buds. With this set, the buds are soft enough that you can adjust them comfortably.The buds separate from the main frame of the headphones so, except the small black wire going from your neck to your ear, the headphones are virtually unnoticeable. When you pack them away, the buds magnetically seat themselves back into the main set.I also like that the volume is fairly loud. I'm hard of hearing, so some headphones that might be fine for a person with normal hearing can be frustrating faint for me. These headphones are plenty loud enough for me to enjoy my music and chat on the phone.The packaging is also worth noting. It is basically a hard clear box with a plastic hinge. With the packaging, you have a proper protective storage box for the headphone and the re-charger.I do have two things I wish were different. When the buds are seated in the set, I wish they were at a 90 degree angle so you could, as an option, wear them like a stethoscope for easy off and on without having to remove and re-seat the buds. And second, I wish there was a balance control. Maybe its just my poor hearing, but it does sound like the volume of one bud is slightly lower than in the other.Over all, I am happy with the headphones. They make an even better replacement for the traditional plug-in headphones than I expected.Four stars instead of five because, for the price, they could be a better quality.

$review_text.: Well-just opened and set the camera up. I have at least 8 cameras and this is really amazing. I guess the slr's are better, but this is pretty close for a small compact. I mean small! You could lose this in a suit pocket! Anyway I shot it in many functions -it is allot like the Sony NEX 3 I have, menu wise. Pretty intuitive. It also shoots great macro shots-also very close to my 60d Canon with a 1.8 50mm on it-also amazing. The new technology Sony is developing is so far out there just in 1 year. Low light it'sgood set at 800iso. Did some pixel peeking and the shots were very good-you need to push the camera and explore the settings.I shoot without flash whenever possible, and the colors are quite true. This will be with me quite a bit-probably in my carry bag all the time. Put a light wrist cord on it as it's that small to hold. Less than 100.00 and it beats cameras up to 500.00. I checked them out by doing the wx50vsother cameras in google. There are not many that beat it for sharpness and overall performance. It is a well kept secret. Wish you could see the shots-I'll put some on flicker-Jeff Bissell-take a look. Was bought on Amazon-they are good at any returns within 30 days.

$REVIEW.: The drive quickly and easily added 1TB to my MacBook Pro once I made some modifications to Western Digital's setup process. The drive is totally silent, no vibration, and the glossy finish looks nice. My drive came with a small scuff on it that wouldn't come off the plastic finish, but wasn't a big deal.The area WD needs to improve is in SOFTWARE. Every single time you plug this drive in, it mounts a virtual CD on the desktop. You can't turn it off with the drive software. To remove it, you literally have to drag the icon to the trash every single time (reformatting the drive doesn't work either, it still mounts the CD!). It took some time on Google to find out that WD has a utility to unmount it permanently for both Windows and Mac - it's buried within their site. Downloading this utility and running it FINALLY got rid of the CD icon on my desktop. Frustrating!WD also provides backup software, but it just isn't anywhere as nice as Time Machine on the Mac or the integrated backup solution for Windows 7. There are also drivers you can install to replace the stock icons on the desktop with WD icons showing how much of the drive is being used. These were the least invasive of WD's software, but added no real value to the drive. It's awesome that you can encrypt the entire drive, but to do so you must use WD's software, which I was unwilling to do after the constant irritation it causes.That's 3 DIFFERENT pieces of software to configure. To use a USB hard drive. And one of them you can't find without some serious searching. That's about 3 too many for me!The status LEDs on the drive itself are a bit wonky too. There are four LEDs to indicate how much drive space has been taken up. 1. They ONLY work if you install the WD software, otherwise they just stay dark. 2. Even when they're on, they make zero sense.You might think with 4 LEDs, that as you filled the drive up, they would light (and stay lit)... kind of like filling up a glass with water. The more data on the drive, the more LEDs are lit. This is NOT the case. LED 1 is 0%-25%. LED 2 is 25%-50%. You see where this is going. Only a SINGLE LED stays lit, and from any more than 6 inches away you can see WHICH LED is lit: 1, 2, 3, or 4. Could have been a neat feature, but again, the crazy software killed it.To make this drive useful and not frustrating I ended up removing ALL Western Digital software from my Mac, reformatting the drive with Disk Utility, removing the auto-mount feature, giving up on use of the LEDs on the front, and letting Mac OS manage the backups and the drive itself.Once you remove all trace of Western Digital software, you're left with a normal, small-ish, quiet hard drive that works great for backups and storage, and looks nice!The basic drive gets 5 STARS. The software gets none.
$SUMMARY.: Good drive in spite of Western Digital's software, NOT because of it.

$REVIEW.: FM TUNER(UPDATE #2)I sent my Rio back for a refund.  The unit consistently shuts itself down whenever I press a button.  This started happening after a couple of weeks and Rio said the contacts weren't making good contact.  Rio support fixed the problem when they fixed the FM problems, so I thought it was specific to just my unit.  After hearing so many others complain about this problem, plus it has begun occuring again in my unit, I think people ought to know about it.  The same issues have been stated concerning the 256MB version.(UPDATE) -- Rio fixed their FM problems by adding a capacitor to the unit.  The FM tuner is now acceptable, pulling in almost as many stations as the IRiver ifp-790 I compared it to.  I would say the Rio, with the fix, is about 90% as good as the IRiver FM tuner.(PREVIOUS)The FM tuner sucks. Sorry there is no other way of putting it. I went into the top floor of my house and compared it to my clock radio. I am about 25 miles outside Albany NY and the clock radio pulled in 12 FM stations very clearly. The Forge pulled in 3 stations clearly, the other 9 were so weak they were unlistenable. When the backlight is on, these 3 stations are unlistenable until it goes off. To top that off, once going downstairs and outside for a run, the Forge pulled in ZERO stations clearly. That's right, when I go for a run I can not listen to ANY FM stations, without loads of static.I brought the Forge to work with me (downtown Albany), and the FM tuner pulls in 6 stations very clearly. I took it around the block and the 6 stations all stayed clear. It seems that if you are close to a big city, live in a big city, or are near an FM tower, you should be fine with the Forge FM tuner, otherwise pretend like the FM tuner doesn't exist.MemoryClearly the 128 MB version is not big enough and I will soon be getting a 1GB SD card. This option is what is keeping me from returning the Forge. The IRiver doesn't have the expandable memory and unless you want to keep running to your computer every day to reload playlists, you need a lot of memory.PlaybackVery good. Quality is excellent, even at the lowest sampling rates.HeadphonesDefinite thumbs down. They fell out twice while doing my 5 mile run. Let me clarify, the headphone for my right ear fell out twice, the left stayed nicely in. The slightest tug is enough to slowly move the earphones out of position. Another 12" of cord might alleviate this problem. Regardless of their quality (which is so-so), they must be replaced.StopWatchThis is why I bought the Forge. Well it's OK, but the lap counter only shows the last two laps you completed, and I haven't figured out how, if there is a way, to view previous lap times. Then I noticed if you take out the headphones from the player ( I did this when the cord got tangled) the stopwatch stops. In fact the whole Forge stopped - its as though the headphones are wired to the power and the player shuts down when the headphones are removed (this royally screwed up my time, but I won't do it again).It also sucks because while the StopWatch is running and you go to player mode, if you touch the lap counter, it doesn't work - you HAVE to be in StopWatch mode. This is a royal pain because in StopWatch mode you can't skip to the next song, so you have to keep switching back and forth.SoftwareClearly excellent. Installed without any problems, easily recognized my Forge and rips CD's with speed. I set up my playlists in no time at all, and selecting artists/albums/playlists is very easy. The RIO engineers got this right.ArmBandIt's OK. I wanted to put the armband on my wrist so it was easier to view, but the armband isn't designed for such a small circumference and it must go on my upper arm. Body builders will have no problem putting this on their wrist.Unless I'm doing something wrong, the beltclip must go into the ArmBand to hold the player. Neither the booklet that came with the RIO or the 64 page PDF manual has a SINGLE word about how to use the beltclip or the armband. Big, stupid ommission from the RIO technical writers.DurabilityPlayer appears to be well built. I'm not concerned about it's long term durability but I will post back if the player has problems over the coming months.ConclusionIt's an OK player. When (if?) IRiver comes out with a stopwatch and expandable memory, I will EBay my RIO.

$review_text.: First I must state that I was building this for a friend, and he was very pleased with the result at a final price of $712 (Without OS) for a gaming PC that can make Crysis 2 and Skyrim cry.  I will include the exact specs below.  When I built this PC, it was the first one I was told to pay specific attention to looks on.  My pal doesn't know a thing about computer hardware, so I just picked as much AMD things as I could and tried to make everything red.  There are no red mobos out thee right now for less than $200, and that's a little too much for a color.  I had previously settled for a black Gigabyte board for around $120.  It had a PCIe x16, and a PCIe x16 running at x8.  A special thing about this very reasonably priced board is that it has TWO PCIe x16 xlots BOTH running at x16.  This is because of the excellent chipset, the 990FX, which supports two x16s and even one 8x after those.  It also happens to come with red trimmings.  This is the perfect board for any fast mid-range AMD computer.Friend's custom computer:-Asus Radeon HD6850 1GB GDDR5--$150-Biostar TA990FXE--$130-AMD FX-4170 4.2GHz stock clock--$120-Zalman CNPS9900MAX-R red LED heatsink--$65-WD 2TB Green SATA3 OEM--$100-4 Silent 120mm red LED Sickleflow fans--$8.50 each-AMD Memory Performance Edition Dual Channel Kit 2x4GB 1600MHz--$55-Cosair Builder Series CX600 600W 80+ Certified--$60-Thermaltake V3 Black AMD Edition--$50

$REVIEW.: I have owned and still have a Marantz AVR which is almost 15 years old and a Denon which is around 10 years old


 Both are still great AVRs (although the Marantz was never good with video)


 We moved into a new home a year ago


 I've always been a fan of whole house music
 The home we have now was pre-wired for speakers in multiple zones - so I immediately installed some nice Paradigm in-ceiling speakers and purchased a Rotel multi-zone AMP.We've had an older iPod that we've always had interfaced to the Denon to provide music throughout the house
 I recently purchased an AppleTV to stream the TB of music we have on the iMac

 Totally awesome!!! I'm a big fan of the set up


 Only - neither the Marantz or Denon support a digital output

 That and neither deck support HDMI - which has had me thinking for a while we might need an upgrade.Being a fan of both Marantz and Denon I did a lot of research on what's the best bang for our buck

 I really wanted to purchase one of the new Marantz AVRs (Marantz SR7007 Home Theater AV Receiver) but we don't have a movie room to really take advantage of that kind of purchase (at least not today)

 Based on what I needed/wanted I went back and forth with this Yamaha and a compatible Denon


 2 things influenced my purchase:  PRICE & InPut/Outputs on the rear of the AVR.So ..


after I installed and set it up yesterday.

Guess what ..


The damn thing doesn't support digital out - meaning if you are looking to wire up a second zone or have an output to another AMP to drive whole house audio (we like to listen to music) - your s*** out of luck.

well not quite


 It works fine if your wiring up analog devices or want to output the "TUNER" to your second zone

 But what the heck - everything is digital..

I use a PS3 for Blue-Ray, My Comcast Deck has HDMI and Optical outputs as does my new AppleTV


 That's right - none of these devices will work with my Rotel
 What the crap
 Who is designing these things anyway

 What really chaps my #@@$@ is that no where does any literature say this

 Not even the few slips of paper they pass off as a manual - oh yeah - you have to go on line to down load the manual.But it does support Appleplay (need to hardwire as it is not wireless)
 Not sure I even want to go this way but I will give it a try
 The Apple App looks kool on their adds so what the heck

 Maybe that is an end-around to solve my challenge

 I suppose if I had spent the extra $600 for the Marantz it may have worked but that being said

 I did get a good price on this AVR - so I will make it work.BTW - with this AVR, I did get rid of a ton of cables going with HDMI

 That and the sound quality is very nice
 Our main room has in wall Infinity speakers for surround

 The Yapo mic worked really well setting up the speakers
 The radio, AppleTv and movies look and sound great..

So I will probably keep it

 I have a couple ideas on how to solve my whole house audio....


just really chapped that an AVR like this does not support an output for all inputs (digital and analog).

$review_text.: This crimper is high in quality, very far from the typical "made in China" crimpers that just end up in landfills after a couple uses.The package says "Designed in USA. Made in Taiwan." Backed by a 2 year warranty so Trendnet certainly believes this to be of high quality. The one that comes directly from Amazon is hardware version 1.1R which seems to be the latest as of this review according to the Trendnet website.The stripper does not work on all cables as pointed out by other users but this is a problem across all crimpers not just this one so do not bypass this product because it can't strip all cables perfectly. This problem occurs because the thickness of the outer insulation varies so it is hard to get it perfect for every possible cable diameter.The ratchet mechanism seems rather useless or maybe mine is faulty because the knob to turn to release it is stuck and I usually have to close in the handles for it to automatically release. It only seems to lock the handles when they are about half way closed in but I don't know if that is how it's supposed to work or if mine is faulty. I think it should have been made to lock the handles closer to the fully closed-in position instead of half way. Either way, the ratchet handle-locking is not significant to me, as a crimper this tool does a fine job.
$SUMMARY.: Not made in China.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
autism_df <- read_csv("autism_child_data.csv")
head(autism_df)
```

```{r}
summary(autism_df)
```
- age is in chr
- missing values
- encode catagorical variables to dummy for NN/ 

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
autism_df <- autism_df %>%
  mutate(
    relation = na_if(relation, "?"),
    ethnicity = na_if(ethnicity, "?")
  )

autism_df <- autism_df %>%
  mutate(age = as.integer(age),
         gender = as.factor((gender))) %>%
  na.omit()
# Assuming your dataframe is named autism_df
autism_df$gender <- ifelse(autism_df$gender == "m", 1, 0)  
autism_df$jundice <- ifelse(autism_df$jundice == "yes", 1, 0)
autism_df$austim <- ifelse(autism_df$austim == "yes", 1, 0)
autism_df$used_app_before <- ifelse(autism_df$used_app_before == "yes", 1, 0)
autism_df$`Class/ASD` <- ifelse(autism_df$`Class/ASD` == "YES", 1, 0)  # Pay attention to case sensitivity

str(autism_df)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
# Using the fastDummies package
library(fastDummies)

autism_dummy <- dummy_cols(autism_df, select_columns = c("ethnicity", "relation"), remove_first_dummy = TRUE)

write_csv(autism_df, "autism_new.csv")
write_csv(autism_dummy, "autism_encoded.csv")


```
